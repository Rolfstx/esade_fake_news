China right here right across the river as North Korea and it is absolutely dark [Music] respect for the president of China they told them I said you'll make a much better deal Andre rid of this menace or do something about the Menace of North Korea because that's what it is it's a menace right there the relationship between China and North Korea has always been complicated China's Mao Zedong famously said that the two countries were as close as lips and teeth a relationship forged in blood and steel during the Korean War against the United States the leaders have famously kept up with that appearance since the times of Mao and North Korea's founder Kim il-sung and into the next generation with Kim jong-il but something's changed kim jong-min since he came into power in 2012 this supposedly close relationship is shaped at the seams as leader Kim has never left the country not even to visit Beijing like his father and his grandfather had this is the last time Kim was seen with a high-level Chinese leader and it's been downhill since despite North Korea's reliance on China mistrust has been brewing on both sides China and North Korea share an 880 mile border split by two rivers the Yalu and the two men both coming from the same source a slumbering supervolcano straddling the border known to Chinese as Chung by Shan and to the Koreans all Koreans as mount paektu many believe this border is the lifeline of the North Korean regime ninety percent of North Korea's trade is with China I have been reporting from inside North Korea for many years reporting will be closely watched but we expect to show you a country that the world knows very little about but we have rarely been allowed to leave their showcase capital of Pyongyang to see the rest of the country I'm curious to find out exactly what we could see from over here our plan to travel the entire border or as far as we can from the Yellow Sea in the south to the regions rattled by Pyongyang's nuclear testing in the north our starting point don-don't it's a bustling unmistakeably Chinese city of Commerce and condos connecting to the North Korean city of cinn a Jew by a single bridge the sino-korean Friendship Bridge 70 percent of China North Korea trade passes across this bridge despite UN sanctions there's a steady stream of trucks and tourists going back and forth I would love to know what's inside these trucks what this trade is [Music] so wanna see where there's trucks go when they come off the bridge I think they wind around and go into a transportation center maybe that's where they unload what they've gotten loaded up again in the morning [Music] yep written in Korean licenses so these are clearly North Korean yeah ha your thumb don't worry mom looks like the back is open let's see what he got in there this thing might may have already been unloaded [Music] so this was clearly something they loaded up took it over to North Korea earlier today and then they just came back so the probably gonna reload for tomorrow all of these trucks have North Korean license plates this was loaded up now it's empty thousands of curious Chinese tourists descend on don-don't to gawk at the reclusive neighbors from across the Yalu all along the river there are many tourist spots set up like some human safari what did you see what do you think have you been there before 18:02 thought nigga Shamu it's never been there go they sound too normal you want to go there what do you think about all this nuclear testing oh I don't think they are as good as you have better nuclear bombs in China than they do this site is called one leap across that's how close North Korea is okay here's the border right across this field this says no drones flying over the border and look at this warning do not converse or exchange objects with people on the other side of the border they told us to be careful and warnings not to irritate the North Koreans and don't even try crossing appearing across glimpses of what appears to be normal life mundane but hypnotic at the same time there is way to get even closer efficient qui m'a this is a fast boat so I guess we're gonna go over the line into into North Korea from here back and forth you says it's a it's an unclear line in the middle of the river but this river is split China on this side North Korea on that side let's see if we run in any military the captain tells us we've technically entered North Korean waters [Music] so none of this should we can't shoot is [Music] [Music] so this right here is where all the the generals houses are so it's kind of a joke they said if there's a conflict some kind of war that they can get a lot faster than China than the rest [Music] maja now all around us another surprising sight North Korean boats filled with North Korean products ginseng kimchi alcohol and cigarettes a sort of floating duty-free store cash only the other tourists in our boat were ready to shop you can see the shoes selling things right off the beach ship North Korea you can buy your cigarettes a lot cheaper but certainly not very safe all the money from this goes back to her to the people on shore back to the government official officially all right so we're told this is a pretty fancy North Korean restaurant with North Korean waitresses very North Korean entertainment an estimated 40,000 North Koreans work here in the dong dong area and send cash back directly to the North Korean government one of the highest profile jobs waitress and performers in North Korean restaurants the kindly ass is not the videotape the waitress told us they live and work in China without their families for three years with the promise of getting better jobs in Pyongyang when they get back but just outside of dong dong the symbiotic relationship starts to show signs of fraying so just heading south of dong dong heading to the was called the new district this is where a brand new bridge is being under construction for the last seven years or so but it's just almost stopped it's slowed down and it's probably because of Kim jong-un when the new leader came to power this was his father's project and it's just the buildings are not completely filled instruction is not what they thought it was going to be people are saying this is a catastrophe we meet Shing to John a truck driver who used to trade with North Korean farmers and most recently helped in the construction of the new bridge he moved his family to this new district which was built at 700,000 new residents but only a quarter of that has shown up so he's gonna take us now to his building where there were about 2,000 rooms that were supposed to be filled so we'll see what what his life is here in this new district North Korea over there well if you go through this hole yet haha North Korea everywhere so you're you're able to see normal North Korean people we we can never leave Pyongyang Kim Jong Hyun is testing so many nuclear bombs and launching missiles is there much fear here look I do die jeolla-do zombie this to me on Jan do you think he thought yeah how many back to that Yan ji devera cost yeah leave the Tong finish on it Tommy yeah you wanna do sentido boy stop wish you 100 or 10 so what do you think will happen in this new district if if this relationship with China and North Korea comes back to normal sometimes you know you know you your win do more with you their new autumn with head out with you the bridge is not opened yet oh you bet you do look at this bridge this is supposed to be the great dream this is gonna step up the relationship between these two countries China and North Korea but it's just not opening there's 350 million dollar project built by the Chinese was expected to handle 50,000 people and 20,000 vehicles a day it now sits as a bridge to nowhere literally satellite pictures show that that bridge abruptly ends on the North Korean side in a dirt field why why is it taking so long to open this bridge where the teens who are children attending a tea know how happy you either you either win here Jang song-thaek was kim jong un's uncle the one he brutally executed in 2013 for treason Jon championed closer economic integration with China at opening up North Korea's economy this bridge was supposed to be the linchpin shakeela citizen yet on the Odyssey via an employee [Music] see that watchtower that's where the North Koreans are staring at the Chinese and the Chinese have their video cameras on that tower right there to look at the North Koreans as we drive north of dong dong an unexpected scene the Chinese military training on the river with bridging exercises guards lining the road to keep people from stopping a reminder that there are 150,000 Chinese troops stationed along this border with their supposed Ally China's biggest fear is that our regime collapse would bring refugees flooding over this border and us-backed South Korean troops right up to it there's a new great wall it was existing back in the 15th century but it went down they built in 1992 again as a as tourism so they say it's about 160 yards up to the top of this mountain and hopefully we'll be able to look out over the Yellow River scene in North Korea [Music] Nicosia rule yellow never hurt students we dine on her oh yeah so right here this is this farm area right here is uh that is North Korea so this is absolutely the best view we've seen so far you can see there's the Yellow River right on that side are all the buildings the successful economy of China and then this is North Korea there's nothing but land agriculture and buildings so this is a this is just gorgeous you're afraid of these nuclear bombs that kill minutes developing thank you thank you I wish I ever dangerous reason so what do you think we can do about it can we stop him from doing this peaceful solution yeah peaceful solution whenever so long someone's looking for your total knockout we think this is dangerous very different very strange so your nessam a way they're not some way in that position you heard I know we have Guardian you some work a salut y'all let me know what you do or more yeah oh yeah get some way how you eat dry years about okay I'm not talking at each end edges I'd say the D versus all yeah so I'm gonna stop so ready I'm not for the wood doesn't your neck it what do any of you in this area I think there could be some kind of war other than what I knew all of us you need saucers don't push you on good luck thank you our next stop is G on an ancient Korean capital now on the Chinese side of the border this place is bigger than I thought it was gonna be unlike don-don't tourism appears to have come to a halt in this town okay so this is Jian I mean you just look across the river you wonder white why can't they just swim over it's so close there's no cops there's no police why don't they just come over here and get on the kind of dock and walk into freedom [Music] there have been defectors here but the border is tightening China sends back any defectors they catch it was a farmer right down here I mean you feel like you're back in then in the 1930s and North Korea punishes the defectors entire family I don't think you see those kind of plows much anymore you never see any of those in the United States this is another one to see the difference so there's China on this side and there's North Korea on the other you know you see the difference in wealth as we peer across the Yalu a man who claims to be an out-of-work tour guide approaches us with an offer so this guy told us that they just stopped the one-day tour is for tourists to come and go over to North Korea sit for the last 45 days because of the tension they're not allowing anybody to go over to North Korea he says he can take us close to it but we'll see it's we've had about 12 kilometers down the street to the very edge of Jeon and that's where the bridges that goes over to the other country I'm no idea this guy [Music] okay so we're going down underneath huh is he opening the gate I say he say he's claiming that he's sneaking us in underneath the bridge just a secret baby just is it bizarre this guy's got a mysterious where he's taking us what is this like a secret place do you know any defectors that have ever come here oh yeah do you ever get over them you can go there though man yeah boobala so he ain't usually not going on yeah well what is what is the tension is this tension because of the the nuclear tests III sorry people I'm the the Americans more than the North Koreans for stopping this tourism to Austria yeah see I knew from our defy me I'm gonna call you nervous about to being interviewed oh yeah every year the annual joint military exercises between the u.s. and South Korea sends North Korea into a defensive frenzy Yong Yong the drills just over their southern border justifies their chasing missile and nukes at all costs in turn the Chinese fault the drills for setting off North Korea I would say this is two football fields away from North Korea love to know who's in that nerves apparently call me the tour guide offers to take us further to the new bridge in town I know I say it's everything that even even here in China they're blaming the United States for this tension almost as if it has nothing to do with North Korea we could see that down in down dome where we just were there was there's tourism going back and forth there was a lot of trade we saw the trucks we saw the trains this might be completely different this further north the importance People's Republic of China but this is the bridge right here okay we're gonna get out here so was he concerned about the police tom in the country yeah we do that's a prison right there please hold on can you find out who Jenny reporting from Paul this way kim jongmin built this bridge but why did Kim German want to build this bridge for a war get ready for the war is that what Kim jong-un said what do you hear that from he tells us his friends in the Chinese military told him about the bridge what she says is just wide enough for two tanks to go across at the same time it's meant for the North Korean generals to get over the border if the war breaks out once we get back in our vans the tour guide speeds off so let's say there's a military zone so we should probably get out of here so we just walk about a thousand yards along this train rail you'll end up in North Korea as we leave the train tracks we get spotted by the Chinese army outpost in the distance so I guess it came true with the military I came out and they stopped us and take us inside to their headquarters and they told us that we're in the military area and so we shouldn't be there but then they ultimately let us go they didn't take any of our recordings so I think we're good to go but we're just gonna head up to another town to stay tonight instead of staying and Jeon so we'll see what happens next driving north we reached the source of the Yellow River Mount paektu so we're go to the top of the mountain now this is perhaps the most sacred place for all Koreans the border here is split by this immense volcano known as Cheung by Shan in Chinese and peck busan in korean it is known as the spiritual home of the korean people every day when north korea state TV starts its programming the national anthem plays against images of mount paektu and the sacred lake Chon which sits in its vast crater the volcano looms ever-present in the daily lives of North Koreans so much so that after their successful ICBM launch in July news of its success was announced against the backdrop of none other than Mount paektu testifying of the intercontinental ballistic rocket pass on 14 successful in fact the ruling Kim family derives their legitimacy from the mountain kim jong un's grandfather and father are often depicted standing on top of Mount paektu their enduring myth says the sacred blood of Mount paektu runs through the veins of the Kim family and therefore they are the rightful chosen leaders of the Korean people so we joined the busloads of tourists to hike to the top of the volcano it is according to mythology this is where the first king of the korean kingdom began he was born here also kim il-sung fought back the Japanese turned to his son Kim jong-il they say was born here although it should be said that the real records say that he was probably born in the Soviet Union but finally there's a very popular folk song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you from South Korea South Korea what do you think about this oh yeah many of the tourists here are from South Korea they only have access to their sacred mountain here on the China side whether you're in the north of the South China North Korea this is me where North Korea the rest of you Chinese tourists [Music] so there's this story in North Korea that when Kim jong-il died the ice in this lake cracked and it was so loud that it shook heaven and earth [Music] so that's the line that goes between this creature China and North Korea right there turn off did I tell you the other thing I see from North Korea over there he's on that Ridge down from the peak a little building since about a hundred miles just over this Ridge into North Korea they say that there that's where the location is for one of the nuclear test sites they've actually felt that when they sing so close what's it like to be here right next to North Korea what for the first time I see the site yeah well how do you feel very exciting in one wonderful for one person will Korea and said but is that someday will be one Korea again North Korea [Music] [Applause] [Music] leaving Mount paektu the border is now formed by the Tumen River so the signs they'll have both Chinese and we enter China's predominantly Korean region half of China's two million ethnic Koreans live in this region and this is Yong Jie their largest city and much to China's chagrin this region feels the direct impact from Pyongyang's nuclear testing that breaking news successful nuclear test by North Korea they claimed it overnight South Korea confirms this is just the latest in a series of provocations from North Korea it certainly is George this overnight test is believed to be the biggest yet last year as it did this September the ground shook here because of what happened just over the border students across Eunji were evacuated out into the open at this high school we met this security guard who felt the shakes it all happened right over here huh what it was you're dancing or like this really evaluate new glories and thoughts forever you know this was their nuclear test I don't know these are yeah cuz see in Saudi there comes with me can you think there's gonna be another nuclear test on that site he's gonna know so it doesn't was lawyer we turn and head towards the border towards the town of nan ping along the river the Tumen River is shallower and calmer than the Yalu making it more manageable for defectors since the mid-1990s almost 30,000 North Koreans have fled to China and in recent years violence and crime have also crossed the border they say that the at the North Korean soldiers are underpaid and underfed and so that's one reason why they've been coming over the river it's Rob the people here and in China and in few cases in non pink murder we run into a checkpoint he's looking through all of our bags who they asking for they asking their boss no the security of the national security is actually FBI's it's likely after the state security agent arrives about the border they didn't send any about the killings this can't be the same right I mean this is this most different than it was months ago even local they keep us on the side of the road for over an hour although they check every vehicle that passes our van was the only one they turn inside out after taking pictures of our team and our passports they let us go the ultimate decision was to turn us around send us back to where we came from and not allow us anywhere closer he said further because the border is oh the guy is following us will they be following us from it from now on who knows but we're gonna maybe try a different route back to the border and see what's going as we go further north you know clearly in the south it was pretty easy we were not really stopped by any police or security but now at the further we go north and we get closer to the more pure Korean areas and towns then clearly it's getting a little bit more difficult they're more sensitive we later learned that just a month earlier seven defectors overpowered North Korean border guards and crossed into China near non ping we make one last attempt for the border and head towards the border town of Tumen named after the river we have yet to see we pass a sign saying just eight minutes to North Korea this is another region Kim jong-un's uncle had hoped to develop with China before his execution this is not far from the Russian border city for 30-yard river to get across you know song the Kim Jong Il the posters are on top of that building it's the first time we've seen that across the room is the furthest north we've gotten so far it's probably the most narrow River and also most shallow it's the easiest ones to defect cut the Chinese flag and they get the North Korean flag side-by-side is that why does she take that part out but once again they stopped us from shooting the security agent told us we had two choices leave or sightsee with the rest of the tourists no more reporting so we sightsee what we're really seeing is the further we go north and the more strict they become here on the China side and you know the Chinese came up to us and said we can't shoot we can't shoot anything across to the other side if they do the North Koreans do see someone doing this they will complain to the authorities on this side the China side so it's obviously this guy's job to stop us from doing it now we saw people with our cell phones taking video across there everybody said partly because I'm a foreigner that they're even more strict all right we're getting followed again this time by this black car I think probably until we get out of this town so this has been quite a trip I think we got to wrap it up and head home all these towns are I think they're gonna be watching see if we're gonna come since our trip Kim jong-un conducted North Korea's sixth nuclear test and what appears to be open defiance of China Beijing has committed two additional rounds of new UN sanctions banning all imports of North Korean coal seafood textiles and now capping Pyongyang's fuel imports until Beijing decides to really cut off the lifeline the trucks will still criss cross the bridge in dondon [Music] North Korea will still find a way to send its workers and the empty bridges spanning their border stand ready for whatever they were supposedly built for Fears on the Chinese side of the border are not over imminent war but the disruption of their livelihood China's reluctant tolerance of Kim jong-un and the inconvenience status quo has always been and always will be about stability within their own borders [Music] you

9,0,Coronavirus: UK lockdown to be eased next week - BBC News,"The Prime Minister will make a statement on Sunday setting out his plans to ease the lockdown.  Boris Johnson said some changes will come into force the next day. Ministers have hinted that the construction sector should return to work wherever possibleand that offices, public spaces and transport systems should be adapted to maintain safety and distancing.

will come into force the next day ministers have hinted that the construction sector should return to work wherever possible and that offices public spaces and transport systems should be adapted to maintain safety and distancing our political correspondent Alex Forsythe has been talking to businesses and residents and local traders in morton and marsh in Gloucestershire the market town of Morton in Marsh is far from its bustling self life for many is largely on pause it's been strange it's Dave's had a store here for more than 30 years he's managed to trade enough in recent weeks to tick over but only just I don't think it'd be as good as it was ever ever this could be thankful for the trade we got Warwick in the Cotswolds countryside this town relies on tourism as well as local trade tea shops cafes and pubs nervous about the future if social distancing is here to stay this hair salon just off the high street this similar concern the owners trying to stay positive and plan for a possible reopening but conscious you have to be close to cut hair I'm not sure what the guidelines are going to be and I don't think we'll be working at full capacity which is absolutely not good after being locked it down but until they turn on it tell us what it is I can't get a kind of action many businesses and families are wondering what comes next the official review of the lockdown is tomorrow but don't expect to hear much about government plans until Sunday and increasingly it's a question of how ministers balance concerns about the country's health with worries about its wealth and general well-being today the Prime Minister signaled some measures might ease from Monday but it's likely to be gradual on the edge of town Anna's two sons are keen to return to school finding work here at home hard mate it's just stressful I just want to sit down and start doing the work tricky Oh wake up come back Kenny X what's good about ya say it like it is Jamie most immortan are simply finding ways to cope staying up beat these neighbors meat every morning for some distant company I live on my own see so just break the day up no end just outside town the garden centers tentatively begun trading because of essentials on sale but the past few weeks have been tough from thinking that we might actually lose the business to come in through the other side and we're now trading and it looks as though you know hopefully fingers crossed that we might survive here now they want clarity from government about long-term business support and to give customers confidence I need a clear message one way or other of what's going to happen the lockdown is an easy one to impose and taking the handbrake off is difficult now that happens will be decided far from here but felt across this town where many are trying to be optimistic the feeling the personal and economic cost Alex Forsyth BBC news Morton in Marsh now the government's job retention scheme supporting the salaries of over 6 million workers is estimated to cost 39 billion pounds by July now given the heavy expense the Chancellor has to balance the needs of the economy against the state of the government's finances and our economics editor faisal islam is here with me to talk about this let's talk about the balancing act and what is he measuring well government as a series of delicate dilemmas now that was very telling the Prime Minister in the House of Commons said that there could be an economic disaster not if the lockdown was prolonged but if there was a second wave of the pandemic and that tells you that what we get on Sunday as Laura said before is going to be step by step incremental baby step by baby step even in terms of the how the lockdown will change and I think that there are other trade-offs and dilemmas you know they haven't decided between the unions in the business water safe workspaces yet and also on this issue of the job retention scheme the furloughing scheme you can see the government on the one and wants to send out a signal that employees should not get too used to this scheme but on the other doesn't want to precipitate anybody taking action on jobs too soon it'll only be taken away very gradually as well all of these dilemmas on costs on jobs on health I think will be put into sharp relief tomorrow morning when we get the most thorough look at the economy we'd hoped it'd be a v-shaped bounce-back it may not look like that when we get the new forecast from the Bank of England tomorrow morning many thanks again as well

Some people ask me the question, ""What has physics done for me lately? \xa0I mean, do I\nget better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?"" \xa0And the\nanswer is yes. \xa0You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy. \xa0We\nphysicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor. \xa0We helped to create the\nfirst computer. \xa0We helped to construct the internet. \xa0We wrote the World Wide Web. \xa0In\naddition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI\nscans, PET scans, x-rays. \xa0In other words, almost everything you see in your living room,\nalmost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a\nphysicist. Now, I got interested in physics when I was\na child. When I was eight,\na great scientist had just died. \xa0I still remember my elementary school teacher coming\ninto the room and announcing that the greatest scientist of our era has just passed away.\n\xa0And that day, every newspaper published a picture of his desk. \xa0The desk of Albert\nEinstein. \xa0And the caption said, I\'ll never forget, ""The unfinished manuscript of the\ngreatest work of the greatest scientist of our time."" \xa0And I said to myself, ""Why couldn\'t\nhe finish it? \xa0I mean, what\'s so hard? \xa0It\'s a homework problem, right? \xa0Why didn\'t he\nask his mother? \xa0Why can\'t he finish this problem?"" \xa0So as a child of eight, I decided\nto find out what was this problem. Years later, I began to realize that it was\nthe theory of everything, the Unified Field Theory. An equation that would summarize\nall the physical forces in the universe. \xa0An equation like E=mc². \xa0That equation is half\nan inch long and that equation unlocks the secret of the stars. \xa0Why do the stars shine?\n\xa0Why does the galaxy light up? \xa0Why do we have energy on the earth? But then there was another thing that happened\nto me when I was around eight years old. \xa0I got hooked on the Saturday morning TV shows.\n\xa0In particular, Flash Gordon. \xa0And I was hooked. \xa0I mean, every Saturday morning watching\nprograms about alien from outer space, star ships, ray guns, invisibility shields, cities\nin the sky, that was for me. \xa0But after a few years, I began to notice something. \xa0First\nof all, I began to notice that well, I didn\'t have blond hair and blue eyes, I didn\'t have\nmuscles like Flash Gordon, but it was a scientist who made the series work. \xa0In particular,\na physicist. \xa0He was the one who discovered the ray gun, the star ships.\xa0He was the one who created the invisibility shield.\n\xa0And then I realized something else. \xa0If you want to understand the future, you have\nto understand physics. \xa0Physics is at the foundation of all the gadgetry, the wizardry,\nall the marvels of the technological age, all of it can be traced to the work of a physicist. \xa0\nPhysics and the Impossible Physics and the Impossible Most of science fiction is in fact well within\nthe laws of physics, but possible within maybe 100 years. \xa0And then we have \nimpossibilities that may take 1,000 years or more. \xa0That includes time travel, warp\ndrive, higher dimensions, portals through space and time, star gates, worm holes. You know, if you were to meet your grandparents\nat the year 1900, they were dirt farmers back then. \xa0They didn\'t live much beyond the age\nof 40, on average. \xa0Long distance communication in the year 1900 was yelling at your neighbor.\n\xa0And yet, if they could see you now, with iPads and iPods and satellites and GPS and\nlaser beams, how would they view you? \xa0They They would view you as a wizard or sorcerer. However, if we can now meet our grandkids\nof the year 2100, how would we view them? We would view them as gods, like in Greek\nmythology. \xa0Zeus could control objects around him by pure thought. \xa0Materialize objects\njust by thinking. \xa0And there\'re perks to being a Greek god, Venus had a perfect body,\na timeless body. \xa0And we are beginning now to unravel the genetics at the molecular level,\nof the aging process. \xa0And then Apollo, he had a chariot that he could ride across the\nheavens. \xa0We will finally have that flying car that we\'ve always wanted to have in our garage. By the year 2100,\nwe will have the power of the gods. To paraphrase Arthur C. Clark, ""Any sufficiently\nadvanced technology is indistinguishable from from divinity."" So let\'s now begin our story. The History of Physics The history of physics is the history of modern\ncivilization. \xa0Before Isaac Newton, before Galileo, we were shrouded with the mysteries\nof superstition. \xa0People believed in all sorts of different kinds of spirits and demons.\n\xa0What made the planets move? \xa0Why do things things interact with other things? \xa0It was a mystery. So, back in the Middle Ages, for example,\npeople read the works of Aristotle. \xa0And Aristotle asked the question, ""Why do objects\nmove toward the earth? \xa0And that\'s because,"" he said, ""objects yearn, yearn to be united\nwith the earth. \xa0\xa0And why do objects slow down when you put them in motion? \xa0Objects\nin motion slow down because they get tired."" These are the works of Aristotle, which\nheld sway for almost 2,000 years until the beginning of modern physics with Galileo and\nIsaac Newton. When the ancients looked at the sky, the\nsky was full of mystery and wonder, and in the year 1066, the most important date on\nthe British calendar, there was a comet, a comet which sailed over the battlefield of\nHastings. \xa0It frightened the troops of King Harold, and a young man from Normandy, swept\ninto England and defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, creating the modern British\nmonarchy. But the question is, where did the comet come\nfrom? \xa0What was this comet that mysteriously paved the way for the coming of the British\nmonarchy? Well, believe it or not, that same comet,\nthe very same comet that initiated the British monarchy, sailed over London once again in\n1682. \xa0This time, everyone was asking the question, ""Where do comets come from? \xa0Do\nthey signal the death of the king? \xa0Why do we have messengers from heavens in the sky?""\n\xa0Well, one man dared to penetrate the secrets of comets, and that was Isaac Newton. \xa0In\nfact, when Isaac Newton was only 23 years old, he stumbled upon the universal force\nof gravitation. According to one story, he was walking on\nhis estate in Woolsthorpe, and he saw an apple fall. \xa0And then Isaac Newton saw the moon,\nand then he asked the key question which helped to unlock the heavens. \xa0If apples falls,\ndoes the moon also fall? \xa0And the answer was, ""Yes."" \xa0And answer overturned thousands\nof years of mystery and speculation about the motions of the heavens. \xa0The moon is\nin freefall, just like an apple. \xa0The moon is constantly falling toward the earth. \xa0It\ndoesn\'t hit the earth, because it spins around the earth, and the earth is round, but it\'s\nacting under a force, a force of gravity. So Newton immediately tried to work out the\nmathematics and he realized that the mathematics of the 1600\'s was not sufficient to work out\nthe motion of a falling moon. \xa0So what did Isaac Newton do? \xa0When he was 23 years old,\nnot only did he stumble upon the force of gravity, but he also created calculus. \xa0In\nfact, he created calculus at the rate at which you learn it, when you are a freshman in college.\n\xa0And why did he create calculus? \xa0To calculate the motion of a falling moon. \xa0The mathematics\nof his age was incapable of calculating the trajectories of objects moving under an inverse\nsquare force field, and that\'s what Isaac Newton did. \xa0He worked out the motion of\nthe moon. \xa0And then he realized that if he understands the moon, he also understands\nthe motion of the planets in the solar system. And Isaac Newton invented a new telescope.\n\xa0It was the reflecting telescope and he was tracking the motion of this comet. Well, it turns out that everyone was talking\nabout the comet, including a rather wealthy Englishman by the name of Edmund Haley. So Edmund Haley, being a wealthy merchant, decided to make\na trip to Cambridge to talk to England\'s illustrious scientist, Sir Isaac Newton. \xa0Well, Edmund\nHaley asked Newton, ""What do you make of this comet? \xa0No one understands comets, they\'re\na mystery. \xa0They\'ve been fascinating people for centuries, for millennia, what are your\nthoughts?"" \xa0And then, I paraphrase, but Isaac Newton said something like this, he said,\n""Oh, that\'s easy. \xa0That comet is moving at a perfect ellipse. \xa0It\'s moving in an inverse\nsquare force field. \xa0I\'ve been tracking it every day with my reflecting telescope and\nthe path of that comet conforms to my mathematics exactly."" \xa0And of course, we don\'t know what\nEdmund Haley\'s reaction was, but I paraphrase, he must have said something like this, he\nsaid, ""For God\'s sake, man, why don\'t you publish the greatest work in all of scientific\nhistory? \xa0If correct, you have decoded the secret of the stars, the secret of the heavens.\n\xa0Nobody understands where comets come from."" And then Newton responded and said, ""Oh,\nwell, it costs too much. \xa0I mean, I\'m not a wealthy man, it would cost too much to summarize\nthis calculus that I\'ve invented and to work out all the motion of the stars."" \xa0And then\nHaley must have said this, he must have said, ""Mr. Newton, I am a wealthy man. \xa0I have\nmade my fortune in commerce. \xa0I will pay for the publication of the greatest scientific\nwork in any language."" \xa0And it was Principia. The principals, the mathematical principals\nthat guide the heavens. Believe it or not, this is perhaps one of\nthe most important works ever written by a human being in the 100,000 years since we\nevolved from Africa. \xa0Realize that this book sets into motion a physics of the universe.\n\xa0Forces that control the motion of the planets, forces which can be calculated, forces which\ngovern the motion of cannonballs, rockets, pebbles, everything that moves, moves according\nto the laws of motion and the calculus of Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, even today, when we launch our space\nprobes, we don\'t use Einstein\'s equations, they only apply when you get near the speed\nof light or near a black hole. \xa0We use Newton\'s laws of gravity. \xa0They are so precise that\nwhen we shoot a space probe right past the rings of Saturn, we use exactly the same equations\nthat Isaac Newton unraveled in the 1600\'s. That\'s why we have glorious photographs\nof the rings of Saturn. \xa0That\'s why we have fly-by\'s right past Neptune. \xa0That\'s why\nwe\'ve been able to unravel the secrets of the solar system, compliments of the laws\nof motion of Isaac Newton. So what Newton did was not only did he set\ninto motion the ability to calculate planets, he also set into motion a mechanics. \xa0Machines\nnow operated upon well-defined laws: Newton\'s three laws of motion. \xa0The first law of motion\nsays that objects in motion stay in motion forever, unless acted on by an outside force.\n\xa0You see that in an ice skating rink. \xa0You should a puck and it goes all the way down\nforever, unless acted upon by an outside force. That\'s different from Aristotle\'s law of\nmotion. \xa0Aristotle said, ""Objects in motion eventually stop, because they get tired."" The second law of motion says, force is mass\ntimes acceleration. \xa0And that equation made possible the Industrial Revolution. \xa0Steam\nengines, locomotives, factories, machines, all of it due to the mechanics set into motion\nby Isaac Newton\'s second law of motion, force is equal to mass times acceleration. And then Newton had a third law of motion.\n\xa0For every action, there\'s an equal and opposite reaction, that\'s the law of rockets. \xa0That\'s\nwhy we have rockets that can sail into outer space. which could have been calculated by Isaac\nNewton himself. So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel\nthe first force of the universe, gravity, that number, 25,000 miles per hour, that\'s\nthe escape velocity of the earth, a number So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel\nthe first force of the universe, gravity, that set into motion the Industrial Revolution.\n\xa0A revolution which toppled the kings and queens of Europe, which displaced feudalism,\nushering in the modern age. \xa0All because a 23-year-old gentleman looked up and asked\nthe question, ""Does the moon also fall?"" You know, when I was a kid growing up in California,\nI would see pictures of the Empire State Building. And I said to myself, ""How could that possibly\nbuild such a big building and not know that it\'s going to fall? \xa0I mean, why doesn\'t\nit fall? \xa0They didn\'t build scale models of the thing, you couldn\'t have an Empire\nState Building that big to test whether it\'s going to fall or not. \xa0How did they know\nahead of time that that building wouldn\'t fall? \xa0And the answer is: \xa0Newton\'s laws\nof motion. In fact, today, I teach Newton\'s laws of motion,\nand you can actually calculate the forces on every single brick of the empire state\nbuilding, using Newton\'s second law of motion, force is mass\ntimes acceleration. When Newton unraveled\nthe force of gravity, that was the first force. Now, let\'s take a look at the\nsecond force, an even greater force which has touched all of our lives, and that is\nthe electromagnetic force. Ever since humans saw lightning bolts light\nup the sky, ever since they were terrified by the sound of thunder, they\'ve been asking,\n""Do the gods propel lightening bolts and create thunder? \xa0Are they angry at us?"" Scientists began to\nrealize that the lightning bolts and the thunder can be duplicated on the earth. \xa0That\nwe can actually create mini lightning bolts using electricity. But it wasn\'t until the 1800\'s that finally\nwe begin to unlock the second great force which rules the universe, the electromagnetic\nforce. Michael Faraday would give Christmas lectures in London, fascinating everyone from\nadults to children. \xa0And he would demonstrate the incredible properties of electricity. Some people, for example, ask a simple question.\n\xa0If you\'re in a car or an airplane, you get hit by a lightening bolt, why don\'t you all\nget electrocuted? \xa0Why don\'t you all die? Well, Faraday answered the question. \xa0He\nwould create a cage.\xa0He would walk into this steel cage, electrify it, and\nhe wouldn\'t get electrocuted at all. \xa0That\'s called a Faraday cage and every time you walk\ninto \xa0metal structure, you get shielded by this metal object. Well, what Michael Faraday did was, he helped to unleash the second great revolution\nwith something calls Faraday\'s Law. A moving wire in a magnetic\nfield, has this electrons pushed, creating an electrical current. That simple idea unleashed the electric revolution. And that\'s why we have hydroelectric generators, dams that produce enormous amounts of power, That\'s why people build nuclear power plants. That\'s why we have electricity in this room right now! On a very small scale, you use that in your\nbicycle. \xa0When you put a bicycle lamp on your bicycle, the turning of the wheel spins\na magnet. \xa0The magnet then pushes electrons in a wire and that\'s why electricity lights\nup in your bicycle lamp. So in other words, electricity and magnetism were unified into\na single force. \xa0We once thought that electricity and magnetism were separate. \xa0Now we know\nthey are in fact the same force. So if a moving magnet can create an electric\nfield, this means that a moving electric field can create a magnetic field. \xa0But if they\ncan create each other, why can\'t they oscillate and create a wave? \xa0So that moving electric\nfields create magnetic fields, create electric fields, create magnetic fields, infinitum\nto create a wave? Well, around the time of the American Civil\nWar, a mathematical physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, calculated, using the work of Faraday,\nthe velocity of this wave. And in one of the greatest breakthroughs\nof all time, James Clerk Maxwell calculated the velocity of this wave and found out it\nwas the velocity of light. \xa0And then he made this incredible discovery: this is light.\n\xa0That\'s what light is. \xa0It doesn\'t by accident travel at the speed of electricity, it is\nlight itself. wave, and that wave is called light. And the equations were written down by James\nClerk Maxwell. \xa0Unfortunately, Michael Faraday And the equations were written down by James\nClerk Maxwell. \xa0Unfortunately, Michael Faraday himself did not have a formal education. \xa0He\ncould not put into mathematical form his own work. \xa0James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical\nphysicist, just like myself. \xa0He wrote down the mathematical physics of oscillating electric\nfields and magnetic fields and they are called Maxwell\'s equations. \xa0These equations have\nto be memorized by every physicist in grad school. \xa0You cannot get your PhD without\nmemorizing these equations. \xa0Every engineer deals with radar and radio has to memorize these equations. \xa0And so, if you go to Berkley,\nwhere I got my PhD, you can buy a t-shirt which says, ""In the beginning God said, the\nfour-dimensional divergence of an antisymmetric, second rank tensor equals zero, and there\nwas light. Ladies and gentlemen, this\nis the equation for light. of light, we physicists today want to have\na one inch equation that summarize all physical reality. Well, Michael Faraday in his own lifetime\nwas heralded as a great scientist, and how many scientists do you know appear on money?\n\xa0Well, there he is, on the British 20-pound note. \xa0So it\'s very rare that a scientist\nappears on a nation\'s currency, but so great was a contribution of Michael Faraday that\nthere he is on the 20-pound note. \xa0\xa0\nThe Electromagnetic Revolution\xa0and The Nuclear Age The consequences of the electromagnetic revolution\ntouch all of us. \xa0This is a picture of the The consequences of the electromagnetic revolution\ntouch all of us. \xa0This is a picture of the earth from outer space. \xa0Look at this picture.\n\xa0Europe electrified, you can actually see the fruits of all of our efforts to create\nelectricity, to energize our lives, in one picture, seeing the earth from outer space.\n\xa0So let\'s now talk about how Faraday and Maxwell\'s work touches your life as well. This is the internet. \xa0The internet is a\nsimple byproduct of the electromagnetic force. And\nyou can see that where there is the internet, there is prosperity. \xa0There is science, there\'s\nentertainment, there\'s economic activity. Where there\'s no internet, there\'s poverty.\n\xa0And in the future, the internet will be miniaturized and it will be placed in your\nglasses. \xa0Your glasses will recognize people\'s faces and display their biography next to\nthe image as you talk to them, and then when they speak Chinese to you, your glasses will\ntranslate Chinese into English and print out subtitles right beneath their image. \xa0So\nin the future, you will know exactly who you are talking to without even talking to them,\nand this means that at a cocktail party, if you\'re looking for a job, but you don\'t know\nwho the heavy hitters are, in the future you will know exactly who to suck up to. In the future, chips will only cost a penny, because we can manufacture tinier and tinier transistors You will have Faraday\'s electromagnetic force inside your body This is a pill. It has a chip in it. The chip is smaller than an aspirin pill, It also has a TV camera and a magnet. When you swallow it, the magnet guides the camera, taking pictures of your stomach, your intestines, because we all know what middle-aged men fear the most: colonoscopies. And, this gives new meaning for the expression ""intel inside."" Now, let\'s talk about the next great forces\nwhich rule the universe. \xa0We talked about gravity, which allows us to calculate the\nmotion of the planets. \xa0The mechanics created by Newton helped to unleash the Industrial\nRevolution. \xa0Michael Faraday worked out the electromagnetic force, which gave us the wonders\nof the electric age. \xa0And now, let\'s talk about the nuclear age, the stars and the sun.\n\xa0People have been fascinated by the sun, Apollo was the god that strode across the\nheavens in his fiery chariot. \xa0But hey, when you calculate how long coal or oil will burn\nlike the sun, you realize that in just a few hundred years, the sun would burn to a crisp.\n\xa0So what could possibly last for billions of years? \xa0There must be a new force, a nuclear\nforce. Einstein and others helped to unravel the\nsecret of the stars. \xa0The nuclear force comes in two types, weak and strong. \xa0The weak nuclear force governs radioactive decay. The strong nuclear force is one of the strongest forces in the entire universe. It\'s so strong it holds our protons together, ever since Genesis, the beginning of time. The equation which allows for the liberation of energy is Einstein\'s famous equation E=mc². What Einstein showed was that the faster you move, the heavier you get. So your weight is not a constant. When you move very rapidly you get heavier, something which we measure every day in the laboratory. Now, this means\nthat the energy of motion transformed into mass, because you get heavier. \xa0Now, listen\ncarefully. \xa0The faster you move, the heavier you get. \xa0Which means that the energy of\nmotion, ""E"" turns into ""m"", your mass. \xa0And the relationship between E and m is very simple,\nit takes one second to write it down on a sheet of paper, it is exactly E=mc². So the nuclear force helped to explain the\nsecret of the sun. \xa0But it also created a Pandora\'s box, because inside the nucleus\nof the atom, are particles. \xa0And when you smash these particles, what do you get? \xa0More\nparticles. \xa0And when you smash them, what More particles. In fact, we are drowning in subatomic particles. Hundreds, thousands of subatomic particles every time\nwe smash atoms. Now, we smash atoms using something called atom smashers, or particle accelerators. I built my own particle accelerator when I was in high school. When I was in high school, I went to my mom one day and I said, ""Can\nI have permission to build a 2.3 million electron volt betatron particle accelerator in the\ngarage?"" \xa0And my mom said, ""Sure, why not? And don\'t forget to take out the garbage!"" And as a high school kid I asked for 400 pounds of transformer steel. I asked for 22 miles of cooper wire. Because I wanted to create a six kilowatter, 10,000 gauss magnetic field, to energize my atom smasher. With 22 miles of copper wire, how could you wind it? We did it on the high school football field. With 22 miles of copper wire on the goalpost, gave it to my mother, she ran to the 50 yard line unraveling the spool of wire, she gave it to my father who then ran to the goalpost and we wound 22 miles of copper wire on the high school football field. Well, finally my atom smasher was ready. It consumed six kilowatts of power, that\'s every single ounce of power my house could deliver. I plugged my ears, I closed my eyes, I turned on the power, and I heard this huge crackling sound as six kilowatts of power surged through my capacitor bank and then I heard a ""pop pop pop"" sound as I blew out every single circuit breaker in the house. The whole house was plunged in darkness. My poor mom, every time she\'d come home she\'d see the lights flicker and die. And she must\'ve wondered ""why couldn\'t I have a son who plays baseball?"" Why can\'t he learn basket ball? And for god\'s sake why can\'t he find a nice Japanese girl?"" I mean, why does he have to build these machines in the garage? Well, these machines that I built in my garage earned the attention of a physicist Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb. And he arranged for me to get a scholarship to Harvard. And my career got a head start! He knew exactly what I was doing. I didn\'t have to explain to him that I was experimenting with antimatter. I was creating anti-electrons in my mom\'s garage, and using atom smashers to eventually create beams of antimatter. Antimatter is the opposite of matter. It has an opposite charge. So an electron has negative charge. The positron, or anti-electron, has positive charge. This means that you can now create anti-molecules and anti-atoms. Anti-hydrogen was made at CERN, outside Geneva, Switzerland And also at Fermilab outside Chicago Where you have anti-electrons circulating around anti-protons. And in Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island just recently they detected anti-helium! We have two anti-protons with two anti-neutrons to create anti-helium. For every piece of matter there is a counterpart made out of anti-matter. And when the two collide, by the way, it releases the greatest energy source in the universe. It is 100 percent conversion of matter to energy by Einstein\'s equations E=mc squared. Inside the nucleus of the atom we have particles upon particles when you smash them apart. In the 1950\'s we were drowning in subatomic particles. In fact, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, once made a statement. He declared that ""the Nobel Prize in physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle this year."" That how many particles were being discovered. So, let\'s talk about the Particle Zoo. Right now, we physicists have unlocked hundreds, thousands of subatomic particles. And we\'ve been able to piece them together into a jigsaw puzzle. It\'s called the ""standard model."" It has 36 quarks, 19 free parameters, 3 generations of quarks no rhyme, no reason, but this is the most fundamental basis of reality that we physicists have been able to construct. Billions of dollars. 20 Nobel prizes. have gone into the creation of the standard model. and it is the ugliest theory known to science, but it works. There\'s one piece missing, and that one piece missing is called the Higgs-Boson. We expect to find it. We want to create a higher version of this theory and that theory, we think, is string theory. String theory is based on the simple idea that all the four forces of the universe Gravity, electromagnetic force, and the two nuclear forces, can be viewed as music. Music of tiny little rubber bands. So if I had a super microscope, and I could look right into the heart of an electron What would I see? I would see a vibrating rubber band. And if I ""twang"" it, it turns into a neutrino. I ""twang"" it again and it turns into a quark. I ""twang"" it again and it turns into a Yang-Mills particle In fact, if I ""twang"" it enough times, I get thousands of subatomic particles that have been cataloged patiently by physicists. String theory, we think, is a theory of everything. Now, string theory, in turn, can be summarized in an equation about an inch long That\'s my equation! This is called string field theory. And how will we test it? We are building a machine. The biggest machine of science ever built in the history of the human race. Outside Geneva, Switzerland. It is the Large Hadron Collider. So the Higgs-Boson, we think, will be created by the Large Hadron Collider. A tube 17 miles in circumference with two beams of protons circulating in opposite directions Then slamming together creating a shower of particles, and among these particles we hope to find the Higgs-Boson, but not only that. We hope to find particles even beyond the Higgs-Boson. The next set of particles beyond the Higgs-Boson are ""sparticles"" The next layer of the jigsaw puzzle are called sparticles—super particles Nothing but higher vibrations, higher musical notes of a vibrating string. And what else can we do? We can also unlock secrets of the big bang. You see, Einstein\'s equations break down and the instant of the big band and the center of a black hole. The two most interesting places in the universe are beyond our reach using Einstein\'s equations. We need a higher theory, and that\'s where string theory comes in. String theory takes you before the Big Bang, before Genesis itself. And what does string theory say? It says that there is a multiverse of universes. Where did the Big Bang come from? Well, Einstein\'s equations give us this compelling picture that we are like insects on a soap bubble. A gigantic soap bubble which is expanding. and we are trapped like flies on fly paper, we can\'t escape the soap bubble and that\'s called the Big Bang Theory. String theory says there should be other bubbles out there in a multiverse of bubbles. When two universes collide it can form another universe. When a universe splits in half it can create two universes, and that, we think, is the Big Bang. The Big Bang is caused by either the collision of universes or by the fissioning of universes. If there are other dimensions, if there are other universes, can we go between universes? Well that, of course, is very hard, but Alice in Wonderland gives us a possibility that maybe one day we might create a wormhole between universes. This is a wormhole. Think of taking a sheet of paper and putting two dots on it. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But if I can fold, if I can fold that sheet of paper Then perhaps I can create a shortcut. A shortcut through space and time, called a wormhole. This is a genuine solution of Einstein\'s equations. We can actually see this in string theory. The question is: how practical is it to go through one of these things? We don\'t know. In fact there\'s a debate among physicists today, Stephen Hawking, many physicists are jumping into the game of trying to figure out whether it\'s physically possible to go all the way through a wormhole. Because if you could, then you might be able to use this as a time machine. Since string theory is a theory of everything, it\'s also a theory of time. And time machines are allowed in Einstein\'s equations, but to build one is extremely difficult. Far more energy is required than a simple Delorean with plutonium. You know, trillions of years from now the universe is going to get awfully cold. We think the universe is headed for a big freeze. Stars will blink out, stars will cease to twinkle, and the universe will be so big it\'ll be very cold. At that point all intelligent life in the universe must die. The laws of physics are a death warrant for all intelligent life. There is only one way to escape the death of the universe, and that is leave the universe. We are now entering the realm of science fiction, but at least now we have equations equations of string theory which will now allow us to calculate if it is possible to go through a wormhole, to go to another universe where it\'s warmer, and perhaps we can start all over again. If you were to summarize the march of physics through the last 10,000 years it would be the distillation of the laws of nature into four fundamental forces. Gravity, electricity and magnetism, and the two nuclear forces. But then the question is ""is there a fifth force?"" A force beyond the forces we can measure in the laboratory. And believe it or not there are physicists who have looked very carefully for a fifth force. Some people think maybe it\'s psychic phenomena. Maybe it\'s telepathy. Maybe it\'s something called psi power. Maybe it\'s the power of the mind. Maybe consciousness! Well, I\'m a physicist. We believe in testing theories to make sure they are falsifiable and reproducible. We want to make sure that on demand your theory works every single time without exception. And if your theory fails one time, It\'s wrong. In other words, Einstein\'s theory has to work every single time without exception. One time Einstein\'s theory is proven to be wrong, the whole theory is wrong. Well, so far we can reproduce these four physical theories, but a fifth theory cannot be reproduced. We\'ve looked for it. Some people think that maybe a fifth force may be short range. Like, not over the nucleus of an atom, but ranging over several feet. And we can\'t find any. We physicists in the last ten years have discovered a new energy source larger than the galaxy itself. Dark energy. Realized in our universe today 73 percent of our universe, matter and energy, 73 percent is in the form of dark energy. The energy of nothing! That\'s what\'s bl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wing the galaxies farther and farther apart. That\'s the energy of the Big Bang itself. Kids ask the question," """"If the universe banged"," what made it bang?"""" And the answer is dark energy. 73 percent of the universe\'s energy is dark energy. 23 percent is dark matter. Dark matter is invisible matter. If I held it in my hand it would go right through my hand. It holds the galaxy together. 23 percent of the universe is dark matter. Stars made out of hydrogen and helium make up four percent of the universe. And then what about us? We", the higher elements. We made out of oxygen, carben, nitrogen, tungsten, iron We make up .03 percent of the universe. In other words, we are the exception. The universe is mainly made out of dark energy. The universe is mainly made out of dark matter. Overwhelming the stars, overwhelming the galaxies in fact. Now what is dark matter, which makes up 23 percent of the universe? No one knows. String theory gives us a clue, but there\'s no definitive answer. So in other words, for you young aspiring physicists out there in the audience, You may be saying to yourself right now," """"Why should I go into physics? Because you guys already have a candidate for the unified field theory", right? Just realize that every single physics textbook is WRONG. Every single physics textbook on the Earth says that the universe is mainly made out of atoms Right? There it is! The universe is mainly made out of atoms. Wrong! In the past ten years we have come to the realization that most of the universe is dark. And there\'s a whole shelf full of Nobel Prizes for the young people who can figure out the secret of dark matter and dark energy. Let me give some advice to you if you are a young physicist, perhaps just getting out of high school You have dreams of being Einstein, you have dreams of working on string theory and things like that and then you hit freshman physics. Let me be blunt: We physicists flunk most student taking elementary physics. And we\'re more or less encouraged to do so by the engineering department. We don\'t want to train engineers who make bridges that fall down. We don\'t want to create engineers that create skyscrapers that fall over. There\'s a bottom line: you have to know the laws of mechanics. So before you can work with the laws of Einstein, you have to work with\nthe laws of friction, levers, pulleys and\ngears. As a consequence we have a very high flunk-out rate in elementary physics. So if you\'re a young physicist graduating from high school with stars in your eyes, and you encounter freshman physics for the first time, watch out! If you have a rough time, that\'s the way it is. I started out my life as an experimental physicist. Then I went to Harvard and then I talked to my adviser, one of the world\'s greatest experiment physicists, Professor Pound And he told me maybe it\'s time to give it a rest. He said to me," """"Your skills are much better suited to what you love the most"," which is theory."""" """"Mathematics. The world of higher dimensions."""" And I realized that he was probably right. The thing about physics", or science that really intrigues me the most is to find the most fundamental basis for everything Rather than trying to massage a theory, or make a theory prettier," Why not find out why it works? What makes it tick? And that\'s what I do for a living. I\'m a theoretical physicist. Thank you very much!']""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,0,Inside the Lab That Could Save the World From Climate Change (Unsolvable: Episode 2),"June 14 -- Most of the talk about climate change has been about reducing the emissions we’re going to make; but what about the emissions we’ve already made?

climate change has been about reducing the emissions we're going to make but what about the emissions we've already made so if we cut all emissions to zero tomorrow it could be that the world still warms up quite a lot over this century because of what are called carbon feedbacks since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution we've already added 531 billion tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere that has led to a roughly one and a half degree rise in average global surface temperatures so far which in turn is causing ice caps to melt sea levels to rise and has been linked to extreme droughts and storms we need to have technologies which allow us to have a high standard of living while being in carbon balances and we have done it with clean air in this country and I think we can also do it with stopping climate change cleaning up our existing nests is going to be hard expensive and controversial but it's also going to be necessary fortunately some people are already figuring out how we'll do it Klaus Lackner and his colleagues want us to rethink our relationship with carbon dioxide here at Arizona State University's Center for negative carbon emissions they see it as a waste management problem this is like sewage this is like garbage and you cannot just dump it in the atmosphere and I'll give you an example if I were to dump my garbage in the street in front of my house got my neighborhood you would object and you wouldn't think it was all that cool on my part to come back to you the next day and say I internally improved my efficiencies and I'm happy to announce that I'm only dumping 80% of what I used to dump into the street you would say clean up that mess and get rid of it right now technologies already exist to capture co2 at large emitters like the smokestacks of power plants but for the co2 already in our atmosphere Lackner is working on a technology to actually suck co2 out of the sky he started his research by looking at a device that already does this pretty well in a way it all started with trees right the question is can you pull co2 out of the atmosphere and you look at a tree and the answer is yes you can he wants to make a synthetic version that works even better certainly you can pull up plow over the horse but you're better off getting a tractor this is his tractor Lackner steam has been working on different versions of this technology for more than a decade the key component is this papery material which is embedded with a resin that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air our take on this material and our twist and our discovery is that it also has a strong affinity for carbon dioxide especially when it's in a dry state now I have sort of a spoon I can grab the co2 of it crucially the material also lets go of co2 dunk it in water or expose it to high humidity and it releases the carbon dioxide for collection it can be pumped underground fed to greenhouses or to algae for biofuel or perhaps in the future even used to make carbon-based materials once the co2 is gone you can dry the membrane in the air and reuse it Lackner expects the material will work for thousands of cycles this particular piece of material is probably 10 years old and it's working just fine right now the lab is working on different designs to maximize the materials contact with air so this was just the material run through a pasta maker kind of thing that rug in there was literally woven by some poor undergrads this was a bit of a reality check to see if in fact this accordion idea would work and in fact it does black nurse data suggests the material soundly beats nature and capturing carbon from the atmosphere you have an object the size of this tree made out of our material we roughly collect a thousand times as much co2 we in a given amount of time to suck up the amount of co2 humans are currently emitting would require a massive number of synthetic trees and that's the scale of cleanup Lackner is interested in this is the mock-up Lackner and his colleagues created to show what their device would look like if implemented on a large scale and fits into a standard shipping container and if you wanted to balance current emissions you would need a hundred million containers that's not a small footprint it's not a quick fix and the technology isn't cheap but neither were solar panels and windmills when they were first developed on an optimistic note when I started this in 1995 people just thought is crazy even to work on it and that that has changed dramatically critics of this technology argued that the ability to scrub co2 from the atmosphere might weaken our will to stop using fossil fuels but the damage has already been done and it needs fixing sooner rather than later we have done it on ozone we have done it on rivers yeah we have the same thing and it's only a question of how much does it have to hurt before we make this step the danger is by the time it hurts it's too late blocking out the Sun sounds like the plot of a Bond villain but for David Keith a physicist at Harvard University it's not a plot to destroy the planet it's about to save it Keith is researching solar geoengineering that's the proposal to spray tiny reflective particles into the upper atmosphere bouncing sunlight back into space and lowering global temperatures this technology might be able to quickly cool the earth if things get devastatingly humped I don't think we know enough now to say that we should do it I think in fact it would be lunacy to argue that we should start right now but what I do think is there's enough evidence that it could have enormous benefits benefits in many cases to the poorest and most vulnerable the old the world will be most affected by climate change that we ought to have a serious research program but we don't China does and there are some research programs in Europe but in America just advocating for geoengineering research is very controversial the kind of official u.s. position is ignorance which is really disturbing people on the side of the community will say it's reckless to research this or talk about it because it will weaken the political force to cut emissions and I think that really misconceives the job of science if we actually think these technologies can reduce risks it's our duty to say so obviously it's impossible to get approval in the u.s. to inject particles into the stratosphere to measure what happens so keeps lab is built a tiny atmosphere of its bone for testing specifically the glass tube that you see in here is a simulation of the stratosphere we can simulate these very cold temperatures in the stratosphere we can also put UV lamps around this that simulate the sunlight conditions in the stratosphere the goal is to find materials that can effectively reflect light while not damaging the atmosphere we will look at Diamond dust as one of the potential candidates yes it is the diamonds in the sky experiment the leap from lab experiment to deploying this worldwide is a large one and that's not lost on Keith no amount of research on this technology will remove the uncertainties the fact is we've put now for a hundred years an enormous amount of co2 in the atmosphere and we still don't know the climate's response to co2 accurate because the climate is a noisy beast if we engineering the Earth's atmosphere sounds a bit extreme to you you're not alone even though we accidentally messed up the climate some feel fixing it by deliberately manipulating the climate could have unknown consequences ones worse than our current problem it's a deep question why people seem to be more concerned about deliberate tinkering that actually aims to reduce environmental risks then they are about all sorts of hideous ways we damage the environment Solar geoengineering would work quickly and cheaply but it's not a permanent solution it addresses the symptoms of climate change not the causes but if our efforts to cut carbon emissions don't work fast enough it may be our only option I think it's very fair to think of this as a bad date or a kludge but band-aids aren't a bad thing if you're wounded you want band-aids it's something that is imperfect that doesn't deal with a root cause but might substantially reduce the risks you""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

play 48 minutes in business it's 24 by 7 by 365 and the whole world's trying to kick your ass I will never forget talking to mark about you know where are you going with this broadcast thing and he goes I'm going to the BBC billionaire boys club Mark Cuban parlayed his passion for Indiana basketball into a company worth five point seven billion dollars the day that broadcast.com was sold to Yahoo I think a lot of folks felt like we had hit the lottery twice the unorthodox entrepreneur has disrupted every business he touched he said never blow the stuff this is not what I want rip everything I always start again he's been slammed eliminated and investigated Mark Cuban order to appear before the SEC but almost always comes out on top he is smart being one of the smartest people but he goes ooh you could make the argument it was one of the luckiest people in the age of the Internet somebody has got to be the luckiest person in the world nobody's got it it appears that they are facility game-by-game basis but I can't feel - Mark Cuban got in at the beginning of the internet boom and it served him well his gold mine was called broadcast comm one of the first internet sites to stream events live everything from Victoria's Secret models to countless sporting events we were the first ones to scale internet broadcasting you know to take five hundred radio stations and broadcast them on the Internet a hundred television stations earnings calls product launches college football games deals with the NHL Major League Baseball mean we had really become a broadcast network on the Internet the fiercely independent entrepreneur has blazed a trail into TV movies NBA ownership and he even stars on a TV show though he declined to participate in this one mark has been an entrepreneur from the moment the word was invented before it meant drug deal Mark Cuban was born in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and grew up in a suburb called Mount Lebanon from the get-go Cuban was a money maker selling trash bags newspapers and even postage stamps I started a stamp company I started with a quarter and bought a stamp and left with $50 thinking hey if I could do this I could do anything by the time he was 16 he had already built a reputation Brian Cuban is his younger brother I remember mark being given $5,000 by one of our neighbors to go buy stamps in New York with my father now he was always the entrepreneur a stamp shows but that just shows you at that age what people thought of his ability to make money that skill only grew at Indiana University the tireless business major taught disco started a chain letter and decided to run a bar if he could come up with $15,000 Evan Williams was an engineer at General Motors who played on the school rugby club with Mark Cuban he was at my house one day he was calling banks to try to get a loan so I could buy this bar so on my way out said hey mark if you have any problems getting that loan just give me a call two days later he goes hey EV so I ended up late 1979 loaning mark fifteen thousand dollars so he could buy a bar in Bloomington Kuban awarded Williams stock certificate number one and within months opened his bar Motley's Wayne Winston teaches graduate statistics at Indiana University in my over 35 years of teaching I've never had a student really start a business while they were an undergrad or an MBA here on campus and he started Motley's which became by far I think the best bar in town the business model he used in Motley's is very close to the same business models he used in his next two or three businesses he always would have 51% of it even though he didn't put up any of his own money but no one really complained because he was the one that built up the business until it came crashing down after a wet t-shirt contest it's pretty common knowledge around town and underage girl won a wet t-shirt contest and so I think that hurt the future of the bar let's put it that way Kuban graduated and soon landed in Dallas within a year the born entrepreneur launched micro solutions providing software hardware and training to businesses at the dawn of the PC revolution it was a family affair Marko's you come work for me so I said fine so my first day at work you're not a big lawyer I show up with my suit and tie and he goes why are you wearing that well you know come to work for you at micro solutions no go home and change put on crappy clothes and your jeans you're in the stockroom mark doesn't give you anything you have to learn it and earn it Mark Cuban learned the computer business fast and in seven years sold his company to CompuServe for six million dollars I retired and you retired and what did you do with that money your biggest purchase my biggest purchase I bought a lifetime pass on American Airlines and I had one mission in mind I wanted to be already go to as many countries around the world as I could and get drunk with as many people as I possibly could and I was so good in 1995 Mark Cuban came out of early retirement to reinvent radio according to Cuban college friend Todd Wagner brought him the concept it's a story that Hoosiers basketball fan has told often as in this interview on 60 minutes he sat me down he said look I've got this idea where I think we can listen to Indiana basketball sporting events you know anywhere in the world by using the Internet so mark and I just basically said let's find out if this is a business or not so we set up shop in his upstairs bedroom of his house and you know got us a computer got the software and started playing with it and that is the birth of audio net what eventually became broadcast comm but another young entrepreneur tells a different story Chris jabe says he was also a founder of the company when I was pretty young I was a Minnesota Twins fan I moved to Texas oh it's a displaced fan I was always trying to figure out how to get access to those games that I couldn't see on regular TV when the internet came along it's like it was a slam dunk because now it was just a matter of querying broadcast rights he took his plan to investors one of them was Cuban I probably had this pitch dyed given to maybe 150 people over the previous year and a half to two years and so I'm getting into my pitch this shoots about a 20-minute pitch and within three minutes he goes I'm in I'll do it Jeb asked for a million dollars and said that Cuban wrote a check for 10,000 and months later tried to cut him out completely mark said Chris I really don't need you you really don't have that much to add I can pretty much do or get people to do what you're doing so I was a little bummed to say the least and I really give Todd a lot of credit when he came to me and said you know we can work a deal with you know for 2,500 a month and 10% of the company in the way he described it in the Ray he showed me the paperwork I knew it was real and it really made me feel really good actually even though it was hard to take 10% of a company that I developed 100% from scratch cuban became the driving force of audio net mark overall really wanted to see it as his company he had made it gone from really idea to reality he never really want to acknowledge me as a founder but co-founder Todd Wagner does acknowledge Jeb's participation he was there for a very brief period of time and then he went on to the next thing he owned the slug of equity and did just fine audio net did better than just fine you go back in there and all they did was have all these servers with all these different sporting events going on and people trying to keep the server's up virtually what is going on in here they're planning a nuclear strike you know but it was controlled chaos and they're keeping all those servers up and all the game streaming it was pretty cool Kuban and Wagner changed the name from audio net to broadcast comm in 1998 and positioned the company to go public the internet boom was in full swing and on July 17th the stock hit the market priced at $18 a share the first trade pops up and it was you know $63 or whatever it was I mean it was just through the roof nada Oh Cena led the sports properties and marketing departments at the company I recall our head of HR popping her head out of a cube like a game of whack-a-mole and saying we opened at whatever the number was and everyone looked up and we thought she missed by a decimal she must be wrong and we all started a look and you could just see heads popping out and the excitement in the room it was literally like a parade went off the stock closed at 60 to 75 at the time it's set a record for the highest percentage increase on an opening day I'm the first to realize that luck plays a huge part in it I happen to have a company broadcast comm that went public at the right time when the internet stock market was going nuts Cuban wanted to expand their content and was looking for a breakout event he founded in lingerie there were a lot of pinnacle events for broadcast comm and one of those was certainly the Victoria's Secret webcast rapping high-tech with high-fashion the webcast was a phenomenon millions of people tuned in and it became the largest viewed event ever on the web we like to position it as the first sold-out event on the Internet it helped to cement us as the go-to place if you wanted to do something multimedia on the Internet Jeff Sweeney is an entrepreneur and friend of Cubans from Dallas I will never forget talking to Marc about you know where are you going with this broadcast thing and he goes I'm going to the BBC billionaire boys club you're not gonna make a billion dollars on this thing I mean you're gonna make one hundred million dollars no no no dude no BBC dude that's what I'm doing in pursuit of that billion Cuban and Wagner led the charge straight to the executive offices of Yahoo I remember mark and I going into the conference room and basically just saying look we're where you guys need to be so you're either gonna have to compete with us or you're gonna have to buy us because we are big players in what we think the Internet's gonna go Yahoo felt the breadth of competition according to Paul Sappho a leading technology forecaster it's a moment where there's a sense of the rise of the machines algorithms the form of Google are really taking over the search space and it's beginning to dawn on people that in fact there is a lot of volatility and customer loyalty around place as you visit on the web I can remember going to Yahoo and you could just feel the anxiety at the company how do we bulk up our technology side looking for an answer in April 1999 Yahoo grabbed broadcast.com for a staggering sum 5.7 billion dollars in stock the deal secured Cubans membership in that billionaires Club I think a lot of folks felt like we had hit the lottery twice you had this tremendous IPO and to top it off one of the the great companies in Silicon Valley Yahoo comes in and acquires this little old company that was set up in Deep Ellum Dallas Texas it couldn't have been frankly scripted any better but not scripted all that well for Yahoo it is so easy to quarterback this thing and as people say it's one of the stupidest moves in the history of the internet but there was so much stupidity in that period it was like a single note in a vast symphony of stupidity yahoo struggled with their new acquisition it's pretty simple to see what happened if you're on the inside you had a five billion dollar acquisition handed to a number of NBA's who had never actually integrated anything before we ah who really took a pounding they took their eye off the ball of search which opened the door for Google who smoked them within months of the buyout Kuban protected a stock by buying puts and calls against his interest and began to cash out buying a twenty four thousand square foot mansion and a forty 1 million dollar jet but his next purchase would be the billionaire's prized possession you in January 2000 sports fanatic Mark Cuban bought majority ownership in the Dallas Mavericks from Ross Perot jr. it was the crowning purchase for the billionaire with the insatiable desire to win except that the franchise had one of the worst win-loss records of any team in the NBA you've gotta start giving these guys who have been in damage programs let's call him the thought process that they can win that they are expected to win Cuban was going to change everything his way terr Dima Ussery the buttoned-up CEO of the Dallas Mavericks recalled his first meeting I didn't need the whole day because we're having dinner at his house that night and I want to be a great guest and I was in suit and tie and you know tell my Sunday best is my mom called it he opened doors and jeans and no shoes him t-shirt and we sat on this floor and watch basketball for four or five hours and eight I think anything was cocoa puffs and Doritos is what we had in bottled waters so it was it was just a new reality that new reality took effect the moment Cubans saw the traditional wood paneled locker room in the Mavericks new arena he said you've got to blow this up this is not what I want I want a law of come on open ceilings I want the guys to fly kits a clubhouse the place they hang out and we got to get a pool table in here and we got to get the DVDs rip everything out and start again in the clubhouse the radical new owner booked first-class hotels for road games and went by a team jet with legroom for seven footers all that stuff was noon none of that stuff had been done in the league before nor had an owner worn a Mavs fan for life t-shirt or put his email address on the jumbotron or broken custom by ditching the skybox for courtside seats and yelling at the referees mark is the plenty that's gotten him in trouble Scot sosnick reports on sports business for Bloomberg News my favorite one is when he said that a referee wasn't qualified to manage a Dairy Queen but when he said that Dairy Queen got upset but they wanted mark to know what their managers were highly trained highly skilled folks and so the guy challenged mark to come down and serve ice cream and to see how difficult it really was there were probably six helicopters hovering above at this poor Dairy Queen there were probably 3,000 people outside and he was there additional ice cream he's a very very smart marketing guy and if he can turn a negative into a positive he will but Cubans courtside criticism was a negative for David Stern the longtime Commissioner of the NBA I think mark was very impatient when he first became an owner because he strives for perfection and he expressed his views in that regard it wasn't a constructive enterprise to publicly criticize our officials and it's prohibited by our rules those rules resulted in Cubans first fine of $5,000 followed by fines of 15,000 25,000 250,000 100,000 10,000 and 100,000 again all in his first full season as an owner my job is to stand up for my my guys enough I think something's wrong I'm gonna do something about it reporter John Swartz followed Cubans career for 13 years that connects with people you don't see that among many billionaires they think they have to act a certain way now that he cares I think you honestly just could give a damn what anyone thinks about him Cubans hands-on involvement brought immediate success attendance shot up more than 35% the estimated teen value left fifty million dollars and the Mavericks went to the playoffs in 2001 for the first time in over ten years before he owned the Dallas Mavericks they were the laughingstock of the NBA they were winning 15 games a year once he took over their winning percentages got to be one of the best it's done being the top five despite their surging success that year the Mavericks fell short of the championship and success for Cuban in the film and TV business was also proving elusive at the dawn of HDTV in 2001 he launched the first high-definition television network called HD net as he explained to Charlie Rose we're available on cable were available on satellite but viewers can go knowing that not only they're gonna get great entertainment but they're gonna get great entertainment and the best possible picture quality the network sputtered barely reaching 350,000 homes in its first year Cuban hit pause long enough to marry longtime girlfriend Tiffany Stewart throwing a reception bash on his home court the American Airlines Center by 2003 he reteamed with Todd Wagner and plunged into the movie business we bought Landmark Theatres which was a national independent theater chain we invested and then bought Magnolia Pictures a theatrical distribution company we built on a home entertainment unit as well to that and all of a sudden we had built a vertically integrated media company meaning with production distribution and exhibition all under one roof in a way that frankly we had not seen done before it gave Cuban the pieces to shake up the movie business by releasing a film in theaters on DVD and TV simultaneously Andy fix mer is an entertainment reporter for Bloomberg News back then nobody was doing this nobody even thought that you would dare put a movie on television before it was released in theaters it just wasn't done Cubans movies met with mixed success some films like good night and good luck had found critical acclaim and a niche audience while others struggled and there was a disappointment again on the basketball court star Dirk Nowitzki led the team into the finals in 2006 the Mavs were up two games to none when momentum suddenly shifted and the team dropped three straight Cuban was livid when he was pissed he may as well have been Satan the players literally ran the other way in the locker room after their collapse in the championship Nowitzki publicly called for Cuban to control his temper for the owner who hated to lose the loss was pure devastation I believe he didn't leave the house for three weeks and he became a shut-in so what did it cost him it cost him his dream really his dream was to turn the Mavericks into Champions Mark Cuban the former disco teacher returned to dancing in 2007 in front of millions mark likes as much air time as he can get as long as it's fun and it's entertainment for him he's going to do it he appeared on almost anything even hosting his own reality show the benefactor canceled after one season viewers were also in short supply on his own network with it's strange blend of bikini themed programming mixed martial arts and dan Rather dan Rather and Dan Rather reports on HDNet is kind of my own personal indulgence you know I'm a news junky and always have been dan Rather was doing his show for them which was actually very good but the rest of it was just like a Sargasso Sea of just crap Cuban had more troubles looming the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit against him we return now to the crackdown on insider trading and it has ensnared billionaire the SEC alleged that Cuban dumped 600,000 shares of mama calm as an insider trade the 2008 lawsuit from the SEC says he sold shares the company ahead of the company's own plans to sell more discounted shares to investors and avoided three-quarters of a million dollars worth of losses on his blog Cuban stated the claims were false the suit was dismissed in District Court but the SEC appealed and the case was reinstated in 2010 while Cuban battled in the courtroom he also prepared for battle on the basketball court he dealt for key players hired a new coach and in 2011 the Mavericks fought their way back to the fighters surprising everyone the loudmouth behind the team bench went silent it was different I mean still people went up and talked to him but he said not today not me talk to the players with Mark in the background it was this other guy Dirk Nowitzki and the team that Mark had assembled that in the end was able to live off what he's always dreamed of we've had the ceremony inside the building and all of a sudden chant broke out thank you Mark thank you Mark thank you mark how many times have you heard of a building chanting thank you to the owner that's pretty unique with a championship banner finally in place Cuban rebranded HDNet calling it access TV in addition to Ryan Seacrest Cuban partnered with two of the most powerful names in music and entertainment he lives in Dallas with his wife and three children on his personal blog he sounds off on everything from executive compensation to personal health weather brilliant are just plain lucky Mark Cuban will always be looking for his next big move is going to challenge conventions he's gonna change how people think he's definitely a guy to always keep your eye on he's brash he's not afraid of controversy but he's also one of the most brilliant strategic thinkers I've ever met is the glass of water half-full or half-empty Mark's gonna be the guy asking whose porn you can look at things and say this is the way they've always been done I like to look at and said well if everybody's doing this way that's not where the future is you have to look somewhere else and you know if that pisses people off that's their problem""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,0,Inside the Lab That Could Solve the World's Plastics Problem (Unsolvable: Episode 1),"June 7 -- Plastics are everywhere in our lives, but those bottles, utensils, and electronics can take hundreds of years to decompose. Since the material is too useful to abandon, we're faced with two problems: how can we develop environmentally friendly products, and how do we clean up the plastics we've already discarded? We travel to a materials lab in Minnesota and a recycling plant in California to find the answers in this episode of Unsolvable.Watch more from Bloomberg's 'Unsolvable' series: http://bloom.bg/2aRBuPZLike this video?

plastics are amazing materials they're lightweight but strong flexible but impermeable they're in our cars planes hospitals weapons and electronics plastic is everywhere but of course that's the problem plastic is everywhere more importantly plastics don't biodegrade that water bottle you use for ten minutes it could take 500 years or more to fully decomposed most plastics that we use are single-use short time use packaging and then they're discarded that mismatch between plastics short use and long life results in an overflow of plastic waste think about how crazy this is to get the raw materials for plastics we spend billions pulling fossil fuels out of the earth then we pollute the earth to make plastics and then we toss those plastics right back into the ground where they came from I think 50 years from now what will happen is people will be digging out land fields and taking out product to recycle and they will think we were crazy people of dumping things in landfills so we should just get rid of plastic small problem there is nothing better at doing what plastic does than plastic when it comes to its low cost versatility and durability the plastic we use today is unbeatable we're not going to get rid of plastics anytime soon so we better deal with them in a more intelligent way from where they come from and also where they go after we're done using them that means two things we have to develop new environmentally friendly materials that can replace petroleum-based plastics and we have to find a way to clean up the plastics we've already discarded one of the team's that's developing a sustainable replacement for plastic is here in this lab at the Center for sustainable polymers at the University of Minnesota the majority of plastics that we use now are from petroleum and by majority I mean more than 90 percent maybe more than 95 but the team at this lab is trying to change that they are trying to totally rethink where a plastic can come from could you make a plastic of living materials like plants or bacteria one of the common misconceptions in the world of plastic is that there's plastic well actually there's several different varieties of plastic you familiar with recycling symbols there's seven of those so there's no one plastic that will replace all plastics at the lab researchers are working on several types of bio plastics that's plastic made out of renewable resources that could be used for everything from the soles of shoes to housing insulation the latest breakthrough is a new type of foam that could replace petroleum-based cushioning like what's in car seats and bedding and it all starts with bacteria it's eco life its STD check life so that's the strain that we use for our experiments the e.coli is genetically modified meaning it's given a new set of instructions in this case to synthesize molecules that can be polymerized to create new materials then they're fed sugar shaken and fermented the byproduct of this process is a molecule that's a precursor to plastic when mixed with a catalyst in the lab the chemical reaction produces this bubbling gel-like substance when it hardens you've got foam so it's still pretty sticky but this can then be cut and thrown into pillows the main reason that I think this is important is because the feedstock is renewable there's an endless supply of bacteria and sugar a far cry from petroleum which is limited in supply and expensive to find so that's where the foam comes from but what happens when it's time to throw it away when you're ready to get rid of that car seat or pillow most phones aren't recycled and if they are they're chopped up and broken into a degraded material but if this foam is collected it can be chemically broken back down into the same precursor they started with which can then be used to create new foams over and over again the lab is also working on a replacement for rubber in things like shoes tires sporting equipment or household items so we want to look for rubbery materials things that are stretchy that are elastic that can be extended and they snap right back this process starts with starch from corn chemists can synthesize the polymer in the lab dry it and then mold it once we form some of the rubbers that we use today we can't reprocess them they can just be ground up and make the playground rubber material but this you can melt and reprocess and reuse it and it's compostable that's what we strive for right because we don't want to have our ocean filled with process so why aren't materials like this in all of our couches and shoes already so I oftentimes joke that my lab has produced a lot of materials that have interesting and exciting properties but nobody really cares about him that's because the bio plastics in this lab are still relatively expensive to produce especially now with oil prices so low the unfortunate reality is that consumers like you will not pay a premium for bio renewability or degradability they're not much of a premium an ideal bioplastic would not only look and perform as well as petroleum-based plastics it would be just as cheap and easy to produce it probably won't look any different I'll still grab the bag to put my fruit at the grocery store except it'll be from bio-based feedstocks and except when I throw it away it'll have a facile route to decomposition to give environmentally innocuous byproducts if this lab succeeds a better world might look a lot like the one we already live in bio plastics may be a few years out but there are steps we can take today to help clean up the plastic we've already used we're at carbon light industries in Riverside California it's a plastics recycling plant one that specializes in recycling a type of plastic called PE tea that you find in most soda and water bottles every day 300,000 pounds of plastic bottles arrive in bales that's 3 billion bottles a year they're sent through a maze of high-tech machines that sort clean melt and sanitize them it's what you think of when you think of a recycling plant except carbon light does something few recyclers are actually able to do turn plastic bottles back into material for new plastic bottles this is Leon Ferran ik founder and CEO of carbon light by the way Leon's been in plastics for a long time he ran one of the first companies that introduced plastic bags to grocery stores in the 80s I feel that ok I brought grocery sacks and all that now I'm what do you call it redeeming myself and I'm doing recycling until recently most plastic bottles collected for recycling in the US were sent overseas a lot of the bottles that was collected in California for example or other places were being shipped to China so what the Chinese would do take the bottles transform it into a lesser material like a carpet like fabric and then ship it back to us bottle to bottle like what we do that we call it cradle to cradle that that happens a lot less what most people don't realize is when they throw a plastic water bottle into a blue or green recycling bin that bottles less likely to become another bottle than it is to become something else like carpet or teddy bear stuffing and if it winds up living a second life as carpeting or teddy bear stuffing then it more than likely ends it's recyclable life there that's because those materials are harder to collect and recycle why not just turn old plastic bottles into new ones well it's expensive and you have to have a very sophisticated facility like this one to be able to make the necessary material for people to use it for their beverages Jeff Walsh vice president of operations took us around to show us the inner workings ok so this is where the process starts one of these bales weighs about 1300 pounds or so first bottles are broken out of bales trash and non PE tea materials are separated using optical sorters then a rinse cycle begins to remove labels and camps colored and clear materials are separated then they get crushed and hot washed finally the bottles are ground into what carbon light calls cornflake the last step is melting the flake and cutting it into beads Jose VA is the Quality Control Manager at the on-site lab we operate 24 hours a day seven days a week and our sole purpose is to test the lab tests the product to make sure it meets manufacturer's standards for safety and structural integrity with the most recent dip in oil prices Ferran ik says plastics derived from petroleum are currently cheaper than carbon lights recycled material even so customers like Nestle and Pepsi still buy carbon light's product to use in some of their bottles after all who doesn't like to see an earth-friendly logo on their 15 ounces of acai machine this is our problem it will be ashame to 50 years from now people are suffering this is right for the environment it's really a huge issue and we have to take care of it""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,0,How Boeing Lost Its Way,"Boeing is an American institution. But one year after the grounding of the 737 Max, the company's stock has fallen by almost 50% and its future is anything but certain. So what were Boeing's failures in the aftermath of two tragedies in which the flawed plane crashed, killing 346 people, and can Boeing regain its elite status in U.S. aviation once more?#Boeing #Aviation #Transportation--------Like this video?

Rescuers have located debris, but they do not expect\nto find any survivors. Some of the warning signs, in retrospect were there all along. Some of the decisions, or changes, were so subtle that people\nmight not even have realized the importance, as they were taking place. And Ethiopian Airlines flight has crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing\nall 157 passengers and crew thought to be on board. Boeing\'s best-selling plane is coming under increased scrutiny after another deadly accident. We\'ll do everything\npossible to earn and re-earn that trust and confidence from our customers and the flying public in the weeks and months ahead. Boeing is an American icon, revered around the world for\nits engineering innovation. But with two crashes in under six months, critics have asked if Boeing is straying from its original mission. The SEC is investigating whether Boeing properly disclosed issues\ntied to the grounding of its 737 Max Airliners. One message described the 737 Max as a plane designed by\nclowns, overseen by monkeys. The safety culture at Boeing was corrupted under pressure from Wall Street, and executives, and board members who were lookin\' more at their bonuses than they were at the\nintegrity of the organization. Boeing was playing a\ngame, to a certain extent. It was a game of numbers. They were meeting Wall\nStreet\'s expectations, but unfortunately, that came at the expense of the end\ncustomer, and the flying public. The failures that happened at Boeing are really complicated,\nand involve subtle forces and cultural changes\nthat have been underway for decades at the company. This is a story of how an American icon lost its way, and whether or not it can find it again. 2019 was not the best year for Boeing. Just five months apart, two\nBoeing 737 Max planes crashed, and the planes have been\ngrounded since March of 2019. There\'s simply no precedent, in aviation, for a plane this important\nto be grounded this long. In the first crash, Lion air flight 610, something was discovered with\nthe technology on the plane. Investigators believe the plane\'s sensors or its computers, had bad data\nsuggesting a potential stall. There was this software system, known as MCAST, that stands for maneuvering characteristics\naugmentation system. This obscure flight control software was created so the Max handled\nthe same way for pilots as the previous generation of 737s. Black box data indicated that a bad sensor had triggered MCAST, which automatically pushed the plane down. Within probably 24 hours\nof them discovering this, Boeing and the FAA put out a warning, indicating that this could occur, and then also telling\nthem how to counteract it. There is a fix, simply flipping a switch should have turned the\nautomatic system off. The second crash,\nhowever, the same failure. I\'ve covered dozens and\ndozens of plane crashes, and one of my mantras has always been that crashes don\'t occur\nfor the same cause. China grounded the plane, and it just set off a ripple effect. Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination,\nand thereafter be grounded. Boeing is an incredible company, and hopefully they\'ll very\nquickly come up with the answer. What had been billed as a relatively simple software\nfix proved not to be so simple. Every time it seemed like Boeing\nwas just around the corner, then a new issue cropped up. MCAST wasn\'t the only\nissue on this airplane, you had issues where the computers were getting overloaded with information, now there\'s a new issue that the computers don\'t start up properly, when you want them to. And then, the first batch of really embarrassing\nemployee emails leaked. The FAA is demanding answers from Boeing after they waited months\nto disclose to the agency internal messages between test pilots who were working in the\n737 Max flight simulator. ""It\'s running rampant in the sim on me."" One pilot, referencing\nthe flight simulator. ""The plane is trimming itself like crazy."" The emails came out two weeks before Boeing\'s Chief Executive,\nDennis Muilenburg, was due to testify before Congress, and it was a bipartisan shellacking. 346 people are dead because what these chief\npilots describe as egregious. You\'re the CEO, the buck stops with you, did you read this document, and how did your team not\nput it in front of you, run in with their hair on fire, sayin\' \'We got a real problem here.\' Ultimately, we don\'t quite know exactly what caused the MCAST design, just like we don\'t know all\nthe causes of the crash, we don\'t quite know, but it\'s very clear that the one big cultural change at Boeing had been a disruption in the communication between engineers and top management. But this kind of cultural change for a company as old as\nBoeing happens slowly, over the course of not years, but decades. Boeing\'s history goes back over a century, and while its early sea\nplanes weren\'t iconic, by World War Two, their\nmilitary aircraft were. When news of the successful raid by the Flying Fortresses comes in, these are the people who\nget the biggest thrill, the thousands of Boeing\nworkers who build them. Boeing\'s an American manufacturing icon. It was churning out bombers that were critical to the\nallied defense effort, and gave us Rosie the Riveter. Sort of a symbol for\nAmerican can-do culture. Employers find that women can do many jobs as well as\nmen, some jobs better. They were the great survivors\nof the post-World War Two shakedown in aircraft design, and the most successful new entrant in the new jetliner\nmarket of the late 1950s. The company gambled\neverything on a prototype of what became its first\njetliner, the Boeing 707. Nearing completion in the Boeing plant at Seattle, America\'s first jet transport is a unit of glistening beauty. And that was followed by the 727, and built this revolutionary\nbehemoth, the 747, you probably know it for\nthe hump behind the nose, and at the same time, they\ncame up with what became Boeing\'s greatest commercial success, and that was the 737. The 737 wasn\'t immediately successful. It took several design\nand engineering iterations to turn it into the\nplane that we see today. It became a work horse for\nairlines like Southwest, that fly primarily shorter routes, and really brought travel\nto every day people. And even as more and more travelers flew on these aircraft, the aviation safety\nrecord during this time made flying one of the\nstatistically safest ways to travel. We\'ve been the technology\nleader in aviation in the world. Boeing was a magnificent company, who made, in my opinion, the\nbest airplanes in the world, until some of these\nrecent cultural changes, which all came from\npressure to Wall Street, and bad management. You know, over the years, Boeing was this tremendously important and innovative company, but it wasn\'t necessarily a great stock. In 1997, Boeing merged\nwith McDonnell Douglas, another aerospace and defense giant. Boeing said \'let\'s do a merger, we\'ll\ncontinue with the innovation, \'and maybe McDonnell Douglas will help us \'in terms of our structure \'and telling our story to Wall Street.\' Almost immediately you began to hear kind of a bitter joke\ncoming out of Seattle, that McDonnell Douglas had used Boeing\'s money to buy Boeing, and certainly, in terms\nof management structure, it began to look that way. Harry Stonecipher, a former GE executive and McDonnell Douglas CEO, becomes COO of the combined companies. And more and more of the\ncompany\'s style and culture began to be more of a McDonnell\nDouglas sort of picture. He almost immediately signaled there was a new sheriff in town, and he was gonna bring\nfinancial disciple to Boeing. Stonecipher would eventually become CEO, and continued his emphasis on controlling costs within the company. A culture that engineers\nwithin the company would begin to feel. We had breakfast with\nthe president of the-- This is Stan Sorscher, he was a physicist at\nBoeing for over 20 years, and felt these changes firsthand. And he said he was so proud of cutting his capital expenditure budgets by 60%. Capital expenditures, for us, were improvements in the\nfactory, in our shop floor, in processes and materials\nand things like that. By 2000, there was a great\ndeal of dissatisfaction with the way our problem solving culture\nwas being displaced, and we thought it was\njust much more difficult for us to do our job. And that\'s when a lot of people trace this sort of fundamental shift in thinking in terms of what you prioritize, whether that be profits, or\nwhether that be engineering. Further evidence of a move away from engineering prowess and innovation, to profit,\nwas Boeing\'s decision to move company headquarters to Chicago, when Boeing\'s jet manufacturing and airplane designers were in Seattle. Probably the biggest motivation was to send a message to the Street that this was a company\nthat was not going to make investment decisions\non the basis of legacy, or heritage, or anything like that, but rather, purely make\ninvestment decisions on the basis of returns, and by moving to a place\nwhere there were no legacy loyalties, no heritage\nproduction facilities, they were sending that message. And it also started to shape how Boeing viewed its own internal investments in things like airplane programs, tremendously important as the company started planning for what\nbecame the 787 Dreamliner. Ladies and gentlemen, your 787 Dreamliner. For this event, it was held\non July 8, 2007, so 787, Tom Brokaw was there, I was there just sitting in the audience, just trying to soak it all in. I think they raised the factory door, and there was the plane. But at the time, it was\njust, it was an empty shell. We didn\'t know it, but it\nwas all for appearances. For the 787, Boeing attempted a new system for designing the aircraft. Instead of doing everything in house, it would outsource much of the plane\'s design and manufacturing\nto its biggest suppliers. It was gonna be about outsourcing, outsourcing to the places where we could produce things more cheaply, as opposed to the finest, best, safest airplanes in the world, which is what Boeing made for decades. This works for running\nshoes, ladies garments, cell phones, hard drives,\nintegrated circuits, it works for everybody, it\'ll\nwork for you, and I thought \'No, it won\'t.\' Boeing had never done a plane\nusing the system before, this was very different from Boeing controlling the processes itself, and it did not go well. We launched the 787, the\nworst I could think of was that we\'d be three months late, which is a shooting offense at Boeing. It wasn\'t three months late,\nit was three years late, it wasn\'t 5 billion dollars over budget, it was 30 or 40 or 50\nbillion dollars over budget. Grounded the fleet for three months. The suppliers were just\nin over their heads, most of them, we had years of issues, there was an engine\nexplosion at one point, there was an electrical fire\non flight test aircraft. And I thought \'Okay, this experiment is done.\' This didn\'t work. And the executive said \'The business model is fine,\nwe just didn\'t execute it.\' Every new airplane has growing pains, especially those that kind of push the edge of the\nenvelope in technology. Eventually, Boeing would fix many of the 787\'s issues, and the Dreamliner slowly\nstarted to bring in big returns, and with a profitable plane, Boeing looked at other measures to boost its returns to shareholders. There\'s different ways of\ngetting your profit up, so one is just that you make\nthe best product imaginable, and everybody wants to buy it, and so your sales go up, and you make more money on that plane. The other is that you do\nfinancial engineering. One common technique for companies to boost their stock price is a practice known as stock buybacks, where a company uses its capital to buy back its own stock\nfrom the marketplace. And the math is really\nsimple to understand, if you have fewer shares\ntrading, absent all else, the price goes up, the shares worth more, they get a nice return\non their investment. Boeing\'s stock was on the rise, and by 2015, new CEO Dennis Muilenburg would ramp the program up even more. From 2014 to 2019,\nBoeing would re-purchase about 38 billion of its own shares. They went from a relatively\nnormal percentage, something like 30%, to over 90% of cash being returned to investors. And the contrast to pensions being cut was really shocking, and sort of a bitter\nmoment for some people. Buying back shares, and\npaying huge dividends, while you\'re laying off senior engineers to hire cheap labor in\nIndia, that\'s a sickness. But while long time employees at Boeing may have been frustrated, at the time, this was viewed as a huge success. In less than a decade, the\ncompany\'s stock price tripled. Wall Street just loved this\ncompany, its stock shot up. I see a new Boeing, I just\nsee just straight line growth. And Muilenburg was getting\nthe rockstar treatment. You\'re obviously a very\naccomplished executive, you\'ve done a great job for\nBoeing and its shareholders, I wish I had bought the\nstock when you took over. It\'s still a good deal.\nStill a good deal. Around the same time all\nof this was happening, Boeing was selling record\nnumbers of its newest plane, the 737 Max. The 737 Max was born out of\na competition with Airbus. The aviation industry is a duopoly between Boeing and Airbus, with the two giants controlling almost all of the jetliner market. For both companies, it\'s\nbeating commercial heart is an enormously profitable\nfamily of single-aisle jets, the Boeing 737, and Airbus A320. While Boeing had planned\nto build an all-new jet to replace the 737, it was sidetracked by\nthe Dreamliner debacle. Airbus shocked everyone by\nannouncing a simple upgrade to its A320 family of planes, in what became known as the A320 Neo. Since the new planes had engines that increased fuel efficiency and required no lengthy\ntraining for pilots to fly, it became a huge cost saver for airlines, and a big hit for Airbus. So Boeing had to do the same thing, if Boeing didn\'t act, or waited too long, they could lose significant market share. American Airlines called Boeing and said \'We\'re gonna buy 400 planes, \'and they will all be Airbus \'unless you can match their fuel economy, \'and the fact that no\npilot training is required, \'it\'s identical to their\nother Airbus models.\' And the Boeing CEO said \'No no no no, we\'ll match that, \'we want half that order.\' With the Max, Boeing\nwas also trying to shake the image of incompetence\nthat had followed the 787 debacle, so there was a lot of pressure there, to show that the, \'Hey, look, we can design planes, \'and we can meet deadlines with the Max.\' And to their credit,\nwith the Max, they did. Unfortunately for Boeing, some of the critical engineering\ndecisions that were made came back to haunt them. In late 2015, Boeing\'s first 737 Max takes\nshape, right on schedule. Flight testing begins in early 2016, and in 2017, the Max enters\nthe commercial market, months early, and it is, in fact, that fastest selling\naircraft in company history. You saw huge orders\ncoming for both companies, airlines seemed generally pleased with it, and to be honest, they still are. Even after the crisis, some\nof the biggest customers say \'You know what, this is a good airplane.\' But internal emails, made public from investigators, revealed that Boeing had gone\nto extraordinary measures to get the Max into the air, including some employees lying to the FAA. The Chief Technical Pilot on the plane described how he used Jedi\nmind tricks on regulators. In one exchange, a Boeing employee says ""I still haven\'t been forgiven by God ""for the covering up I did last year."" The most disturbing thing we\'ve found is, there was a 2013 meeting, and they conspired to conceal the system. MCAST was created so that the larger, more\nfuel-efficient engines on the Max wouldn\'t make the plane\nhandle any differently than the previous generation of 737s. At that meeting, they said \'Well wait a minute, wait a minute, \'if we tell anybody about this system, \'then they might require that \'pilots have additional training, \'and our bosses, from the top, in Boeing, \'and our contracts with the airlines say \'no additional training required, \'so we have to conceal this, \'no one outside Boeing can know \'that this safety-critical system exists.\' Another week, another shakeup at Boeing. The company\'s former\nCEO, Dennis Muilenburg, forced out after 35\nyears with the company, and four years as CEO. After firing Muilenburg, Boeing would close their books on one of the worst financial\nperformances in history, estimating 18.6 billion in total costs for the grounded 737 Max, and it would report its\nfirst annual loss since 1997. Dave Calhoun, a member of Boeing\'s board, was tapped as the next CEO, and immediately starts to make sweeping changes within the company. The first couple of weeks on the job, he moved very quickly to get\nany embarrassing overhang from the last year, just\nclean out the cobwebs, get all the bad news out there right now. Trying to be more transparent, Calhoun dumped even\nmore damning documents, and holds a conference\ncall with reporters. When boards reach a\nconclusion to change a CEO, they expect change. And they recognize the arguments that have been presented from\nthe outside world as legit, and they\'re gonna experience a different style of leadership, a different way of doin\' things. But it\'s unclear whether or not Calhoun will shift Boeing\'s priority\naway from pleasing Wall Street, and return the company\nto its engineering roots and heritage of creating\ntop flight planes. We believe this airplane\'s safer than the safest airplane flying today. Every next airplane has to be that way, it has to be that way for Boeing, it has to be that way for our competitors. He\'s been on the board since mid-2009, and also one of the, well, almost all of the board members that do not have an engineering degrees, from a purely accounting background, private equity, hedge\nfunds, that kind of thing. This is a bit strange,\nbecause on one level a company really needs to change. On the other hand, other\nthan a shareholder emergency, I\'m not really sure what would be the\ninstigator of that change. We are gonna have the most open book the world\'s ever seen, on this subject. Transparency is what we lost for a moment, and it\'s something we have to regain, because it speaks to the trust\nthat the world has in us. I am very hopeful that he can restore the safety culture there, so that they can focus\non making safe airplanes. The old days of simply harvesting cash from legacy programs, and returning it to\nshareholders, needs to stop, and the idea of engineers\nbeing some sort of a commodity that you can rely upon\nto come through for you, that needs to stop, too. The bigger issue of setting the tone, changing culture, which,\nthese things happen gradually, bit by bit, he\'s saying all\nthe right things right now, about correcting course, but we won\'t know for awhile as to whether Boeing\'s on the right course.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

guarantee with all of my assets his greatest asset is his ability to take this big big dream and make other people believe that it's true the determined engineers big dreams transformed three industries I'm just wishing through any entities that are listening please watch this launch and here's an immigrant from South Africa coming to America to save you know NASA that whole rocket thing you do with the space shuttle I got a better way his better way meant risking everything we have maybe about a week's worth of cash in the bank or or less I have to make a choice then that either took all of the capital that I had left from the sale of PayPal to eBay and invest that in Tesla or Tesla would die others weren't so willing to take a chance on him or his companies you put 90 billion dollars like 50 years worth a brace into into solar and wind to Sun its Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla enter one I mean I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers you pick the losers it's very unlikely that the Tesla investment has ever repaid to the taxpayers electric vehicles are really not possible in ways that would be effective for most consumers still but his bets paid off we didn't just repay the principal we actually repaid it with interest and an turbos pain so ultimately the US taxpayer actually made a profit of over 20 million dollars on this loan Elon Musk has even bigger dreams that might just take him farther than anyone else you know one must goes a step further earth not big enough the SpaceX he literally wants to go to Mars and lost too much I'd really love to go to Mars and that's the rushing role of SpaceX [Music] when I was a little kid I was really scared of the dog but then I I sort of came to understand okay well dark just means really the absence of photons in the visible wavelength 400 to 700 nanometers it's hard to believe that entrepreneur Elon Musk was ever afraid of anything in Elon sent darkness is merely the absence of light then I thought well it's really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons then I wasn't afraid at the drop anymore after that once one of the kids said to him look at the moon it's a billion miles away and he said well no it's actually under two hundred and fifty thousand miles away and they said Iran entrepreneur Elon Musk has spent his life proving people wrong growing up in South Africa musk was the oldest of three children and started school a year early his father was an engineer his mother Mae was a model and nutritionist he was the youngest made about two days and the shortest and then he was this brilliant boy and so people didn't really like him so I was this little bookworm a kid and probably a bit of a smart aleck so this is a recipe for disaster not that he told me much about it he was picked on quite a bit so just like read a read a lot of books and and tries to out of people's way during school and so his social life was much less than my other two kids and that's a typical nerd I read all the comics I could buy or that they let me read the bookstore before chasing me away I read everything I could get my hands on from when I woke up to when I went to sleep at one point I got I really ran out of books instead really encyclopedia and he has a photographic memory so he could remember everything anytime I had a question my daughter Tosca would say hole genius boy his brother Kimball musk when he Louis was ten years old he got tested by IBM and he was found to have one of the highest aptitudes they'd ever seen a full computer programming I tried to take some computer classes but I was way ahead of the teacher so it didn't really help so I saw her doing space game called blastaar musk already thinking like an entrepreneur figured out how to sell his game I realized I was 12 we decided we were gonna open an arcade outcome here near our high school we were in big into video games we figured that it was gonna be a huge hit we got a lease on a building we got the arcade provider to deliver the equipment and the only thing we needed to do by the end of it was get the city to approve what we were doing but an adult had to apply for a city permit and they hadn't told their parents what they were up to but of course they told us we were not gonna be opening up an arcade max chaff Caen is a technology and business journalist who has profiled Elon Musk several times really the most amazing thing about his childhood is his escape from from South Africa I remember thinking and saying that America is where we're great things are possible more than any other country in the world it's a little cliche but it's true america is the land of opportunity by moving musk would also avoid mandatory service in South Africa's army growing up in apartheid South Africa was pretty surreal I mean we didn't support that government we didn't believe in it and so the idea of actually going to the military service was really part of the question I told my parents I was going to to Canada and they tried convince me not to leave and off he flew and I thought wow he's so independent of course as soon as he lands he calls me he says what do I do now except water bus safe from Montreal to Vancouver and that allowed me kind of see Canada at least from the highway he worked at odd jobs across the country before settling at Queens College in Toronto back when I went to college I rarely went to class I just read the textbook and then show up for exams the bigger pills the University was being able to date girls my own age actually met my first wife their mas got an engineering and business degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a scholarship to go to Stanford Silicon Valley was the promised land I really wanted to just kind of go where where the really exciting breakthroughs were occurring Elon had this ability to to look at the world go this is a real problem that's going to in 20 years he looked around and he saw that the world changing stuff was not happening at Stanford I didn't even go to class I called the chair of the department and said I'd like to try selling this Internet company if probably won't succeed and so when it fails I want to make sure that technics still come back my kids do funny things and I'm never too concerned about them because you know if you no one wanted to drop out of college he could always go back my brother was in Canada at the time and I said look I think we should try to create an Internet company so he came down and joined me he had you know $2,000 no friends barely enough money for an apartment I think he told me he was showering at the gym because they didn't have a shower he was living we just got some few times that there were couches during the day and then turned into beds at night Steve Jurvetson is a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley I first met Elan and Kimball musk his brother back in the mid 90s when they first set foot in California I think they'd been here for about a week and they were pitching a new company called zip to Silicon Valley in the mid 90s in late 90s was a gold rush people were flocking to the region to find riches to make it in the internet business must came up with an idea to bring newspapers into the digital age he took a cd-rom yellow pages some mapping software wrote a little code and put it all together to create the first online city listings you know was more the business mastermind I was more than sales guy I still had my my core programming skills I was able to write the was the software needed for for the first company now when yuan was starting to keep in mind you know the internet was just a couple of years old most local businesses were not on the internet the way you found a local business was you open up the Yellow Pages they thought it was the media campaigns the newspapers are gonna need help coming online and building lots of functionality into their websites we had someone literally throw a Yellow Pages book at us and tell us do you think she will ever replace this and we put the guy who's crazy because not only were we gonna replace this but that's not where it ended keep going from there it wasn't long before media companies across the country were signing up and so we were able to get as investors with customers the new york times company Hearst knight-ridder and a number of other companies in 1999 the AltaVista division of Compaq bought zip2 for 307 million dollars in cash and 34 million in stock options musk was just 28 years old I hope that's crazy well I would somebody pay such a huge amount of money for this little company that we have it actually also turned out very well for them to actually so stuff there were a lot more about it than I did when the kid solves it - it was the most exciting day we couldn't believe it because you don't know in the internet world if you're going to you know make a million or die tomorrow [Music] in February 1999 Elon Musk sold his first company at 28 he joined the ranks of Silicon Valley millionaires since it was acquired by Compaq for a little over two million dollars and I made a play about 21 or 22 million dollars as a result of that which was a phenomenal amount of money for me it was obviously a financial windfall it was super fun to go out buy some toys one of his first things to do is go out and get a big sports car he's comes from a family that really enjoys racing in vehicles and he got one of the highest performance cars money could buy at the time it was a McLaren f1 and proceeded to enjoy that around the Bay Area let's say there's a number of adventures and respecting news with with his driving well I'm sure it felt you know wonderful to have all this money and and have people recognizing success I think he was also frustrated that this company hadn't become as great as he wanted to be it hadn't it hadn't changed the world it had just slightly altered the course of newspaper history which I think from his point of view is you know kind of piddling accomplishment so I certainly have a choice at that point of retiring and you know buying an island somewhere and sipping mai-tais but there was not of interest to me at all there really wasn't a choice of we weren't gonna do anything it was just really what we were gonna do next any landscapes in particular it was really just stepping stones the goal with in doing my second area company was to create something that would have a profound effect and it seems to me that the financial sector had not seen a lot of innovation on the Internet and money is really just an entry in a database and and it's so it's low bandwidth it seems like something I should lend itself to innovation he was very rich I mean just more money than most people could dream and he took almost no time in-between that sale and starting the company that became PayPal Musk's new company created something we take for granted today it changed the way the world buys things the way money is transferred from one person to another at the time transactions were very slow people would have to mail checks to each other so it could take weeks just to complete a single transaction with his windfall from the sale of zip to must quickly turned around and founded XCOM to make electronic cash transfer as possible but his new company collided with a rival mobile payment company called con Finity and they were really competing against each other and the real enemy at the end of the day was eBay we combined our efforts in order to compete effectively against eBay's built-in system they called the new company PayPal when he looked at PayPal that his goal was not to create a place you could do person-to-person payments his goal was good to transform the financial industry were able to become the the leading payment system in the world and then they finally threw in the towel and acquired PayPal in early 2002 musk and his partners sold PayPal for 1.5 billion dollars musk was the largest shareholder and walked away with 180 million he was 30 years old I could abort probably a chain of islands but but that big a no it's not it's just not a lot of interest to me Islands weren't of interest but outer space was it's just a much more exciting inspiring future for out that are exploring the Stars as opposed to the future where we are forever confined to earth I was thinking well I wonder when when we're going to Mars you know when is when is naphthenic go to Mars and I went to the NASA website and there was no plan to go to Mars and no plan to really even take the next step in space exploration this is he was saying he wants to go and enable the human civilization to leave the planet Earth I said it's about a big as big a vision as you could possibly imagine and that's gonna require funds and he has enough funds to go do it so he's gonna go do it musk had the outrageous idea that private enterprise could actually reenergize space travel and in June 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies or SpaceX Elon was the only funder of the company for this early years another incredibly risky move to say nobody on the planet thinks this idea is financeable I'm gonna fund all of it myself to the tune of almost a hundred million dollars which was the majority of his net worth at the time into a dream to take on the military-industrial complex now here's an immigrant from South Africa coming to America to say you know NASA that whole rocket thing you do with the space shuttle I got a better way actually travelled to Russia three times look at buying a refurbished ICBM without the nuke and I Kim's conclusion that the real thing that was really holding us back from making much more progress in space it was really that Rockets had not evolved since the 60s so the trick isn't figuring out how to get to orbit it's figuring out how to get to orbit cheaply so I had to come up with low-cost ways to produce engines the primary structure the electronics to the launch operation as well as run the company with very little overhead and to some of inventions in all those areas is what has led us to a roughly three to fourfold improvement over the cost of of other rockets in the United States what SpaceX has been very successful at is taking basically off-the-shelf technology stuff that was developed by NASA 50 years ago and streamlining it so in that way he's kind of the Henry Ford of of space because Henry Ford didn't invent the automobile he just figured out how to make the automobile you know commercially viable musk was more than just an entrepreneur if you ask yuan how he managed to teach himself rocket science he'll just look at you very seriously and just say very quietly read a lot of books thirty two-year-old Elon Musk had his next big idea at his family's annual visit to Burning Man the counterculture desert happening although still fascinated by rockets and fast cars he wanted to find a way to end Earth's addiction to fossil fuels I was one that the idea of going into the solar power arena to Lyndon and Peter I of my cousins he's basically hands this idea to his cousins and says if you want to start this I will I will fund you and it'll be your company but I'll be the Chairman and they say okay and it works almost perfectly what they've figured out is that if you sort of do a hundred things ten percent better in the area of solar cell installation for homeowners you can dramatically consolidate an industry that's currently a bunch of mom-and-pop shops so it Solar City instead was they say how about no money done you want solar cells we'll just put it in you don't pay a cent right it's like leasing a car but even better Solar City started in five western states and soon grew into the largest solar service provider in the US the solar cells keep going solar city that only goes up at the end at least so the fascinating business model were in the long run they may become the largest energy generator in America all of these but renewable energy was just one part of a much bigger goal musk had a more ambitious plan for a sustainable future he had this idea that he wanted to make electric cars help humanity get off fossil fuels and so cities about sustainable energy creation whereas Tesla's but sustainable energy consumption in April 2004 musk helped launch Tesla with six point three million dollars of his own money it was the first auto industry start-up in decades and the only one born in Silicon Valley and it's really pretty simple it's you know make a high-priced car at low volume because that's essentially the only thing we could afford to do and then step 2 is a medium priced car at medium volume since f3 is a low priced car at high volumes Tesla's plan to introduce a high-end high-performance product to first attract outliers then make an affordable car for the masses teslascope founder and first CEO Martin Eberhard we expect to to change the way people think about electric cars with this car and that we hope to open the market for us to sell other electric cars but we also know that if you start off by saying let's first change human nature and make everybody Drive crummy little cars that doesn't work so instead let's build a car that people want to drive let's build a car this is hot and desirable and beautiful and convince people that driving you know electric car is not a compromise its idea of actually going in and putting it in a high-end car and breaking the mold of what an electric car wars was exciting this is no longer gonna be a golf cart this is gonna be a Ferrari any cops watching when we first saw Tesla it had a good explanation for how they get to market without having to spend exorbitant amount of money how they would create a brand and the object of desire and consumers and it's part of the story clicked together he talked about Silicon Valley smarts being able to show Detroit how to do something that Detroit didn't think was possible its batteries its Drive electronics it's electric motors those are skills that are present in Silicon Valley and our president Detroit Tesla's revolutionary technology for the Roadster started with a computer battery as the power source for the automobile JB Straubel Tesla's chief technology officer was the main designer of the electric powertrain for the first time it was possible to drive over 200 miles and have performance that was directly comparable competitive with what a gasoline car could do and Tesla was the first company to to take those principles and put that into practice and try it California Governor Schwarzenegger showed up for the roadsters 2006 coming-out party a test of this one it's hot he bought one so did Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney but could must sell regular customers on his idea at that time there was very little activity in the auto industry in electric vehicles we were in the age of the large SUV so it was a little unusual to hear about this company in California that was planning to come to market with a high-end all-electric sports car we were very passionate about trying to make sure that this car was going to just throw down the gauntlet on what the technology could do and really prove to the world that electric vehicles you know could be incredibly fast and could have incredibly long range there was kind of a sense of adventure you know doing these things for the first time and doing it in a really scrappy way you know we did some of the very first battery packs in my garage in Menlo Park before we actually were able to rent a real office the big issue for Tesla as with all electric cars has been the batteries their cost and how long they last Eric Noble is president of car lab an automotive consulting firm that evaluates new cars and trucks American consumers are very ready for battery electric vehicles unfortunately battery electric vehicles aren't ready for American consumers the first results at Tesla seemed to support this gloomy forecast when we first started out the thought was simple and really obviously in retrospect quite naive which was to make use of some technology that we developed ourselves but also some technology that would license from AC propulsion put that together and create an electric sports car that would be compelling so let's see where did that fall apart it fell apart when the teen told musk that the projected cost had skyrocketed from $65,000 to 140,000 as the problems mounted musk faced a do-or-die decision at Tesla he would have to choose between investing his paypal pay off or let his new company collapse and Elon was looking at this and saying the dream is still there but oh my gosh what do I got I got to get this under control by 2007 Tesla was running out of money fast no one wanted to step up to save the unproven automobile startup Elon Musk had to take the leap alone with make some pretty dramatic changes essentially recapitalized the business and invest about twice what we originally expected what we really expected as the outer limit basically Tesla got to this point where they only had enough money in the bank for a couple of months and there's nobody around who are willing to put more money in I take all of my reserve capital and invested in Tesla which was very scary because you know it would actually be quite sad to have the fruits of my labor with subduer and PayPal not amount to anything but there was no question that I would do that in my mind because tells it was too important to till I die I'm available 24/7 just to help solve issues right I call me 3:00 a.m. in of Sunday morning I don't care we had to go in and make some really hard decisions on on personnel changes and even really had to dedicate his time to the company I want I want I want names named so if someone's always on the hot seat and it's always the root cause for problems they will not be positive organization long term it's not okay to be unhappy and part of this company and if somebody can't get happy right musk and his board replaced Martin Eberhard one of the co-founders who had been running Tesla and I think we kind of really really exceeded the level that Everhart could handle and they're freaking apparent in 2007 we either were gonna have to shut the company down or you know wasn't have to take over as CEO it was actually a process of building a company as well as building a car you know a lot of people that fit in very well with a company when it was extremely small you didn't end up you know fitting in as well when it was larger Everhard didn't go quietly he sued musk for libel slander and breach of contract I believe that I was scapegoated to take the blame for the programs that were not run well must resolve the disputes through mediation but his company was in serious financial trouble in September 2007 musk flew to Germany with a scheme to raise extra cash by forging an alliance with Daimler Mercedes it down is the company that invented the internal combustion engine car the maker of Mercedes smart and their endorsement carries great deal of weight so that was a just a very important moment he had to convince the company that Tesla could supply battery packs for its cars they were skeptical really the key thing was to demonstrate a hardware that worked you know if they can't touch it they can't drive it it's not particularly real he pushed his team to retrofit a Daimler smart car with Tesla's electric motor but first they had to find one the Challenger converting a smart card to electric was doubly difficult because we couldn't find a smart card the small cone for sale in the United States we had to send somebody down to Mexico to buy a smart car bring-bring 1/2 to the US and then the smoke is really tiny so we had to fit up a motor how electronics of charger and everything in the squad car the challenge was daunting to replace the smart cars gas engine with a Tesla drivetrain and battery fitted in the tiny space under the hood and do it all in less than 4 weeks we didn't have much time at all we knew that from the beginning and we kind of prepared for almost battle and you know setup war room in the shop they worked around the clock stealing maps on the factory floor right up to the deadline the Daimler executives arrived and nut it all convinced that it made any sense to work with an American car company let alone a little tiny American car company in Silicon Valley while waiting for Daimler's decision must brought in one of the world's leading automobile designers to help create his next project a modern and sexy family sedan what she called the Model S originally with Model S I thought well let's let's have Kerry Kiska who was had a design studio do the styling we paid him up pretty good sum of money to do that curiously enough the designs that he worked on that he came up with for us were terrible and what he didn't tell us was that he was actually working on a competing car company Tesla officials claimed that perhaps Henrik had come in to learn what Tesla was doing well all along he was planning to form his own company do his own vehicle we were pretty upset with him for basically taking what we're at the time the original specifications for the Model S and then going and shopping a business plan to create that same car Tesla sued him he sued Tesla and there was all kinds of you know infighting Henrik Fisker wouldn't grant Bloomberg an interview but he told us that I believe there is enough space in the market for several new car companies that pursue a new type of electrified powertrain with different philosophies in November 2008 the court ruled in Fiskars favor it was a setback for musk who was also going through a tough time personally after eight years of marriage and five children Elon and Justine musk divorced I got divorced personal life in somewhat of a shambles and in addition getting you know attacked by some in the media my ex-wife every bad thing you could imagine there was more bad news when his bold space transport company SpaceX again failed to get a rocket in support the First Lord didn't get very far got about a minute up and then it was that there was an engine fire and that was it the second flight actually did make it to space but not too overt and then also flight 3 we didn't get all the way to orbit he started saying I've got enough money for three cracks at it he put a hundred million dollars of his own money and he sort of hinted that the idea that after three he didn't make it it would be over SpaceX would would die must burn through the 100 million he had sunk into SpaceX now he was on his way back to the drawing board three days after the failure he announced like first that he knew what was wrong he announced that they raised money to finance a fourth and the fourth launch was gonna happen in a matter of months which in the rocket industry was a crazy announcement we were able to sell the palms and then just as we'd solve those problems where you ran smack into the the worst economic recession since the Great Depression it's been one of the darkest days on Wall Street and recent memory stock markets falling the most since 9/11 the Dow off more than 500 points this is what financial Armageddon looks like red screams that scream sell sell sell it was a week that shook Wall Street and indeed the world and a realization that the economy may still head into a deeper downturn as 2008 drew to a close Elon Musk faced the worst crisis of his career all three of his companies appear to be in freefall the worst point was probably just the weekend before Christmas in 2008 we had the economic tsunami take place and made things even worse if it wasn't needed we had to shut it down and and just figure out what's how do we get through this the stock period and not go bankrupt General Motors shares falling to more than a 20-year low after Goldman cut the automakers rating to sell on a worsening sales outlook that was tough it was obviously an economic period that swore the bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler and there we were a young company selling a very very optional car I mean it was really you'd people don't need $100,000 sports car and they certainly wouldn't want one getting poor reviews the popular BBC programme Top Gear took the Tesla Roadster on a test drive in December 2008 this car then really was shaping up to be something wonderful [Music] although Tesla say it'll do 200 miles we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out it's not a quick job to charge it up again the combative CEO charged the incident was faked and said he had proof that the Roadster had not run out of power he sued the BBC to block reruns of the show the case was later dismissed but things would get even tougher his energy company Solar City founder the bank that had backed their leases pulled out of the deal I certainly did not anticipate that we would have the worst economic climate since the Great Depression and and one which was disproportionately bad for cars I mean General Motors went bankrupt I mean general general effing motors you know musk was in the fight of his life we had maybe about a week's worth of cash in the bank all or less and there was just very little time left in the year to resolve these these things I mean they were like two or three business days left in the year I never thought I was hot it was possible for me to have a nervous breakdown but if it was possible for me to have a nice break down there that was about as good as that's going to come when Eden was going through his sad period I was so sad I felt like I had a hole in my heart and there's nothing you can do you just hurt so much and I just didn't see him getting out of it he was just so sad and then the next thing I get this call saying wow you have made a wonderful woman the one bright spot was meeting Talulah Riley a British actress who had never heard of Tesla SpaceX or Elon Musk they married in 2010 I could be some sort of hapless engineer that had wandered into a London club and he just looked so forlorn he was just sat in the corner on his Blackberry cific he was really out of place and sad I was you know trying to be very sweet to him and instead of humoring him going oh yes when he was gay this is my rocket and this is my Musk's personal life was looking up and the future of SpaceX was finally taking off the fourth attempt to launch the Falcon 1 was a huge success and three months later NASA rewarded SpaceX with a 1.6 billion dollar contract to resupply the International Space Station but musk had no time to celebrate Tesla was on the verge of financial disaster I had to make a choice then that either took all of the capital that I had left from the sale of PayPal to eBay and invest that in Tesla or Tesla would die the company is really teetering on the brink of failure and there's this board meeting late in 2008 where they're discussing what's gonna happen and Elon just says well I'm gonna raise a 40 million dollar round to keep the company going and the board members are kind of wondering well how is he gonna do that and he says I'm gonna put it all in myself and that incredible braggadocio confidence catalyzed a change in people's opinion and we and everyone else around the table is like oh my gosh we want to be part of this want to get as much of this investment as we can he saved the company in its darkest hour with an act of heroism that is hard to describe there's nothing quite like spending your last remaining dollar on a project you believe in it was thankfully they could a good week but it definitely took its toll from the mental strain standpoint handicapped man play just burned out a few circuits just after his emergency cash infusion came the news they desperately needed a 40 million dollar deal with Daimler for smart car batteries Daimler later added 50 million for 10% of the company determined not to repeat past mistakes musk focused on bringing his family car to life so I said look we really we need to have our own design studio and that's when I hired fronts from the host housing to design the Model S his green agenda was irresistible to van Holt thousand a legendary figure in car design who had already revolutionized the looks of the wgm and Mazda he's completely passionate to really rid the world of this addiction to fossil fuel and that that was something that he talked about from the very first sentence first conversation that we had with a new team in place must completely revamp the look of the Model S a sedan doesn't have to be a brick doesn't have to be a big blocky car we wanted to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bring this kind of passion and feeling back to this marketplace the architecture of monoliths is really similar to escape word the floor of the vehicle is the battery pack and the motors between the rear wheels and everything above that is the opportunity's base in March 2009 musk unveiled the prototype for the Model S it could hold seven passengers and as much luggage as a station wagon but to build it he knew he needed a piece of the US government's new 7.5 billion dollar loan program to support alternative energy vehicles in order for Model S to truly be successful you know it was important that the the loan come through the government funding was controversial the New York Times writer Randy Stross called the program the bailout of very very high net worth individuals who invested in Tesla Motors act musk struck back Randy's cross is a huge douche bag and an idiot okay it wasn't a bailout but alone the Obama administration agreed to lend Tesla four hundred and sixty five million dollars to mass-produced the Model S a move that astounded many in the industry it's very unlikely that the Tesla investment has ever repaid to the taxpayers electric vehicles are really not possible in ways that would be effective for most consumers still this is just the religion of electric vehicles and like Jonestown that religion will come to an end there are most certain people who want to see Tesla fail because it is an attack on the mainstream car industry of course the biggest impact that test will have is not the cause that we make ourselves but the fact that we show that you can make compelling electric cars that people really want to buy the government loan came with a challenging condition to get the money he had to first find a place to build his electric car Tesla burned through 300 million dollars since 2003 Elon Musk needed to get his model s into production fast ever the risk-taker he took another giant gamble purchasing a plant in Fremont California abandoned by Toyota The Dream Factory location where Tesla was always the new me factory which was a 50-percent Toyota factory sent General Motors factory it's one of the biggest car plants in the world it's a great location close to Tesla headquarters the reality is for very little money Toyota got an albatraoz off its books from an industry perspective it looked incredibly savvy on Toyotas part and incredibly naive on Tesla's part car factories are big pieces of sunk capital to retool a factory it takes a tremendous incremental investment the acquisition released the government funds to begin production despite the fact that Tesla had posted a profit just once since its founding musk took his company public in June 2010 the smartest money in the world is is betting on Tesla not everyone was as upbeat about the company's future Tesla stock voted by Wall Street as the least likely to succeed you don't want on this stock you don't want you shouldn't even write the darn thing there hasn't been an IPO of a car company in America since Henry Ford and that caught people's attention investors ignored the skeptics Tesla raised 226 million dollars in its IPO must now had the capital to get rolling on the Model S you just saw on his face this sort of just relation and this feeling like all of this suffering is worth it and it's anger and it's real now in 2010 after winning the 1.6 billion dollar contract from NASA SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch and return a spacecraft from orbit so SpaceX was the first purely commercial ground-up development to reach orbit the first successful launch at SpaceX was I'm just wishing through any entities that are listening please bless this launch and two years later in May 2012 it made history as the first privately held company to send a cargo payload to the International Space Station back on earth the long-awaited launch of Tesla's new sedan was also taking off its time delivery model s the Model S started rolling off the production line although questions about range and service remained not everyone was cheering in a 2012 presidential debate Republican candidate Mitt Romney blasted President Obama for the government loan to Tesla lumping Tesla in with other financially troubled green companies you put 90 billion dollars like 50 years worth of breaks into into solar and wind to suck it Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and enter one I mean I add a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers he picked the losers but Tesla was no loser in the eyes of the automotive industry the Model S was the first electric sedan to win motor trends Car of the Year musk didn't have much time to celebrate a few months later the New York Times delivered a devastating review of the Model S it reported the battery died on its test drive from Washington to Boston and published an image no CEO would want there was a sad shot of about car owner on a flatbed as though that was the only outcome possible for for such a drive and that's just that's just not true musk went on the offensive unless people said oh you know should it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong you don't battle the New York Times and it's like the hell with that the battle between the reporter and the renegade CEO ended when the New York Times public editor concluded the reporting was imprecise but not done in bad faith but the story didn't affect his bottom line remember that loser comment from a presidential candidate about the 465 million dollar government loan it really feels good to have have repaid the US taxpayer that's that's really what's important here and and we're not we didn't just repay the principal we actually repaid it with interest and and a bonus pay and so ultimately the the US taxpayer actually made a profit of over 20 million dollars on this Tesla repaid the loan nine years ahead of schedule never short on optimism or confidence musk made a stunning promise for the nearly $70,"000 car we're guaranteeing that the value of the Model S will be no less than that of a Mercedes s-class after three years I am personally guaranteeing that value and standing behind that guarantee with all of my assets not just with with Tesla he has guaranteed free charging for the life of the car and has expanded the charging system across the country you'll be able to travel all the way from LA to New York just using the Tesla supercharger network and supercharger system is free so it's not just free now it's get free forever that's the Tesla commitment his commitment to customers has paid off since its IPO Tesla shares were up more than fivefold SpaceX and Solar City were also turning profits and this is a biggest and most important customer but almost three quarters of our customers are commercial SpaceX says it has more than four billion dollars in revenue under contract but of all his companies perhaps the greatest success was the one addressing the world's energy need Solar City is now the largest solar service provider in the US and has more than quadrupled in value since its initial public offering in December 2012 Solar City has been very very impressive I mean there are you know thousands of people with panels on their roofs and and lots of big offices I believe eBay has solar city panels so it's it's having a very big very visible impact on the world he really wants to change the world and in my vision of the future that you'll have clean and renewable sources of energy feeding the grid and our all of our vehicles will run off that this is really the future it's something wonderful stories about Iran has a self-confidence that is just it's breathtaking and it's especially breathtaking when you think about the things he's confident about the idea that Humanity is gonna get to Mars that not just humanity is gonna get to Mars that but that he in his lifetime Elon Musk will get to Mars Crusader or canny businessman named one of Time Magazine's most influential people in the world the risk-taking multitasking CEOs estimated net worth was six billion dollars in June 2013 divorced for the second time musk splits his time between his five sons his companies and thinking about the future just is it significant it really is question is all things I'm working on are they really gonna matter or do they have the potential for really matter

Insider,x-DNaDlSqBQ,"[""earlier this month Airlines for America trade group representing the major US airlines as a federal government for 50 billion dollars in assistance to protect and preserve the 750,000 jobs of hard-working men and women who are directly employed by US airlines this set up a heated showdown there's the industry which says it's in desperate need of financial help and then there are elected officials and activists who say the airlines would not be in this position if they did not spend so much of their money on stock buybacks which a lot of people see as the companies lining the pockets of shareholders over all else buybacks are often used as a way to boost a company's stock price the repurchase a shrink shares outstanding which increases the value of the remaining units they're frequently viewed as a signal from management that the stock is attractively priced so we're going to take a look at the airline's as own data to help explain why people are so mad about this bailout let's start with American Airlines it's the biggest airline in the US and reported having the most a hundred thirty four thousand employees in 2019 let's take a moment here to watch the amount American paid in salary wages and benefits grow over the last 10 years now it dips alone in 2013 but let's not focus on that instead take a look at the end point here in 2019 American reported paying all of its employees a grand total of twelve point six billion dollars now let's add another line this is the amount Americans spent on a share buyback program which just means money used to buy back its own stock it's a move that financially engineer share price gains which enriches shareholders this didn't start happening until 2014 when the company spent just over 1 billion dollars on its stock its buyback program shot up for the next couple of years before coming back down and staying around the 1 billion dollar mark so we've got a billion here almost 4 billion here 4.5 billion here and this and this carry the 1 and if you add it all up American has spent twelve point nine billion dollars over the last six years on its own stock people are mad because twelve point six billion is what it cost to pay the employees salaries for an entire year and he would add up everything on this buyback line it surpasses that amount and while stock buybacks are fairly common there are some companies that do have large emergency funds Apple a company that was on the brink of insolvency in the 90s is famous for having a ton of cash on hand as of January the company had more than 200 billion dollars in the bank call it a rainy day fund call it a possible Netflix acquisition the company has built up one giant emergency fund this might not be the case for the airline's though that was American let's look at Delta it's the second-biggest airline and has about 91 thousand full-time employees whose wages benefits and everything else added up to just under 11 and a quarter billion dollars in 2019 now let's look at Delta's buyback program didn't exist in the beginning of the decade but in 2013 its 250 million dollars in the annual report a year later it's more than a billion to 2.6 all the way through to the end of 2019 over the past seven years Delta spent just under 11 and a half billion dollars buying back its own stock that's almost the exact same amount and spent paying all of its employees salaries and benefits in 2019 let's do one final airline united on March 20th the airline sent out a letter saying it had already taken drastic measures due to the downturn in travel and would have to reduce payroll to match a 60% cutting capacity if Congress didn't act soon the airline reported 96 thousand employees at the end of 2019 if we take a look at the last ten years of its payroll we can see that in 2019 United paid out about 12 billion dollars in salaries benefits and other related items let's bring on uniting spy back program this one began in 2014 at 252 million dollars the following year it's more than a billion it crosses 2 billion in 2016 comes back down a bit and in 2019 it's about 1.6 billion dollars the total amount spent on buybacks for that five-year period is 8.8 billion dollars that's about 75% of the entire amount spent on wages and benefits for all of 2019 now of the 750,000 employees Airlines for America says it represents these three Airlines for about three hundred twenty thousand of them and collectively they would need about thirty six billion dollars to pay them for an entire year and collectively over the last seven years they've spent about thirty three point three billion buying back their own stock the stimulus bill has about 60 billion dollars set aside for the airlines to be able to pay their debts pay their employees and basically keep the lights on but the buyback numbers are what really dominated the talks of any help for the airlines so people are saying any airline that is helped by federal funds aka taxpayer money should have various conditions attached like not being able to buy back stock for a certain period of time and the no buybacks became a major point of contention and any talk of federal help many airlines have spent the last decade doing things to increase profits at the cost of passenger comfort like decreasing legroom to add more seats and increasing checked bag fees those increased profits were in part used to buy back stock and now the airlines are asking those same passengers with less legroom and $50 check bag fees to keep them afloat the no buybacks demand worked the loans and grants the stimulus bill has for the airlines does have caveats that it can't be used for buyback programs and the bill requires any company receiving assistance to freeze anyone's pay who is receiving more than four hundred twenty five thousand dollars a year meaning no large increases for executives like CEOs we reached out to the airlines for comment American Airlines told us it had invested twenty billion dollars in wages and benefits while returning thirteen and a half billion dollars to owners and stakeholders the airline also said these are extraordinary circumstances travel restrictions and the downturn in demand for commercial and transportation has been Swift and dramatic Delta told us it invested billions of dollars back in our business improve the customer experience in the air and on the ground achieved an investment grade balance sheet by paying down debt and funding our pension with the remainder returned to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends United said in a statement it had the highest growth in profit sharing for our workers last year all which far exceeds our share repurchases and that it had suspended its share repurchase program last month now the airlines might not have just put this money in the bank if they didn't do buybacks the money could have been used for R&D machinery reinvestment buying another company pretty much anything and the downturn caused by the coronavirus is not the airlines his fault but the speed at which they were affected might make any CEO start to put away a bigger emergency fund just in case""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As seen on C-SPAN.",C-SPAN,INxuaI5Wosw,"[""thank you Steve thank you very much a Laura and I are delighted to be here actually we are we you know we got to learn to laugh in this town and I appreciate the humor I really do I think a society that can poke fun of its political leaders is a society that's a confident society in a free society so we're delighted and I was looking forward to doing a little poking myself but in light of this week's tragedy at Virginia Tech I decided not to be funny many of the men and women in this room have spent this week reporting from Blacksburg Virginia you have interviewed reading students and faculty members you have spoken with the families who lost the child you have brought home to millions of Americans the sense of sorrow and loss that the Virginia Tech community is going through now and I appreciate your work at a memorial service on Tuesday I've told the university community that people all over this country are thinking about them and many are praying for them and so really this dinner comes at a at a good time it's been a tough week for a lot of folks particularly the folks in Virginia Tech and so I'm not going to try to be the funny guy but I had the opportunity to introduce one who will be and so thanks for the dinner and it's now my honor to bring to this podium a talented and good man rich little Thank You mr. president I

wasn't he and he had so many so many different tics you know you know I I've been married four times and and the last the last divorce was the worst because after that divorce I was so upset I went into a bar I sat down on the bar I I don't believe I said this because this isn't really like me but I was really angry forgive me for saying this I actually yelled out in the bar all lawyers are assholes and the guy next to me says I I resent that I said really are you a lawyer he said no no I'm an asshole anyway I in the bar with this clown for the whole evening and at one o'clock in the morning the bartender said gentlemen it's time I I'm closing up and at this point this Joker that I I've been sitting with fell off the stool he couldn't get up he tried three times to get up he could not get up so I I went up to the bartender and I said where does this guy live and the bartender told me so I I picked him up and carried him out to my car and I drove him over to his house and when we got there I couldn't get him out of the car so I dragged him out of the car lifted him up one more time and carried him up his front porch and rang the doorbell and his wife came to the door and I said madam this is your husband I'm I'm bringing him home from the bar she said that that's very nice of you but what did you do with his wheelchair okay you know who else I could do for you tonight

what the hell do you plan here's something else that I don't understand how do deer know to cross of those little yellow signs never wondered about that this is stupid if those sign were intended for deer they would have been printed in deer language dumb here's something else if the sign makers people who make signs if they go on strike what the hell do they hold up if your vacuum cleaner sucks

ships styrofoam what the hell do they pack it in if you choke a smurf what color would you turn if you overdose on viagra how would you get the coffin lid closed never think about this I think about

and of course they didn't and we knew this but nonetheless at that particular time we were willing to negotiate with a group or a fraction within the group that was willing to negotiate with us and we went in there knowing that we weren't going to show up and when we got there we realized they weren't there either so then we wondered why the hell we went in the first place my god if they weren't there and we weren't there why did we even consider to go there at all this was a waste of time and frankly unamerican we put a lot of time into this and a lot of money and we didn't show up but they

and I remember I remember one one weekend I was down on San Clemente it was a beautiful day I took our little dog checkers I put him on the leash and took him for a walk in this field and we were walking along and I I was enjoying the afternoon beautiful day I was looking at the trees and and the flowers and the birds damn liberals and I was walking along and all of a sudden I noticed that the corner of my eye a car coming along the west side of the property and I looked came it it was a reporter it was a reporter from the Union Tribune unless clown got out of his car and he recognized me out there and he leaned over the fence and he said mr. Nixon is that you out there now this is where I made my mistake I should have told him the truth I should but that of course is against my nature so I decided to be funny I decided to be witty and that also is totally against my nature I don't know why I did this but here is this clown yelling out at me it's obvious what the hell I'm doing he said what are you doing out there so I said I'm trying to win a Nobel Peace Prize and he looked he looked at me he said but I said you heard me dum-dum I'm trying to win a Nobel Peace Prize and he said I don't understand I said well listen if you want to win a Nobel Peace Prize you have to be out standing in your field you didn't gather I said you have to be outstanding in your field this clown didn't get it either he took me seriously I was trying to be funny so he went back to the paper and he rode up he rode up on his column he said Richard my son's gone he's lost he's gone he's you be committed he said the wheel is still spinning but it's obvious the rodent is dead he said he's two sandwiches short of a picnic his elevator doesn't go to the top and I was outraged I was outraged reading this I couldn't believe but this but then what this fellow had written so I own down with the paper to get a retraction and I argued with him for about two hours got absolutely nowhere absolutely no and I realized was hopeless so I I walked out of his office walked to the elevator and I said to myself I said myself this doesn't really matter who the hell cares what he says I've had worse things than this written about me and after all I've lived a life that's full and not only have I lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every Highway but more much more than that the silent majority I did it my way for what is a man what has she gone if not himself then he has naught but through it all I made mistakes if only I'd erase those tapes the record shows I took the ball and oh my thank you very much I appreciate your reaction thank you for inviting me here today and you know it's good to laugh I know we're going through troubled times right now but you got a laugh and you got a smile and take your mind off you know things that are going on so if I made you laugh or smile the last half-hour it was all worthwhile thank you very very much""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,0,Busting phone scammers: Police raids shine light on overseas call centres (Marketplace),"Marketplace journalists got exclusive access to an undercover RCMP investigation into major scam calls that have bilked Canadians of millions of dollars. For two years, we have zeroed in on scammers in Indian call centres targeting Canadians: posing as CRA tax agents, tech support workers or impersonating police and other government officials. Many of you have come forward with stories of being contacted by these scammers and asked why authorities can’t do more to stop these schemes.

access catching the scammers in our backyard it certainly helped CBC did their expose or episode on marketplace first the CRA scan I fed them the inside story from India we were trained like that who pretend to be legen our iris officer then tracking the tech support scam why do you do this illegally what does it say that we were able to get inside calls for action make sure that Canadians are protected organized criminals and the scams won't stop their money laundering CRA scam tech support scams sin skin all connected feeding on each other's leads revealed only on your marketplace [Music] just outside Toronto federal agents are gearing up the rest go after months of investigation they're about to carry out key arrests way comes Oh we'll be cracking down on an international scale targeting Canadians safety we have exclusive access to witness this takedown rates 2 a.m. we've just got the call we've been waiting months to receive we knew the Mounties have been watching alleged scammers and how they tell us they're ready to move in in some ways this began two years ago with an investigation of our own on the other side of the world it's a scam Canadians know all too well not the real Canada Revenue Agency but one of the largest cyber schemes in Canadian history there will be legal as we work to locate the scam centers in Mumbai India we met up with a whistleblower who previously worked inside one Jayesh Dube it was big money yeah it was big money more than you would make anywhere else I can only get anywhere no easy to read the script threatened the person on the other end of the line all while impersonating an American tax agent thank you for calling IRS home LP so we were trained like that to become an IRS officer to pretend to be like an hourish officer you're threatening people you're saying they could go to jail they could get arrested do you could get arrested if you cry to fight against the IRS then the penalty is $75,000 which you can never pay and your assets and all is going to get please we track calls like that to a scam center inside this building [Music] but when our local helpers knock on the door so the the call center has moved out they some of they realized someone was on to them it turns out the danger is still there so it's now clear to us this area is dangerous that we need to get out that we're being watched and other people who went into the building for us they're being followed it all shows how dangerous these scammers can be why do you think they were following him we still have questions how do the scammers know who to call how do they get money from victims could it be there's an accomplice at the top in Canada Jahangir rashidi has those same questions how did this start with one call phone call they call and they said this is Revenue Canada and Government of Canada lawsuit view for ninety nine thousand five hundred dollar what did you think when you heard it's a huge amount I said I don't have it he said go and borrow from the bank go to your friend go to your employee go wherever you can make money doesn't matter just you have to pay you have to pay you pay he's from Iran where the government actually does make demands like this he worried the call was legit and paid big one hundred and ten thousand altogether forty five thousand was my RSP and then five thousand dollar my saving account $4,000 for my last paycheck checking account $5,000 from my son and the rest credit card long line of credit is life savings gone back in India so how long have you been police commissioner here top cop Paramveer Singh says the scam kingpins are leading a rich light one of the main accused he had a very high-profile lifestyle he was probably thinking about buying a private jet also at that point of time a private jet he was thinking of buying one yes funded by million stolen from victims living in North America and Commissioner Singh has another shocker about police in Canada nobody contacted us from Canada no one's caught no one no one contacted American authorities did contact us no one contacted although on the website of RCMP and we did see a post relating to other cases once but you're telling me 60,000 people at least have complained in Canada and nobody from Canada is doing anything nobody pointed and the only way you found out about it is by going on the RCMP website yourself that's right yeah that doesn't seem right they don't simply when our story airs across Canada there is outrage can the Public Safety Minister explain why Canadians have to depend on the CBC to unearth this scam and protect Canadians will the Prime Minister tell us how we will follow up to ensure that these calls stop and to make sure that Canadians are protected against organised criminals in India services and intelligence agents to do what needs to be done to protect Canadians at home and overseas the RCMP later say they have been talking to India but all this attention puts the issue on the front burner empowering more people to come forward this is really scary this is really scary my stomach was just at SEC you feel thick a month after our story taught brass order a special task force be set up at this secure facility outside Toronto we get inside the headquarters but what the RCMP call project Octavia it's essentially a national priority investigation and inspector Jim Ogden has a surprise certainly what I know and what I can share is that there are our known targets leads when we get enough evidence then we will charge and prosecute these individuals and just so I'm clear are we talking about people who are in this country in Canada that's correct who are helping carry out this scam that's correct they're defrauding the Canadian public and sending it sending it away they're their money laundry while the Mounties focus on tracking the Canadians connected to this crime our trail took us back to India a year after our first investigation into the CRA scam and we closed in on the call centers carrying out another one this time we had something up our sleeve hiring someone to sneak in a hidden camera were the first to get inside the tech support scam with criminals using scare tactics to demand payment for a computer fix you likely don't need what made you think this was legitimate he sounded genuinely concerned and led me to believe that he could fix the problem when Diane begins Facebook account stops working she calls up a number she thinks is for Facebook support but ends up with a convincing scammer instead when you look back on it now how do you feel about it I was vulnerable at the time and I was impulsive yeah and I feel very violated that they had access to everything on our computer our laws should protect us against things like this after months of our own investigation we're ready to confront those targeting Canadians which is amazing to think it's right here back in India we've seen the scammers can be dangerous so we're moving quickly [Music] the company whose name is at this address says this is a legitimate operation but we know some of the people inside are running a scam why do you have a call center here why do you do this illegally we want to talk to top bosses there are real victims real victims these are real people who cannot afford to lose this money you're taking it from them it seems no one here wants to talk to us at least while we're here they're off the phones anyone want to say anything nobody okay back in Canada we share our findings with the RCMP s highest-ranking Financial Crimes official superintendent Peter Payne what does it say that we were able to get inside a call center like this yeah no I applaud your efforts for getting in there but once again police alone cannot solve this issue there's lots of call centers over what do you say to the scammers were over there if you think they're unstoppable uh we're not giving up this battle turns out that's a bit of foreshadowing the Mounties know there are accomplices in Canada they know who they are we're about to find out too this is your market place on the roads outside Toronto a man has no idea police are on his tail the RCMP closing in on Canadians they say are accomplices in an enormous cyber scheme and we're about to witness it all go down we're just outside the RCMP secure facility after months of investigation into some of the largest cyber schemes in Canadian history they're ready to take action and these are schemes like the CRA scam the tech support scam the bank investigators scanned the syn card scam all of it coming to a head early this morning we started our investigation in October of 2018 inspector Jim Ogden oversees project Octavia the specialists unit investigating oversees call center scams my message is that we'll find you and we'll we'll further investigate and we'll we'll charge where we can we've traced many of these scams back to India like the tech support scam how much money was stolen from you three thousand three thousand dollars when now hid fill opposes phone stops working she Google's a solution and calls the number that appears on her screen he went onto the phone and he said there are many problems on the phone there are hackers from Russia from India from Brazil he said all that about your phone yeah he said it's a complicated issue we need to work on this phone has to be minimum three thousand dollars to be able to do the transaction now he pays on her money gone I said where's my money is where does one money are you with this converse are you thieves he's then hung up the phone then I tied the game like ten times twelve times nobody want to answer even as police close in on multiple scams the scammers are adapting adding a new scheme involving Canadian Social Insurance numbers we just offended your social insurance number and legal enforcement action will be taken against you as we found some suspicious activities and law enforcement is getting help from a big name in the tech world that's bringing us back to Microsoft headquarters near Seattle and the inside its Digital Crimes Unit we were here a year ago checking out how artificial intelligence is helping trace the scammers this is a very profitable crime with a very low risk of prosecution we need to invert that equation lawyer one hard way overseas the global unit here feeding tips and evidence to India over the last ten months Indian law enforcement has dismantled ferry call centers has brought to justice seventy two directors of call centers there but Microsoft tells us while there have been arrests in India there hasn't been one conviction of a scam boss since 2014 you got this letter right show me that that's really interesting but Hardaway says they're not giving up continuing their war with the scammers he says Microsoft gets a complaint of someone impersonating their agents every seven minutes but guys are now selling calls for call centers to exploit it's almost like a scam franchise exactly and it has evolved into that because there's so much money to be made and as I said the profits are so big relative to the investment our own investigation has led us to believe that there are people in Canada helping with this scam helping move money and do other things is that something that you understand as well yeah that's correct one trail leads to this house in suburban Vancouver CBC the first to discover court documents which accused the man who lives here of retrieving the money for a fraud connected to these scams he even allegedly moves approximately a million dollars through his accounts prosecutors say that is laundering the proceeds of unlawful activity and are trying to seize the house his father owns it and denies any wrongdoing while his son has now reportedly fled to China we need to target the wallets of the bad guys so that if the money stops flowing they're not going to be able to keep their operation running and they will go out of business Microsoft is targeting those money mules and talking the Canadian police about how to do it we're working with law enforcement and with also other banks financial services industries to identify those bad bank accounts or merchant accounts so that they can be suspended and money be returned to victims and they're not the only ones Canadian police are hot on the case too the Mounties are about to take down what they call a super money mule a top-level scam associate who lives right here in Canada who they are and how the Mounties found them coming up this is your marketplace it's a federal raid our CMP officers about to move in there on the tail of a man they say is a big player in scam calls that plague Canadians they took away my trust my confidence everything now hid philipose is a victim of one of those scams she's waited a long time to see action who should be trying to stop these guys why done that what it is in Canada and India cooperate together victims like knobhead and all of us who get these calls incessantly are about to see the RCMP act seconds after the target arrives at work officers move in we're not allowed to get any closer to this Factory in Georgetown Northwest of Toronto as the man and the reflective jacket is taken into custody everything in his pockets placed in bags by police seems he had no idea that he was being surveilled that people police officers were following him and they got him just as he showed up for work we've agreed not to identify the police since many of them are undercover the man is being charged with fraud money laundering and property obtained by crime we watch as he's taken away a morning he'll probably never forget as the man arrives at the RCMP headquarters in Milton Ontario to be fingerprinted and processed officers are on the phone to his wife telling her she's wanted - her husband already in custody she's told to turn herself in and were there when she arrives [Music] they were essentially money mules or money mule managers that were receiving bags of cash RCMP inspector Jim Ogden tells us his team's investigation shows this couple was working directly with Indian scammers and then essentially dispersing it and making it accessible to those that are running the illegal call centers in India what helped get you to this point today the CBC Marketplace episode you did in India certainly raised a flag for the public safety minister and a senior representatives in the RCMP at a later news conference Gurinder Preet dhaliwal 37 years of age from Brampton Ontario and inderpreet Delhi well 36 years of age also from Branton are charged with the following criminal offenses one count of fraud over $5000 one count of laundering the proceeds of crime and one count of property obtained by crime the Mounties reveal thousands of dollars in cash more than a hundred thousand in jewelry even a money counting machine allegedly used by the couple the couple have yet to appear in court to submit a plea in response to the charges it's about time a lot time guys we show footage of the arrests tonight when you see a guy like that in handcuffs I'm happy definitely very happy about that and I appreciate what the police has done to do this this is a big victory even if I'm not getting my money I'm happy that an action is being taken for other people to be saved this is very important kudos to the woman who knew interviewed and was willing to come forward and tell everything tell all victims need to see that that they're not alone watching the RCMP take down mark simcha s'en the former head of a major fraud unit good for them good for them well bloody time this is something that you've waited a long time to see are you surprised that it's happened I wanted to have faith and I'm glad they proved me right that's kudos to them because that must have been really difficult must have been really difficult and kudos to marketplace and hookahs because here are the ones that instigated all of this in my view what do you know the likelihood is that these scam calls disappear not very not very they're gonna continue the frequency may drop may change why is that because there's still victims here that are vulnerable fraud is you know it's theft with a smile the arrests aren't over the RCMP say they're targeting more people in Canada and abroad this is gonna be a deterrent for sure we're gonna get our co-conspirators that are here in this province thinking twice about well I thought we were untouchable and they're not it's the counterfeit crackdown it says in big red letters we don't sell any fakes five companies 100 products I'm shocked by me other people are just happening too how many other people don't even know

sounds gross but could it be dangerous we buy some cakes and fruit tarts for lab testing I brought you some food products to take a look at but to our surprise when we open the box let's check out this cake it's a fruit torte Wow look at that holy cow this has not passed its best before dating there's already mold on it it's very already this is good this is Wow can't believe how much mold is on it yes hmm has this cake been doctored the store said it's not passed the best before date we asked Warriner to help us simulate what our insider tells us about what happens to cakes and tarts two weeks past their best before dates on day one of our test that moldy cake surprisingly still safe to eat but nearly two weeks later so these are yeasts and moles and you might see these orange ones here look pretty don't they yeah if you ingest that toxin what can happen well nothing will happen to you instantly but what over time it can lead to things like cancer so that this is why we have these best-before by dates rarely to stop these sort of things happening yikes and he says the longer these toxins stay on foods past their best before dates more potential growth and risk and there's more this comes in the form of we'll call an entry bacteria which is a fecal indicator a fecal indicator on the torch on the chart that's a lot of handling when you produce these stalks can introduce a third degree of Cody farms and other bacteria you found a lot lurking on the surface of that torch it was I could see of microbes underneath the fruit it ready wasn't it the number back to you I amazed me as a microbiologist that even these microscope grow so high in a cave pretty disturbing almost two weeks past their best before date the fruit tarts are loaded with toxins - this is a specialist it's a mold that produces a mica toxin which can be very fatal over the long period of time our insider says she didn't know there could be potential risks but why did she do it when you're working there it's part of your job and you're told to do it and you're not really at a place in your life where you can take a stand or say anything about it so what's her advice for you I would personally avoid buying any cake or pie or bakery product that isn't in its original form if it's been cut in half or cut into smaller pieces there's probably a reason for it back on the street what do you think one tip from these former workers is you should buy foods in the bakery in its original form no it's an advice that I should start sharing a lot of my family members and friends that's a good piece of information yeah that's definitely something I can use in the future Loblaws won't come on camera but after learning about our findings they tell us they've reinforced their bakery policies with all their stores we wonder if what we're hearing is unique to the bakery department so we design a national online call-out and aleshia how's it going good I'm just checking out some of our results we hear from grocery workers who've worked at retailers big and small from coast to coast in the deli bakery produce and meat departments I have witnessed seafood that was expired be turned into chowder mix oh that's disgusting yep across the country they share disturbing secrets of what goes on behind the counter oh look at that one we would take unpackage pies cakes cookies and repackage them as a single serving dessert that's not good take a look at this one meat was rewrapped best before date was changed person after person is writing in about changing the best afford eggs that's shocking so as we were researching this story it turns out one of our very own interns on marketplace used to work at a grocery store so I'm gonna meet him and hear what he has to say the hair used to work in the industry what did you do with me that was past its best before day he gears up to give us a demo something like this they would take the dip it in blood just double it a little bit we've stimulated some blood here yeah so just double it like that and then as you can see it looks a lot redder that's what you do you would take the brown meat and turn it red yeah so we would turn it red and then if like again we do it as many times as possible we just keep flipping it when it comes to our third question what's happening in the meat department we here doing meet make over it's easy we would rewrite them and put down a new sticker which came with a new best before date that I extended the shelf life and you won't look at ground beef the same when you hear this if it's really bad if it's like this we would dabble in a little bit of blood throw it into the meat mincer with some redder meats and then altogether it would make it look red and then we put it back up on the shelf and people would buy this yeah yeah all the time sounds misleading but can it be risky to food safety expert Keith Warner helps us recreate what we've heard is going on with meat we mix meat that's four days past its best before date with new how does it smell I'll let you do the honors - good let's do good turn it on so how's this new blend look it's totally fresh likes well disguised yeah that looks good but could it be bad for you we send it off for testing the good the bad and the rotten we go to the core and a best-before a flashback it didn't look right and it didn't taste right did our coffee-cups investigation get your pot boiling find out what Tim Hortons and Starbucks staff have to say this is your marketplace ready set it's a time bomb flashback 1976 funky fondue a few weeks ago mrs. Rita Clifford of Sudbury Ontario served a cheese fondue to her husband and their guests the fondue was quite frankly awful it didn't look right and it didn't taste right this is Clifford complained to the manufacturer and she got her money back another satisfied consumer end of story not quite Joan's mrs. Clifford also received some interesting information the fondue mix she bought was over three years old the lounge's company has not been making fondue mix for almost four years and the ideal shelf life of the mix would have been under a year so next we call the Toronto office of the TJ Lipton company as they handle the marketing of Blanche's products and Lipton's branch manager and you all about mrs. Clifford's failed fondue party but he didn't feel it could happen again and in fact he jokingly remarked I'll bet you $1,000 you couldn't find another package of the stuff well we went to forest stores in Toronto and three out of four had the mix to Loblaws in the Dominion and we figure that branch manager owes us about three thousand dollars great that was then this is now and we're finding some grocery stores are still playing games when it comes to best before dates would you eat this past the best before date no fruit what we're about to show you next might just change the way you shock food safety expert Keith Warner is helping us test some foods insiders tell us are being doctored to extend their shelf life like grinding up meat that's four days past its best before date with fresh yuck I'm curious how it tested so what we found was the meat was actually loaded with bacteria after only one day it was loaded with these type of bacteria called entra bacteria see and what they do this is that these can break down the meat proteins to make something called biogenic amines which are toxic chemicals which can cause asthma mood changes all sorts people who bought that me wouldn't know that it was spoiled because it been mixed up with the good-looking me exactly was deception at its worst isn't it taupey unethical and in this case ok if he goes beyond ethics doesn't it goes just safety and things like that the hair has experience working in the grocery bills others we hear from he says mixing old meat with new happened all the time who told you to do this so the the butcher and my supervisor or a lot of times he'd bring it in for me he'd bring him like a stack of like like meats that were brown slam them onto him be like sahara unwrap these and relateable them stock them back up on the shelves so what advice does he wish he could have given his customers don't buy from the front of the shelves reach on behind grab this stuff in the back that stuff is usually a little newer back on the street we tell people about all that meat tampering that's disgusting oh my god look that's their bike do you buy marinated meats am i like marinated fish do you consider it fresh yes I always think it's more fresh it's like you like they prepared in the store that day see I put my trust and company might not be fresh it's not good so can you trust marinated meat we hear from other insiders including this Ontario grocery manager he says there's a secret reason some stores are adding sauces and spices to meat we've got some marinated drumsticks here why is stuff marinated things get marinated if it's if it's going off or it is off they will marinate it to hide the odor and if there are any dark spots or whatever to mask that and then put it out for sale and things that are marinade to actually sell for more you charge more for no stuff that has gone past its best before date yes was referred to as value-added so because you're adding something to it it increases the price so in our store things like steaks strip loin steaks they were going off they were expired essentially would be coated in some sort of barbecue marinade or cracked pepper something with a really strong odor to hide the rotten smell what was the reason given for doing this it's all about profit and money and the health of the consumer is not really concern it's how much money I can make with almost ten years experience in the biz this insiders got a tip for the next time you're out shopping for meat I would not buy a pre marinated meat or pre spiced meat in grocery stores because you don't know what has happened to it it could be fresh but it could also be expired product what tends to happen according to some insiders the marinated needs it's often marinated to kind of disguise the color hide the odor disgusting it's a fraud oh no I always just thought it would be the most freshman yeah earlier aha you should be honest with your consumer you want action we want answers Canadians want to be able to trust when they go to the grocery store that they're buying food that is safe for them get our newsletter your cheat sheet to the news you need to eat or not to eat you don't want to miss this ready to engage we're getting the goods on best before date insiders from coast to coast tell us they're tampering with your food store policies are being ignored final question when you see mold on food can you cut it off and eat the rest I think so hell no far as I know you can cut it off I still you microbiologist Keith Warner says it's not as simple as you might think if you see mold growing on a product is that safe to eat in things like bread it's safe but if you think of a soft cheese if you think of jam if you think of even a strawberry and you see these moles growing they could potentially reducing these toxins that diffuse through but this former grocery manager says old fruits and veggies sometimes get a second life any time you needed to make a fruit tray you might go out onto the counter and see what's out there maybe something is starting to turn and you would bring it back in and cut off the part that is bad and then cut up the rest that looks good and then put it into a fruit tray did you actually see that happening yes I did same thing happens with some vegetables so it happens quite often okay what if I told you that hard food products like orange cauliflower or broccoli there's mold on it it's okay to eat but when we're talking about soft foods don't even take a chance no I didn't know that before I have actually cut strong mold off strawberries and fennyman so I didn't realize that shut the front door misleading people about best before dates is illegal there are industry standards for best before dates stores are supposed to self-police so there's no way of knowing how widespread these practices are not every grocery worker who answered our call out had stories to share but 1/3 of people who worked in the industry in the past 10 years the tampering was going on no surprise to retired public health inspector Jim Cham what kind of stories have you heard about altering best before dates I've been receiving complaints from the public regarding you know when I buy a pill you know a product on it looks like somebody change or cover they are the best before date all people would say that looks like somebody change it by using a pen or did you smudge it all those things people were questioning whether they've been tampered with it does correct he's been hearing about food tampering for over 30 years how do you know those things are actually happening where often that we would do a spot check go to the meat counter or the food package counter right away and just to do the best to see whether those evidence can be collected yep it's often hard to catch in the act so who is minding the store we try for weeks to get an interview with the industry group the retail Council of Canada but they won't talk on camera so with test results in hand we pay them a visit hi there I'm Erika Johnson from CBC Marketplace hoping to see David Wilkes David Wilkes is the senior vice president of the retail councils grocery division we wait and wait finally he comes out to speak with us what specifically are you going to do now that we've told you people are tampering with best of four dates there's a risk here that people could get sick right I don't accept that the products that were changed or altered or there was issues around that there was safety concerns good employees are telling us that they're being told from the top down to fudge the best before dates it's coming from managers often right and so I don't accept that premise Canadians are going to be able to trust when they go to the grocery store that they're buying food that is safe for them they can trust the the quality of the food that is in Canadian stores they can trust the food safety if we've discovered that people are being told to fudge best before dates what steps have you taken to mediate that the steps were already in place the steps were in place being followed we asked Wilkes if he'll pass on a message to his members you know a commitment to us today will you commit to getting back to your member stores and telling them they have to enforce the policies that are already in place because obviously that's not happening I don't need to do that because those policies are already in place they're worse than nd I do not be followed in we agree to disagree that was interesting he heard our concerns and he said that basically these policies are being followed in stores it's not what we found so what message do you have for retailers as a mother as a light we are putting our trust in you so please help us you should be honest with your consumer I would say any company tampering with best before dates don't do it it's not worth my help your favorite fish oil or protein powder really any good for you dietary supplements a capsule of prevention or a dose of height they're out there saying take this will be a complete man a complete woman more than half of this protein is spiked they're basically cheating the customers fish oil or snake oil none of the seven products that we tested met their label

23,0,The Secrets of Sugar - the fifth estate,"We’ve heard for years about the dangers of eating too much fat or salt. But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate’s season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science — and the reaction from the food industry — to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?A small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer’s.We put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists – and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.Original airdate : October 4th, 2013For more on the fifth estate : http://www.cbc.ca/fifthFollow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/cbcfifthLike us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/thefifthestate",CBC News,K3ksKkCOgTw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

25,1,What does it take to maintain Singapore's Jewel Changi Airport? | Jewel After Hours | Full Episode,"Jewel Changi Airport is Singapore's newest tourism attraction. The sprawling 135,700 sqm complex, with its heady mix of nature and architecture, retail and restaurants, has garnered considerable accolades from local fans and international press alike. Behind the beautiful flora and majestic waterfall and under its gleaming facade, who are the people keeping Jewel polished? Filmed mostly at night, Jewel After Hours takes a peek behind Changi’s newest gem. Meet the people who work behind-the-scenes, often into the wee hours, to maintain Singapore's latest icon. Through their stories, we will reveal what the island nation has in store for travellers in the coming years.==================================#CNA #CNADocumentaries #Singapore #Jewel #ChangiAirportSubscribe to our channel here: https://cna.asia/youtubesubSubscribe to our news service on Telegram: https://t.me/cnalatestFollow us:CNA: https://cna.asiaCNA Lifestyle: http://www.cnalifestyle.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasiaInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/channelnews...Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia",CNA,d2CoZQcRJ14,"['My childhood days\n were spent in a village at the foothills of Mount Faber. There was only one TV\n in the whole village, and nobody watched TV. We spent our days\n either swimming in a canal, climbing fruit trees\n to gather rambutans, or catching spiders. I think that\'s where I first developed\n my love for the outdoors. Jewel, for me, is like\n travelling back to my childhood. I get to do the things that I did\n as a young boy playing outdoors, looking after plants\n and looking for insects, looking after the nature\n that’s in Jewel. Today, I have the entire outdoors\n in an indoor setting. That is really very fulfilling. In the wee hours at night, we still have\n concierge teams roaming around. What happens at night is that\n we’d look out for arrival guests, guests who are lost,\n who need our help. We also look out for guests\n who are sleeping. Yes, we need to check on them\n from time to time, so that they do not\n miss their respective flights. Excuse me. The guests in the day time\n are much more active. They have a lot more questions\n and enquiries, as compared to the guests at night\n who are much more sleepy. Usually, they won\'t ask so many\n questions at that time of the night. After hours, when our\n concierge counter is closed, if we find a lost item, we\'ll hand it over to our Jewel operations\n manager, who will file a \'found\' report. Mostly, we\'d find gadgets\n like laptops, iPads, and in particular, cell phones. When I was at Level 2 North,\n I found a wallet. There was around $700\n inside the wallet, and the guest was very happy\n that I found the wallet. People think that Jewel\n is very quiet at night. And yes, we do have\n fewer crowds in the evening. But in the wee hours, there\'s actually\n a lot of activities that are still going on. For example, the maintenance team is still\n servicing and cleaning our Rain Vortex and other attractions in Jewel. There’s also the landscaping team who is working on\n our landscaping features. For us, Jewel actually\n comes alive after 10pm because the work that we have to do,\n taking care of the plants, has to happen after visitors\n have left the garden. It\'s almost as if the garden\n is alive 24 hours. When everybody else is asleep, we come to life\n and start maintaining the plants, making sure everything is good\n for the next day. We break into small teams. A group of people does the pruning, some people handle\n the insect spraying, and some handle the plant washing. Spray it evenly, make sure all parts of\n the fern column get the water. We don’t want excessive water\n on one side. Spread it out evenly. To date, Jewel has been receiving,\n on average, 250,000 to 300,000 daily visitors. That number continues to grow. If you look through your Instagram Stories,\n Facebook feed, social media, you’ll definitely see our hero shots, our Shiseido Forest Valley\n and our HSBC Rain Vortex. These are the two attractions\n that people will definitely come for. The HSBC Rain Vortex\n light-and-sound show will be starting soon. Before every light-and-sound show, we will do what we call\n the pre-show checks. This is to make sure\n all the equipment and systems that are supposed to be running\n are functioning correctly. What we do is make sure the pump\n is running within the normal range. This is to ensure that there is\n sufficient water flow to the acrylic skin. This is our main water tank. This is where\n all the water collects. So from Basement 3, the water will\n be pumped all the way up to Level 5. Many people may not know this, but the waterfall water itself\n is actually treated, so it’s very clean. People come from all over Singapore,\n and even from foreign countries, to view this unique and iconic feature\n that Jewel has to offer. We have to deliver at our end, to make sure that the guests get to enjoy\n the full light-and-sound show. Before the show, the team and I will go down to the site to do the pre-show checks. Are the projectors turned on? We make sure that\n all the speakers are turned on too. We make sure all the pumps\n are in working condition. Sometimes, the WiFi connection has\n a glitch, so we have to manage that. We have to find\n the proper connection. This iPad controls the Rain Vortex\n and the things that go with it, like the fog, the lights, and all that. When I was handed the iPad,\n it stayed with me at all times. Wherever I went, whatever I did,\n it was always by my side. It’s more important\n than my mobile phone. This iPad really is\n my precious baby. The Rain Vortex system was created\n by an American consultancy, WET Design. In the beginning, the American\n consultant was the only one who could hold this iPad\n and operate it. So Alex and I had to work with them. We had to gain their trust over\n the course of two to three months before they actually allowed us\n to touch the iPad and control the\n Rain Vortex operations. The first day we held this iPad… I still remember the day,\n it was 13 April. Alex and I, along with the consultant\n from WET, were walking on Level 5, and the consultant felt the urge\n to go to the toilet, for some reason. That was when he handed over\n the iPad to us, an unofficial handover. When he passed us the iPad,\n both of us felt very excited and we ended up taking a selfie. Yes, everything looks fine. The light-and-sound show\n will run as scheduled. During the show,\n two teams will be deployed. One will be at the Forest Valley,\n observing the show. The other team will be down below, making sure the servers\n and systems stay online and are not faulty. People think of the Rain Vortex\n as just a waterfall, but actually, there are\n many more elements to it, such as the lighting,\n the background music, the speakers as well as projectors. These are things which the public\n won’t normally notice, but to our trained eyes,\n this is what we look out for. If everything goes well and runs smoothly,\n we can go home and sleep easy, knowing that we have\n done our jobs properly. When I first joined,\n Jewel was still under construction. There wasn\'t any waterfall, so it didn\'t really impress me\n at that point in time. But once they started to do\n the testing and commissioning, when they started\n to run the water feature, that was when it really struck me,\n and I thought, “This is magnificent!” For me, Jewel during the day\n is all about running the operations. But at night, I get this feeling\n of serenity and calmness because of its ambience. At night, it’s much more peaceful. You really get to enjoy\n the tranquillity of this place because it\'s designed\n to be like a forested area. We really get to be one with nature. Much of the work starts\n when it’s close to midnight. I want you to trim those\n that are slightly out of shape. It’s time for the olive tree\n to be given a nice haircut. One of the things that really\n left an impression on us was the planting of the olive trees. That whole night, it took us six hours\n just to plant two trees because we didn\'t want any of the limbs\n or branches of the trees to break. And then, hauling them up\n from Level 1 to Level 5 was a very slow and painful process. It was a painful task. It took us a long time\n because we wanted to get it right, down to the smallest details like\n positioning the trees in such a way that gives people the best angle\n for viewing them. Here in Jewel, we have around\n 2,200 trees and palms, 100,000 shrubs from\n around 120 different species. To source for the plants, we went\n as far as Australia, Florida, Spain, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. We’ve some interesting ficus plants\n called “Ficus snake form”. We got them from China. We were travelling from\n one nursery to another, and along the way,\n we saw these beautiful plants. It was never in the planting plan,\n so we thought we\'d just get them first, and later, we would decide\n where they fit in the garden. It turned out very well, and they\n fit beautifully in the Canopy Park. We are now inside\n the water skin of the Rain Vortex. This is a view of Jewel\n that not many people get to see. As with all water features, people tend to make their \'wishing well\'\n wishes and throw coins into the fountain. Whenever we find coins, we will just\n put them aside for safekeeping. You need to be here at night\n to experience this. It’s very peaceful. You really have time to observe\n the Rain Vortex in its true beauty. There’s no one obstructing the view,\n so you really get to see how the Rain Vortex\n is such a complex system, and yet, it is so beautiful. As Experience Rangers,\n we manage the day-to-day operations of all the attractions\n here on Level 5. After the park closes, we will do a\n thorough check on all of the attractions, such as the Mirror Maze. We have to check and make sure\n that there are no cracks in the mirrors, the area is clean, and the lights and sound effects\n are all working. We just want to make sure that\n it\'s good for the next day’s operations. We’ll also do a thorough check\n of the Hedge Maze. We check for overgrown plants that may be jutting too far out\n into the pathway. If there are any, we’ll need to notify\n the landscape team to trim them. We have the walking nets here. We will check all the ropes, make sure there are\n no sharp wires sticking out, and make sure all the\n metal components are in place. My first experience on the nets\n was pretty scary. The moment I reached the peak and\n looked down, it caused me to freeze up. Luckily, I had a friend with me\n who guided me through it. I wouldn\'t have made it to the end,\n if it was not for him. Most guests seem\n very confident at the start. But the moment they start to look down,\n and this is five storeys high, many would just stand still\n and refuse to go down. The Experience Rangers here\n are actually quite used to it, so they will offer them\n a helping hand. I once encountered a lady who,\n right from the start, was crawling because she was too scared. So I went over to her\n and as we got closer to the end, I saw a guy filming us. She said, “That\'s my husband!\n He left me on my own here.” Her husband was also\n too scared to help her, so luckily, I was there for her. When I was a kid, I liked to\n spend my time at the playground because that\'s where\n all the neighbourhood kids were. That was our hangout spot. My childhood playground had a net, so in a way, I get to relive\n some of my memories here. Working here at a giant playground\n makes me feel like a kid again because I get to play\n without people judging me, without anyone asking,\n “What\'s a grown-up doing at a playground?” We check the safety of the slides but at the same time, it\'s also an excuse\n to enjoy ourselves a little. After the park closes,\n when it\'s much quieter, sometimes, I will just spend a few minutes\n watching the planes take off and land, which, I think, is a pretty nice way\n to end the day. The difference between\n day and night flights is that we are a little busier\n on day flights and we get to interact\n with more passengers, while night flights are a little quieter\n and more tranquil. I am a very active person\n and I like freedom. As an air stewardess, flying allows me to be at\n different places at different times, and on top of that,\n I get to interact with a lot of people across different cultures. One time, my colleagues and I\n were on board the Skytrain. When the Skytrain went through\n the Forest Valley in Jewel, we came across the Rain Vortex. Some travellers in the Skytrain\n asked us what that was, and as it was also our first time seeing it,\n we were all in awe too. We burst out laughing because\n our reaction time was so slow. It took us around\n three or five seconds before we turned around\n to answer the travellers and tell them what it was\n that we just saw. After long periods of travelling,\n flying for over 10 hours, when we see the lights\n of Singapore and the airport, it feels really good\n to be back home. When the captain announces\n for us to prepare for arrival, it means coming back home\n to our loved ones, and getting to enjoy\n our own local delights. Having travelled so often, I’ve come to appreciate the simple things\n that we have in Singapore. I remember that when I was young, the Marina Square area was mostly sea,\n but now, look at the skyline. When you see it, you\'d think,\n ""Singapore has really evolved and changed over the years."" I think that at the heart of it, that\'s what Singapore\n is really known for. We reinvented\n what a garden should be. With Jewel, we reinvented\n what an airport could be. The travel and tourism landscape\n continues to evolve. Travellers are becoming\n increasingly discerning. They know what they want. They go out, look for, and discover\n all these hidden gems, to really get to know\n the destination. And there\'s always something new\n to love and discover about Singapore. Singapore by day\n and Singapore by night. Sometimes, it’s two completely\n different destinations. Beyond your bars and clubs at night, it\'s also a great place\n for families at night. There was the\n Singapore Night Festival. At Little India, there was\n the Little India Art Walk. From day to night time, you\'ll definitely find something\n that you love to do here in Singapore. When we started planning Jewel, we were very clear that we wanted it\n to be a tourism product. We wanted to put it\n on the global map. We wanted it to be a place where... If you\'re a tourist from afar, you\'d want to come to Singapore\n because you\'ve heard of this place. And I think we\'re really overwhelmed\n by the positive response. We never expected to have\n so many followers on Instagram, although social media\n is the thing of today. People always ask me,\n “So, you should have a lot of pictures?” And the irony is,\n if you look through my phone, when I do have pictures,\n they\'re along the lines of... “Look, this thing is crooked,”\n or “Why is the tree leaning?” It’s all about what we need to fix. So I end up having\n not-so-nice pictures of Jewel. Now that Jewel is complete,\n and I have less troubleshooting to do, there are more opportunities\n to take better pictures. I saw all the social media pictures\n of Jewel before I went, so I have to say that\n my expectations were pretty high when I first went to Jewel. And yet, upon seeing it up close, seeing it for myself\n with my own eyes, I was still very impressed. Singapore has always prided itself\n on being a garden city. Jewel is sort of like\n the climax of that. We want visitors\n coming into Singapore and leaving Singapore\n to have this image, that they have stepped\n into a garden city. The question I get asked most often is,\n “Are the plants real?” I think it’s because\n people are so surprised. They’re wondering, “How did they\n manage to get so much greenery into an indoor environment?” This reminds me of my childhood days\n when I’d catch spiders, just for the fun of it. But actually,\n I am now looking for pests. You can see some mealybugs which is quite common\n on indoor plantings. When the team of architects\n first presented the idea for Jewel, and they showed us these beautiful\n renderings of the landscape and all, I thought to myself,\n “Either these guys are joking or everybody here is crazy.” To be very frank,\n I thought it was near impossible because the biggest challenge\n for growing plants indoor has always been light. We need to get\n the light levels correct. The key to that was choosing\n the correct glass type, a glass that allows maximum light in but cuts out the radiant heat. The Jewel glass facade\n is very interesting. It comprises more than 9,000\n different glass panels and each of them is of\n different dimensions. So each panel is special.\n It has three glass layers. It keeps the heat out,\n lets the sunlight in, and allows the plants to thrive. Cleaning such a\n complex glass structure requires a lot coordination\n with different parties. More importantly, the people cleaning this\n have to do it quadrant by quadrant, and work their way downwards. Currently, our projects team is\n doing the internal facade cleaning. As you can see, there\'re many glass panels\n and they have to clean it one by one. It gets quite tedious. It has to be done on a regular basis\n in order to keep the place shiny. A lot of the cleaning\n has to be done at night because that\'s when\n the crowd level comes down. That includes the cleaning\n of periodic works, such as high dusting, cleaning those light fittings\n that cannot be tackled during the day. You also have escalator cleaning, and of course,\n let’s not forget toilet cleaning. We have to do a thorough\n cleaning of all the toilets. The attractions that are interesting\n to clean are the Mirror Maze, the Canopy Bridge,\n as well as the Sky Nets. The one that\'s challenging is the Sky Nets\n because there are three layers of nets. It’s a challenge to retrieve the items\n or the dried leaves caught in between the nets. The Mirror Maze can\n only be cleaned at night, when the lighting is low\n and the park is closed. At times, you might walk into a mirror. Now, I am cleaning the Mirror Maze, and getting rid of finger marks. When I first started cleaning\n the Mirror Maze, I lost track of the way out as I was trying to spot and clean\n every single finger mark. After three days, once I overcame\n the challenges of the place, it no longer posed a problem for me. Our central kitchen starts\n really early in the morning. We start at 2am,\n before anyone is up. We make all our kueh,\n each one is individually handmade. They are handcrafted into\n these tiny little delicacies. We have to make sure that whatever\n we make is real and authentic, and that\'s why we still\n want to do it by hand. Our ondeh ondeh\n is still done by hand, our kueh dadar is still\n individually hand-rolled, our kueh lapis is still hand-layered, layer by layer. That\'s why we start at 2am. It\'s to make sure that\n the best and freshest products go out to our outlets\n all over Singapore. Our first trip out of the\n central kitchen is at about 8am, and then throughout the day,\n we continue to make the kuehs, and as the kuehs are done,\n they get sent out island-wide, from Jurong all the way to Changi,\n and of course, that includes Jewel. Our store at Jewel\n is our flagship store. We try to make it a little different by using elements of\n Peranakan floral motifs. We’ve also used batik\n because that\'s part of our heritage. About one and a half to two hours. We also have a\n demonstration counter. At this counter, you can see how\n our kueh lapis is made, layer by layer, one layer at a time. That’s something that\'s a bit unique. Keep compressing it down, be sure to make it even,\n so that it is flat. Yes, it takes a lot of time. When Bengawan Solo started in 1979,\n 40 years ago, we already have\n our pandan chiffon. We’d get tourists from China,\n Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even Japan. They’d come here and would want\n to get something that\'s truly local, so they’d get a pandan chiffon cake. Travellers who come to our Jewel store\n to buy something from us… What we sell at our store here\n is exactly what you’ll find at our stores in Ang Mo Kio\n or Toa Payoh. It’s really what Singaporeans and locals\n have been eating for generations. Food is an enormous part\n of Singapore\'s culture, partly because we\'re immigrants. In those days, when people migrated,\n it was due to hunger, famine, or floods. And to be able to eat well\n was a sign of success. Everyone in Singapore\n is a connoisseur. I think you\'ll experience this\n even when you ride a taxi. The taxi driver is equally a gourmet and can tell you exactly\n how this fish is steamed. I think that\'s amazing to many people\n from around the world. I think that for Singaporeans,\n food is actually the ties that bind. We have a photo wall that showcases\n our history and food culture. Along this section,\n which is very interesting, we have the chefs who are known as the “Four Heavenly\n Kings of Singapore food”. They came together\n to create yu sheng, which is our famous\n Singaporean raw fish dish for Chinese New Year celebrations. And here is my aunt, my\ue000 Mak Koh, teaching you how to pound\n while wearing a sarong kebaya, doing it in a very elegant way. In the old days,\n a potential mother-in-law will visit the homes of girls\n of marriageable age in the mornings, and listen to the pounding, to determine if the girl can cook. If she cannot pound,\n it means she cannot cook, and therefore,\n is unsuitable for my son. We do feel a sense of pride\n in being at Jewel. It is so important\n because this is the airport, which is a gateway\n for people to visit us. We want to offer a taste\n of some local Malay dishes, so we have satay, and we have fish curry,\n which originates from Little India. We are actually presenting\n the whole of Asia on the table. -Bon appétit.\n -Thank you. As a Singaporean,\n personally, I feel very proud that almost half of the brands here\n are Singapore brands. As Changi Airport and Jewel\n is such an international location, this is a good place to\n showcase these brands. “Singapore meets the world\n and the world meets Singapore” is a tagline that we\'ve\n always had for Jewel. One of the things that will really\n strike you, when you enter Jewel, is the lush greenery\n and the sound of the waterfall, as the water flows down\n from the Vortex. You see all this glass? The glass panels allow\n the natural light in during the day, so we don’t have to make use\n of additional energy to power the lighting\n within the dome. Obviously, we look at things\n from the perspective of users. We think of what they\n would like to feel and see when they come to\n such a beautiful place. If you walk around,\n you will see some robots that are located strategically\n around the mall. They serve you water and sweets. To us, they also serve as\n mini attractions. I am Peter. Every day, I patrol\n the drop-off point at Jewel. Whenever I spot immobile\n automobiles or loitering lorries, my job is to get them to move on. No obstructing traffic on my watch. My name is Yoji. If guests need a thirst quencher\n while staying at YOTELAIR, just give me a ring\n and I will come rolling along. Room service?\n More like robot service. Welcome to Jewel. Please select the \'stop\' button\n for a complimentary drink. And when anyone needs a cool-down\n or a pick-me-up at the Canopy Park, just stop me for some water\n and candy. With our robots,\n the minute they appear, you will see people taking photos\n and just crowding around them. To us, they are little stars. We do have a unique feature at Jewel, which is that our concierge team\n will actually perform. We have a colleague, Arvin,\n who is a magician. During our training, he told us that he loves to\n perform magic tricks as a hobby. So we encouraged him\n to showcase his talent on site. I just want you to say “Stop”.\n Whenever you want, just say “Stop”. -Stop!\n -Stop. Look at your card. Don’t show it to me,\n you can show it to your mum. Put it inside. -Okay, Mum, you can keep this.\n -Okay, Mummy will keep this. I need your palm. I\'m going\n to take a picture of your hands. This fellow is going to\n pick out your card. Okay? -Okay.\n -I will put this in. Look at this. -Oh my god!\n -Was this your card? This was your card, right? Yes. I\'ve been practising magic tricks\n since I was a teenager. I started practising\n when I was 12 or 13 years old. I watched a lot of David Blaine shows,\n street magic tricks and all that, so I became interested. When I come to work, I am so happy\n that I also get to do card tricks. Every day, I get to do this,\n so it’s not really a job. It’s a very good feeling to delight guests\n while doing magic card tricks, and in turn,\n I feel twice as delighted. I want you to pick any card. You don\'t have to show it to me.\n Show it to them. I usually practise\n whenever I\'m free, such as during my breaks\n and after office hours. Whenever I can find the time,\n I will practise. To able to work and also indulge\n in my hobby, that\'s a great thing. I will never stop doing this. It wouldn’t be there\n because it is in my pocket. Oh my god, good job! This is a photo of my baby. This was taken during\n our preview for the public. I guess my baby was so amazed\n by the lights that were on display that he opened his mouth and kept staring at the lights\n for a good one minute. When I saw him open his mouth\n like that, I felt proud. I think I will keep showing him\n this photo as he grows up, to make sure he remembers it. When I first started\n my job at Jewel, my son was newly born,\n he was just 10 days old. I was also doing my\n part-time studies at the university. So a typical day for me would be\n to arrive at work at 8:30am, and my day would end\n around 12 midnight to 1am. Basically, that was the most tiring\n and painful time. It was hard at first. It was difficult being a first-time mum,\n and also, this is our first baby. So, not having him around at home\n was kind of tough. My wife, being a supportive wife, made a compromise\n and actually came over to the airport to have dinner with me, so that we could at least spend some time\n together in the course of the day. That was how I managed to balance\n my work with my family time. But at the end of the day,\n I felt that it was a good opportunity, and I was very happy\n that I was able to work through it. I think the unsung heroes\n in delivering this project have to be all the loved ones\n of the people in our team, the people around us who had to\n pick up the slack at home and really see us through\n the ups and downs. Those are the true unsung heroes. We refresh the garden every quarter, and the theme for this round\n is “Autumn”. So we will switch out the orchids\n in one of the orchid trees to fit in with the colours\n of the new season. We will change this first,\n it will take about three to four hours. Later, we will try to change this. Otherwise, we will tackle this tomorrow. In the weeks leading up\n to the opening, there were days when we\n had to work till 2am or 3am, as we had to make sure that\n everything was done correctly. I have a young daughter,\n under two years old. As I have to work nights at times, by the time I reach home,\n she will be fast asleep. So during the day, I will make sure\n that before I go to work, I get to spend some time with her. At least, I still get\n to see her every day. Luckily for me, I have very good\n support from my family. My mum is the main care-giver. This allows me to\n stay focused at work, knowing my daughter\n is in good hands. On a daily basis, I will walk around\n and check on all the trees. One of the trees that we have\n been monitoring is this tree. We have observed some browning\n on the tips of the leaves, so hopefully, it will recover soon. After we finished the O-level exams\n and received our results, my secondary school teacher,\n who was very nice, sat a few of us down. He told me that the landscaping industry\n would be a good fit for me. I was always very involved in sports and did a lot of outdoor activities. I was not a quiet sort of girl, so he felt that this would suit me. I guess I was a good girl. I listened to his advice\n and applied for the course, did my diploma, did my degree, and here I am, doing what I enjoy. Right now, we are preparing\n for Jewel\'s grand opening which is happening\n in two days’ time. We are expecting\n close to 700 guests to join us. Logistically, it has been\n quite a challenge because it’s the first time\n we are hosting an event within the Shiseido Forest Valley. Right now, we are on stage, and this where our launch\n mechanism is going to be. Our guest of honour,\n the Prime Minister, and our VIPs will be pressing a button\n during the ceremony. Jewel opened six months ago. But with a press of this button, it will\n mark the official opening of Jewel. One of the key highlights planned\n for the official opening ceremony is that we’ll try and surprise the guests by introducing a new\n light-and-sound show. It will revolve around a song that was\n written specially for this new show, and for the HSBC Rain Vortex. Dick Lee approached me\n and shared with me his ideas, his plan for the song that we\'ll write together. I have always been waiting\n for the right time and the opportunity to do\n something in Singapore, for Singapore to connect\n with the world, connecting different cultures and people. I was very much\n looking forward to it. We thought of the image\n of the Vortex and how it would come together\n with the light show. We wanted to write a song\n that could be epic but at the same time, very intimate. We will be unveiling\n a new light-and-sound show for Jewel’s opening ceremony. We are doing the final fine-tuning. I can’t tell you about it now because\n it\'s a secret and surprise for everyone. On the day itself, I will be the one who\'s responsible\n for launching the show. It\'s a lot of pressure. We opened Jewel\n to the public in April. Then we had the second phase\n of the Canopy Park opening in June. And now, we have the official\n opening ceremony in October. It\'s a ceremonious occasion. It is, in essence, a celebration\n of what everyone has achieved. Jewel’s official opening, to me, is like the opening in April\n all over again. The preview period\n was definitely challenging. We all worked around the clock. We had to stay at YOTELAIR just so\n we could catch some sleep in between. During the preview week, we saw an estimated 600,000 visitors\n over seven days. Imagine having 100,000 people come to the mall on a daily basis. It’s intense. The bins would be filled up\n every 15 minutes, and our crew had to, literally,\n run around with bin liners and get the bins emptied\n as quickly as possible before they overflowed. The first few days after\n Jewel’s opening were really hectic. There were long queues at\n many of the shops and restaurants. Likewise, during\n the light-and-sound show, there were big crowds\n around the Rain Vortex. Many of the travellers\n shared with me that they had flown to Singapore\n just to see the opening of Jewel. At the very first light-and-sound show\n for the public, this was where\n we were watching it from. I still can’t forget that day. I was standing on Level 5 with Alex. We were watching\n the show from there. Before the day of the preview, we were still fine-tuning\n the light-and-sound show. The first show at 7:30pm... was the first perfect show\n that we ever got. Both of us were very nervous, and both of us were praying that the first show for the public\n would go smoothly. The Forest Valley was\n really packed with people. In the end, everything\n went according to plan. After the show ended, people actually\n gave us a round of applause. I think it took us by surprise, but at the same time, it gave us\n a great sense of satisfaction. Set-up will continue through the night\n and into tomorrow. We will be having rehearsals,\n and after that, it\'s showtime. Today is the official opening of Jewel,\n and as you can see, we’ve already closed off the entire\n Forest Valley in preparation for it. Ladies and gentlemen,\n please put your hands together and warmly welcome our\n guest of honour this evening, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\n and Mrs Lee. Jewel has become one of the... instantly recognisable icons of Singapore. Every facet of it is brilliant. Singaporeans are proud of Jewel\n and rightly so. It resonates with us because it reminds us that when we\n dream big and apply ourselves, nothing is impossible. Ladies and gentlemen,\n for this historic countdown, may I invite you to join me, please. One, two, three! Who would have imagined that when we decided to shift our airport\n from Paya Lebar to Changi, that one day, we would make it\n the best airport in the world. May Jewel long continue to sparkle and bring joy to Singaporeans\n and visitors alike. I\'ve been hearing comments from\n my friends from other countries. They\'d say, ""I hear there\'s going to be\n this place in Singapore called \'Jewel\'."" When I saw it for myself,\n I was very excited because I felt that\n this is going to be a place that the whole world\n will want to visit, just to experience it. I think what\'s great about Jewel is that... it\'s also our airport. To me, I feel that\n it checks plenty of boxes, in terms of what Singapore rep",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
esents\n and what Singapore stands for. It\'s really enjoyed,\n not just by visitors, but also very much\n by Singaporeans themselves. I want to say that\n no other country’s citizens feel the same way about their airports\n as Singaporeans do. We\'ve always set out\n for Jewel to be a place where people can build\n fond memories. Jewel’s officially open! Cheers! I think the team that was\n involved in Jewel’s opening was definitely passionate\n and committed. The fact that today, it has become\n an icon that\'s symbolic of Singapore makes us all very proud. It’s a wrap! This is a picture of my parents. These are my mum, my dad,\n and my husband, who visited me when\n the Canopy Park first opened. One of the memorable things\n that I want to share is this moment when my parents\n came over to me and said, “I don\'t remember\n what you look like anymore. The only time I can see you is when\n I literally come to Changi Airport and meet you for dinner.” But after they came over\n and saw the opening, I think they were filled with pride. They then understood why I was putting\n so much time and effort into this. I was spending\n a lot of time at work, including many late nights\n in the Rain Vortex, working with the\n American consultant. My mum actually felt that I was\n spending much less time with her. When my mum first came to Jewel\n and saw the Rain Vortex, she finally understood\n what her son was working on, and she was proud of her son. That is me. When we first opened Jewel, friends whom I’ve lost contact with\n for the last 15, 20 years suddenly found me and said, “I saw your work at Jewel and\n I think it\'s fantastic.” That was nice. Jewel helped me\n to get back in touch with friends whom I’ve lost contact with\n for the last 15, 20 years. There\'s a gynaecologist\n whom I see from time to time. Every time I see her, she will say, “You know, I am so proud of you. I\'m going to tell my other patients that I know the girl who does\n the landscaping in Jewel.” I think she is really\n very proud of me. One of the comments\n that I remember vividly was about feeling very proud\n to be Singaporean, that Jewel has become\n an icon to the world, and that the team behind Jewel\n did a good job. Seeing comments like that\n makes me feel that... all the late nights at Jewel\n are worth it. The official opening ceremony\n definitely feels like one milestone, like it marks the end of\n all the openings that we\'ve had. But it also feels like\n the next chapter. It\'s time to decide on the attractions\n that we want to refresh. It\'s time to plan\n the first Christmas, and before long,\n the first anniversary. It\'s just the first chapter\n of the book. The consultants and architects\n have done their part to help us realise this dream, and now," it is up to the team and me\n to carry the baby forward. It is not going to be easy. It\'s going to be very challenging.\n We look forward to it. Every day is going to be\n a different day.']""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was Central Asia's cradle of culture for more than two millennia whose Becca Stan home to a storied history and a wealth of architectural wonders from days of old but it's modern history is far less romantic for sixty years whose Becca Stan had been closed to the world first as a secret military research base under the Soviet Union and later as a hermit State under an authoritarian government it was only in 2017 when things changed Rebecca Stan today is our conducting very serious reforms I can even compare that with Chinese historical periods when they had the opening up a new president has taken over whose Becca Stan is now open for business and the money is pouring in leading the charge is China who want Wu's Becca Stan in on its belt and road master plan spectacular plans are underway for a Silk Road of cereals you're hoping to make China your biggest market bitch yes along with ambitious plans to transform some of the oldest and most mysterious cities on the Silk Road will Central Asia once again be the center of global trade a Belton Road initiative linking China and Russia has sparked celebration and concern rival powers Russia and China Russia and with China Russia or China in my journey along the road to Russia I'll visit China's border cities with Russia this entire city is Linton goal should be shoot baby shoot all 40 papa I'll discover the splendors Mongolia with its untapped riches mysterious Uzbekistan - it's stunning cities and I'll explore the Kremlin and the power it wheels this is my journey through one of China's key economic corridors on its belton Road [Music] I'm in the Far West of Uzbekistan in Central Asia and around me for 650 kilometers is desert in every direction over here the great ships of the desert are the camels it was these magnificent animals that carry treasure east to west on the ancient Silk Road along this mighty trading route China sent paper making technology to the Arab world and in turned receive Islam cotton and Buddhism traveled east from India to China and silk was carried thousands of kilometers in these deserts to reach Rome man it must have not been easy for the travelers back then because these camels have a mind of their own come on let's go there we go good job boy all right I hope you have insurance of course there wasn't any insurance in those days and many traveling traders didn't survive those long difficult trips but those who did profited handsomely the ancient Silk Road was the very first form of globalization in action and it was Becca Stan saw plenty of that action the country boasted some of the most important cities in the route and here's one of them Bukhara bukhara was a great trading City 2,500 years ago it offered water and shelter to weary travelers going to and from China and a thriving market for which to trade and I couldn't have picked a better time to come [Music] this is the bucura silk and spices festival an annual event celebrating book auras ancient Silk Road links people of all ages come out to celebrate their folk songs and traditional dances all of these costumes and performances we're seeing now we're already in existence on the ancient Silk Road so I can imagine that if you came here thousands of years ago you'd enter the city and be blown away by all the exotic colors and sounds [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] the city may be ancient but its people are young in this country 60% of the population is below the age of 30 and parties are lively affairs everybody seems to be in high spirits [Music] in the past traders from China heading to Europe pass through the city on caravans loaded with silks and spices they came to meet the city's master craftsmen with experts on pottery embroidery carpets and more the city was also famous for its blacksmith's bukhara and knives were legendary for their extra sharp blades they were handy deterrence against bandit raids a common feature on any Silk Road expedition these would have fetched a princely sum back in those early days of global trade the traders have long stopped coming they've since been replaced by tourists one group of tourists in particular stand out are you and I got a good walk wait see do you know what I got to wear how it's you [Laughter] since the launch of the belt and road initiative there's been a surge in tourism in many ancient Silk Road cities all thanks to the Chinese who are promoting the Silk Road in earnest hey so your Mandarin is pretty good huh they walk way tank jongwan one side I see I see higher higher words like my mom - it's chilly in here and the quando na bein my Mandarin is terrible oh so why did you study Mandarin a lot of tourists from China is coming and there are a few people who speak Chinese in Uzbekistan is studying Mandarin popular among your peers yes so a lot of people now are going to China to study and we have in Uzbekistan to Confucius University's so where the people go and attend Chinese classes are there more Chinese tourists coming here now yes this last two three years like a lot of Chinese people are coming to this Pakistan because you know all the cities of Uzbekistan are very like ancient and they are in the Silk Route so that's why they come here to visit so tourism dollars coming in from China that's got to be good for you yes of course I can start my own business fantastic good luck with that thank you yeah right tourism is a major industry in Uzbekistan and it is not just young whose backs getting primed for the Chinese wave hi Camille nice to meet you nice to meet you welcome what a beautiful place you have thank you let me show you around oh I'd love to see the rest of it let me show you our beautiful 19th century dining room oh man this Wow so this is 19th century yeah this is original 19th century dining room it stayed untouched for more than hundred years so here always used to be parties who is the original owner of this the house was built for each merchant he used to trade watches in cou look I'm sure you have to do some repair work from time to time to that but we are going to keep as it is so the people can feel the atmosphere nowadays a lot of business going on with Chinese companies and big companies small companies and of course when the people coming to work here they want to show the country where they're working they will bring all like families and relatives and friends you know today we hear a lot about the New Silk Road in global media how has that impacted old Silk Road cities like bukhara sure I think that the more more and more people will come to the Bekaa Stan because it's a more publicity about the Silk Road in the last three or four years because it's a big publicity about the Silk Road about Rebecca Stan and more and more visitors from China visiting our country do you have plans to cater to the Chinese tours I think we will hire the person who will speak Chinese and we probably will translate our web page to the Chinese language China's Silk Road is accelerating change in Central Asia and change has come not just from tourism alone Central Asia in the minds of the Chinese is the buckle of the belton road and many industries here are being transformed how important in Central Asia to the overall Belton Road initiative I think if we look at the map we can find out the importance of the Central Asia in API because it would be the first to stop for China to go out from China on the zone of the earth belt and also Central Asia region is a very very important area not only for Chinese economy especially for Chinese our security what's best and I still need to was a very important country in Central Asia and also what's biggest an has a breaking the relations with China and also post with Russia so I think it'll be okay but very very important there is a more important dynamics for China's washer and a regional peace and development it's not just the ancient cities that are changing Tashkent the country's capital is also getting a makeover I'm headed there on a high-speed train from tiny oasis town in the second century BC to Tashkent a thriving modern metropolis with two and a half million residents this place is now Central Asia's biggest city [Music] there is a legend that Tashkent was halfway between China where all the silk was coming from and Europe its destination Tashkent is the seat of government and Soviet architecture is evident everywhere that's because whose Becca Stein was part of the Soviet Union up until 1991 on that year the Soviet Union broke apart and Islam Karimov became president of the newly independent country but his rule of more than two decades was marred by allegations of corruption and human rights abuses activists were locked up whose becca stan was relatively closed to the rest of the world kerimov died in 2016 and now the new administration is trying to do things differently a five-year plan has been put in place to turbocharge the economy that has been stagnant for years now the excitement can even be felt in the marketplaces here at a carnival a man is about to lift the 300 kilogram camel with his teeth the strongman is ambitious so too is loose Becca stands new government [Music] [Applause] the government announced its five-year plan in 2017 the plan is around five different areas and those areas of course are covering a wide range of issues starting from the political system reform and finishing with the economy social life and others are you confident it can be achieved of course I would be honest with you as a citizen of Uzbekistan two and a half years ago I wasn't a member of the government yet but I was rather skeptical or cautious about whether we would be able to achieve all those goals but nowadays I'm very optimistic Pakistan today is conducting very serious reforms and I can even compare that with my Japanese or Chinese historical periods when they had the opening up so so we are in a quite historical moment right now the new plan together with China's belt and Road initiative is expected to bring monumental changes to the country not only has the Uzbek government signed some 15 billion u.s. dollars worth of investment deals on jointly developing the country's oil gas and uranium fields the two governments also agreed to cooperate in building railways road networks telecommunications infrastructure and industrial parks Chinese our major trade partner at the moment and of course when we are talking about investments especially foreign direct investments China is also number one whose Becca Stan has captured the world's attention this is the largest underdeveloped Central Asia market in Central Asia still 70% of the investments go to Kazakhstan and being as Pakistan second with 16% but and nowadays Pakistan is becoming one of the big players because of the first of all we have the one of the biggest markets the most dense country in the region and with 32 million population of course it's a big market for investors a few years ago foreign journalists like myself wouldn't even have been allowed to work here but now the country is welcoming to both media and business you can feel it in the air the country is on the cusp of change and it's an exciting time to be here I'm traveling on China's Silk Road in Uzbekistan and this is the capital city Tashkent one major aspect of China Silk Road arts railroads China has built railways across the world and here in Uzbekistan yet another ambitious rail connection will soon be underway but before I head to the new railway there's an old rail system I must see man look at this metro station whose Becca Stan has a proud history when it comes to railways this is the tashkent metro built by the soviets in 1977 it was Central Asia's first urban rail line [Music] it still is one of the most stunning metros anywhere [Music] there are 29 stations each with its own unique architectural theme for a long time there was a photography ban on the secret railway stations that's because they served another role as nuclear fallout shelters whose Becca stands metro stations were important military installations it was only in 2018 that the photography band got lifted allowing journalists like us to bring you these gorgeous images there's one dedicated to cotton the country's main export one to use Beck rulers of old and this one is dedicated to more otherworldly aspirations it's the cosmonaut station [Music] celebrating space travel the stars and everything celestial with an array of murals and glass and light shows that confound the mind [Music] [Music] here is a painting of Gagarin the first man in space and he was Russian this whole station feels very cool and dark and evokes this feeling like you're in outer space the Russians did a decent job getting the city of Tashkent connected but it is the Chinese who helped connect with Beca Stan to the world news Beca Stan is one of two only double landlocked countries in the world do you know the second one say Kazakhstan no that's Liechtenstein Europe okay and double and low country means that we have to pass the borders of at least two countries to reach the sea so all our neighbors are also landlocked countries and we are double and locked country so for us the logistics transport corridors these are very important that belton wrote initiative it basically focuses on reintroduction of all these you know connectivity between Europe Asia so that the goods can you know be easily transported from the Yellow Sea for example to the Europe and who's Becky stan is just in the center of this route in September 2016 China inaugurated a railway line that runs through is becca stan to afghanistan and pakistan now it wants to build another line connecting who's becca Stan to Kyrgyzstan and onwards to China the railway linking Kabul which is capital of Afghanistan and Peshawar which is in Pakistan and this will allow us to link the whole railway system of Central Asia CIS Europe with the South Asian railing railways Pakistan India and this will of course open enormous opportunities you know unprecedented opportunities for boosting trade between different regions of the world especially in the Eurasian continent this is what built an Road initiative is about then Uzbekistan will be fully plugged in ah of course I mean after that we will not be concerned so much about our double landlocked status and we will become like Liechtenstein these railway links will have a huge impact on industry and one industry is perfectly poised to prosper [Music] cotton from which these clothes are made is Uzbekistan's third-largest export earner after natural gas and food agriculture the country is one of the world's largest cotton producers cotton is so important here that it's called white gold on any given month 3,000 tons of cotton gets exported from Tashkent ASEAN in China along the Silk Road that's enough to make 10 million t-shirts [Music] to see how all this fashion is made I've come to one of the country's largest textile companies check out all this cotton hi Omar hello I drink good good good to meet you so this is the factory huh yes and this is step one in the long journey from bloom to fabric whole purpose of the department is to clean the quarter so this machine is defined cleaning machine so it'd be like moving particles like maybe dead insects and dust yeah it it takes some black particles blue rats the computer scans the cotton for these particles and they get mechanically extracted the next step is to comb the cotton Automation supercharges this otherwise tedious process finally clean this like as how you comb your hair okay so the fiber basically are formed in this machine and then finally you see a product this right here yeah because here we don't have the twist in the fibers for the next process is where we make we go towards the spinning process we have they twist six slivers are twisted into one thread from start to finish it takes five days and involves many machines and hands and that's just to make thread how much cotton does it take to make let's say like your t-shirt no this okay now how has the belt road initiative how has that impacted your business the fashion industry is growing fast and in fact every industry is doing doing fast so everybody needs the the products in time so definitely better for the initiative it gives up great infrastructure for the producers to supplier to their guests Just In Time strategy so shortly it will reduce your capital investment over your stocks so you can make planning with lower stocks in your warehouse and get the products fresh products just in time if you are in the geographical position where your delivery times are more definitely you will attract less customers due to your delivery time even if you are producing very high quality the output in this goes back factory feeds China's insatiable demand for cotton China remains the world's biggest clothing exporter despite rising labor costs it's the New Silk Road that's helping China stay on top of the textile trade major brands require fashion to be fast which means that runway trends should be available in shops in less than a month as of 2017 about 90% of all fast fashion worldwide is transported by either see or rail and it's the belt and Road in its opening up of new global links and appendages that's helping suppliers cope with growing global demand it's making it faster for cotton in Uzbekistan to wind up in China's textile factories to be transformed into a piece of clothing and reach the stores you shop in nowadays even if you talk about the fashion industry it's going very fast so everybody needs to have new things very fast and to react overall to display change the infrastructure is very important the New Silk Road will set up sweeping changes not just in the fashion business but across industries some trades are up for the chop [Music] [Music] this is tour su bazaar Tashkent best-known market the dome is one of the city's most iconic landmarks an impressive setting for an equally impressive showcase of people and produce on the move look at all these carrots they even chopped it up for you - now that's convenient [Music] see this looks like cheese right it's actually blocks of cow fat the food here is intriguing but it's in the fruit trade where the sweetest deals are being made many Chinese companies have stopped importing American fruits because of the us-china trade war many have turned to Central Asia to get insight I'm meeting with the man responsible for whose Becca Stan's food exports you are see here we export to all over the world ok for example this premium class present we export to China please try out sure oh yeah oh very nice do you like it it on yes but we have other fruits as well now we'll go to fresh fruit stuff currently we are exporting fresh cherries to China ah ok and what other fruits and vegetables are you hoping to export as well was based on planning to have the permission of export to China for fresh produce like apricots fresh melons hmm and then I hope that by step we increase our fresh produce exports to China such as plums peaches whatever other fresh fruits that China Marx will like I hope we'll export that is Russia your biggest customer yes Russia's current our biggest customer but very soon we'll access to China market China is ten times more bigger than Russia market is then the volume will be bigger than what currently we are exporting to Russia I see so you're hoping to make China your biggest market then yes of the many facets discussed about the belt and Road initiative the focus on agriculture is often overlooked yet food security ranks high on any country's agenda and China is no exception China is currently grappling with a daunting conundrum how to feed nearly one-fifth of the world's population with less than 1/10 of its farmland for example the Chinese eat nearly three times as much meat as in 1990 to keep up with demand they have had to diversify food imports according to a Chinese national action plan under the belt and Road initiative provinces in western China will work with Central Asia and fruit grain and animal husbandry pros Becca Stan which depends on agriculture for about a quarter of all jobs the Chinese plan spells opportunity what is this this is Uzbekistani 1,000 years old oh wow it's made of rice and tasty meat and carrots raisins you know this dish looks a lot like biryani yeah so I'm sure this recipe must have travelled along the ancient Silk Road yes it is a travel from who the central truth Becky Stan and you can find the plots with a different recipe in every province of Uzbekistan and also in different parts of the world for example in Turkey pilaf they have in Afghanistan well it looks very tasty and I'm starving so let's go try it out yes so back to our earlier topic yes how has China's belton Road initiative impacted the agriculture sector it is boosting our agriculture sector because the market is getting water and water and we're importing from China new agricultural machinery the new innovations new seeds in new technologies coming from China from by using this one belt and one road strategy now our Chinese companies come here to is becca stan and investing in the agriculture business yes they are investing a lot they are investing in different parts of agricultural sector from seeding up to processing storage in logistic according to Xinhua news China's total food imports amounted to 58 point two eight billion US dollars in 2017 the figure rises 25 percent year-on-year experts believe that if current growth rates continue China will become the world's largest food importer Chinese companies have already been buying up land and water resources along with dairies and food processing factories across the world China's big agriculture companies are jumping on the belt and Road bandwagon they speak enthusiastically of a Silk Road of cereals and a Silk Road dairy Alliance [Music] delete rashes from super sure numbers idea that up for me - gua ions how may know more suited up and returning a solution check out your children world Christians in the US and a father should shut up

they've also built 16 factories that are churning out shoes leather products water taps and ceramic tiles and we eat hot food anyways young ongoingly and pony do sometimes don't get that John you go

employees are working here you go you're eating something funny I'm going for my portfolio the average income in many factories in this country is about 150 US dollars and money twenty-five-year-old kamal can yar makes about double that amount after five years of work experience here at ping Chang me listen to your spoil em yeah um doc oh come on I'm guessing game team all of you two are the

languages huh shut up how am i you're so drunk a younger woman oh you mean it's actually you prefer hi - hi how are you na ho Romania kasha you uncle Jaime frustrated humming hey also don't meow for some jolly old the school was originally set up for the workers from China who relocated their families to his Becca Stan and had no local childcare option today this kindergarten is also popular amongst the locals it is initiatives like this that win hearts and minds on China's Silk Road to thank the kids for their time I brought a special treat this is compliments of [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is the Tashkent campus of the management Development Institute of Singapore the school was set up in 2007 today it caters to about 2,900 students so why did you choose to study here at this school personally I choose this University because of the variety of programs they offer this is the only place in was back east on to study risk and management that's why I came here what do you think that was Pakistani economy is going I would say we entered a new phase in our development because for last like 20 25 years we've been looking for stability now we enter the phase when we want to see changes there are plenty of changes reforms in taxation system in financial systems now we trying to make our country even better to rice what are your thoughts on the belt and road initiative now I have some of my friends who who's studying Chinese now and looking for partners in China already because when the initiative will start bringing this a new organization it will be very competitive and if you have now some one partner in China that will be great for example in other local universities people are or has already started learning Chinese Mandarin some of our students are right now started like working logistics and right now our university actually provide MBA program for supply chain management so I think it's a good initiative for us the belton Road initiative was launched in 2013 initially it was Confucius Institutes funded by China that offered training opportunities related to the Bri now many independent and state-funded schools all over Central Asia are also tweaking their curriculum to support the needs of the Bri singaporean Andrew Chiu who heads the school has lived here the last three years so what do you think are the prospects of the uzbek economy who's Becky Stein is a developing country it's an economy that has a lot of potential for example in terms of tourism that's an area with a huge potential to be tapped on but before they can do that for example they need to really improve the infrastructure they have to improve the processes they have to do this very quickly very systematically very methodically and over a very short timeframe one of the top tourism sites in Uzbekistan is Samar Khan and I've heard there is a huge belt and road initiative by China to help the Uzbek strap up their tourism infrastructure here but before I discover the details of this plan I need to understand the city's history some Archon was a vital stop on the ancient Silk Road where Chinese traders met their Persian Arab and European counterparts but it wasn't always fair trade legend has it that in the year 751 the secret of papermaking was obtained from two Chinese prisoners here this led to the first paper meal being set up outside of China the invention then spread to the rest of the Islamic world and from there to Europe being a rich trading city it was also fought over by many powers it was conquered by genghis khan in 1220 and also at one time a Tang Dynasty Protectorate but it was team or one of Central Asia's most famous historic figures who gave some mark on these magnificent buildings [Music] Timur claimed an empire of his own in the 14th century a territory that stretched from South Asia to the Middle East extending all the way from Delhi to Aleppo he slaughtered millions and sent the skilled artisans and craftsmen back to his capital here at some mark on [Music] today thousands still come to his tomb every year to pay their respects including that was Beck's Special Forces it is believed that team was a great conquer died while on his way to wage war against the ming emperor in the year 1405 timor had gathered an army of 200,000 men to invade China the Timur was 69 years old already at the time and he never made it to the borders of China nowadays it is the Chinese who come to see him and it's not just the tourists a few blocks away from Tim Moore's tomb Chinese architects are hard at work under the Bri Chinese urban planners are working to redesign Samar Khan and it will be paid for by the Chinese silk road fund choice of the tall bounnam poor where you should see this some typical Hana villages are in Selenia somehow shakily untie my beanie and there you go hung the Macario shitty my each so in the trenches evil that from Moodle you got maybe 30 ownership so in that easy short wheeler aren't in studying in change to the Father but it'll change the portrait the entrepot we fart Anjali and the molten someone hoodie that we teach you to do she did have a good shelter under the plan which was made in consultation with the Uzbek government the population of Samar Khan will be doubled to 1 million we had a summer intuition that woman she want an engine we was the peak of the time what yeah dear about whom should realize what I enter the parents of the children Django the mucho are you okay coach told her she can listen to any cost function pins in the Tamiya a union jumbo Khwaja the teens estancia Raja on the villa how we watch coach hire you and Chu I hope you me a gt2 marginal China and you me at City I call dances are here get her Josh over 2500 years ago some mark on was built on the riches of the old Silk Road now perhaps a renaissance is coming for Central Asia connected to China's New Silk Road by a network of roads rails power grids oil pipelines and an array of projects this vast land of opportunity looks poised to reclaim its place at the center of global trade [Music]

because those who arrive late to the Chinese markets probably won't be able to sell all their goods and they'll be making that return trip back with full baskets and empty wallets and that is a walk of shame no one wants to make forty-five-year-old vegetable sellers shem takes part in this mad rush every morning while the border gate opens at 7:00 a.m. every day his day begins three hours earlier that's a lock i wholesale market [Music] here he and his wife spend more than an hour picking the freshest produce which they will later carry across the hakko but I wonder if the payoff from his tedious daily routine is really worth it [Music] as your standard of living improved since doing trade with China I'm about to partake of some they know they know Kali Cheon makes double selling vegetables in China compared to what he would make selling them locally he bought a motorcycle just for the job but before he can sell anything he along with hundreds of others have to first cross the border the immigration clearance is a fuss free affair made all the more pleasant by a very welcoming vibe don't know it either the easy crossing is telling of how close these two countries have become [Music] imports and exports via Luke I totaled 1.6 billion u.s. dollars just in the first half of 2018 and during those same six months the export of agricultural and seafood products from Lao Cai to China raked in more than 300 million dollars in revenue for the city but while the people of Lao Cai have certainly profited from cushy relations with China in the present you do wonder if their past ever gets in the way of their furthering this newfound friendship [Music] I'm in the mountains overlooking Lao Cai province in 1979 this valley was a battleground the site of one of the fiercest fights between Vietnamese and Chinese soldiers in the month-long sino-vietnamese war the border war was triggered by Viet Nam's invasion of Cambodia which was then under the rule of the china-backed Khmer Rouge in 17 days of bloody fighting thousands of Vietnamese died [Music] now nearly 40 years on I'm wondering if the folks from this very community caught in the epicenter of that conflict have managed to move on 31 year old time runs the most popular restaurant in Lao Cai he was born eight years after the conflict but vaguely recalled stories his parents told him about that dark episode in Viet Nam's history the momentum okay well cooked in Rakuten China been doing the super phenom the min senior dollar we took worked and sang banana like my home why that today Ty and his family have not only moved on from the war they welcomed the Chinese we spend as much as a hundred and twenty thousand US dollars every month at his restaurant nearly half of their customers are Chinese nationals who regularly cross the border for the fresh seafood Lao Cai stands for the 14th annual having taught me to talk or do katsumi lemon the partying focus on hood hood you interact with Chinese visitors at your restaurant quite a lot what impression do you have of the Chinese until come in the I don't like to cook you don't leave yet so thank you thanks Andy can we sit missile imaginary with equality I don't know do they do but outside Lao Cai the mood maybe a little less conciliatory what happened in 1979 remains fresh in the minds of Vietnamese across the country some groups have even resorted to use in 1979 as a linchpin to stir up tension surrounding the two countries territorial disputes in the South China Sea most recently in June 2018 plans to build three new special economic zones and a bill proposing new lease terms for foreign firms sparked fresh protests under new laws foreign investors can now lease land in industrial parks like these for up to 99 years so longer than the terms before which was 70 years and that is wearing many Vietnamese who fear the government's relations with China are a little too cozy and worse that they might have already given the mighty Chinese a little too much game in their own economy economist dr. Burt Rutan feels that the worries and fears on the ground are still a little too premature because the draft laws would have to go too many rounds of debates and deliberations before anyone decides to pass them you need to go through very rigorous procedure and at the initial decision by the prime minister many guy of dimension eating about right liberalization fry in terms of incentive for the business for the investment so right now a lot of the bed in Vietnam right number whether we need to that guy or economics patient's own right because we are already very open whatever the outcome of the bill it's unlikely that Chinese investors will be perturbed by the recent developments for many Chinese companies Vietnam offers cheaper labor and a relatively young population with workers below the age of 35 dominating the assembly lines all this coupled with access to the broader ASEAN market is what attracted Vina Soler a leading producer in solar panels to set up its manufacturing operations here by utilizing cutting-edge robotic technology to produce high quality solar panels veena is seeking to promote the use of Chinese solar technology among the Vietnamese community the majority of people in Vietnam and across Southeast Asia can't really afford to install solar panels in their homes so who are your main customers then poor men no go and then go Tico couldn't pay heed couldn't how that happened tamping down hominin go to see cherry and joy Holden thought I should wait to Soylent Donna she want then go horrid I said are you an an amputee Kwanzaa how that Ichi Jing Zhu shin woman you work that's happening right fun ham and cheese yet yeah we gonna want you to chat him the soul who the totally without up Ivan - there's been a rise in anti-chinese sentiment in Vietnam recently and in the past protesters have attacked factories and companies how concerned are you about this Shinta tested arrested had a warrant a Livonia tomji she don't bear in the past your ankle so fact it is Yoshi insulin new iPad no are still young gone so time to don't Isola Lucas orange a moment she she she come quick cheerleader she you know one she that just in a father John Tom the Coons are so low potential call leo sunbae actually atomic enjoy that song go see a girl Saturn Sheen to it hammer home the bounds would have a coupon she got some attention from creating jobs to cross-border trade the benefits of collaborating with the Chinese are being appreciated by locals across the country but a vast majority of the population have mixed feelings about China's new Silk Road plan and are instead pushing for stronger ties with Viet Nam's former enemy [Music] [Music] I'm in Vietnam one of osteons most dynamic economies in one of two communist countries in the Southeast Asian region and Viet Nam's embrace of its communist identity is hard to miss [Music] socialist posters like this one can be found in public spaces across the country the national flag bears a variation of the iconic star a universally recognized symbol of communism there's even a park dedicated to Vladimir Lenin in the heart of Hanoi [Music] you'd expect China and Vietnam shared communist ideologies to smooth out the rough patches they've had in the past like the 1979 border war and the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea or maybe not because both countries might still be reconciling their checkered history and that's despite being comrades in arms during Vietnam most famous war ironically many Vietnamese still appear to be more forgiving towards the Americans whom they spent 20 years fighting than the Chinese who invaded the country in 1979 in fact a recent survey found that 84% of Vietnamese viewed the United States favorably compared to 10% who Express positive attitudes towards China but the reality is in recent years it has been the Chinese not the Americans that have been helping Vietnam develop some of its most critical infrastructure the Vietnamese government continues to be caught in a tough balancing act while it recognizes the people's attitudes towards China it also needs to raise more than a hundred billion dollars worth of investment to meet the country's infrastructure needs and China's extensive Belton Road initiative offers many opportunities for Vietnam to fill this wide infrastructure gap a case in point is the Catlin haedong urban railway line in Hanoi for which China provided more than 300 million dollars in loans it also supplied the manpower and technology that was used in the railways construction one man can have positive contribution to infrastructure development in the sofa you can observe the tariff reduction very significantly even we have in the reason many API free trade areas so parry is no more problem so how you can facilitate you try investment and business so connectivity infrastructure development a important in principle Vietnam has already committed to participating in China's belt and road initiative Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam in November 2017 saw the signing of an MoU in which both China and Vietnam pledged to implement the belt and road initiative but the question on many observers minds is whether the recent MOU would lead to any further substantial collaborations so far not any project come from that initiative of you're not like many other countries they already have some displacement from the IRB I think not because of two reasons number one Vietnam in the process of development and we change yeah man the infrastructure development especially since the launch of the one belt one Road plan China has repeatedly emphasized that the initiative is not just about investing in infrastructure it also hopes to use the New Silk Road to promote cultural exchanges between the Chinese and communities around the world in line with this goal Beijing co-sponsored the construction of this state-of-the-art building the China Vietnam Friendship palace was officially opened by Chinese President Xi Jinping himself in November 2017 this massive mural is what greets you when you enter the palace and it depicts a very vibrant cultural exchange between the two countries China and Vietnam and it showcases the various ethnic groups cultural performances and it really encapsulates what both governments seek to achieve with this venue the 35 million dollar building is decked out with the most modern equipment and facilities it has everything you'd need to hold meetings dialogues and parties between the two sides but since it opened about a year ago there hasn't been any of that happening just yet [Music] donjuan for me is the vice-president of the vietnam union of friendship organizations the institution which runs the place at the moment the palace is not under full operation as some of the technical check ups adjustments have to be made but activities like cultural events performances exhibitions language classes traditional medicine receiving visitors from vietnam and china those kind of activities will happen at a time when there might be certain strong feelings towards china in the region how important is it for organizations like you to kind of create a bridge between let's say vietnam and china the attitude of the vietnam is to work together to address issues and with disputes over the islands that belong to vietnam we are determined to continue working with other countries especially china to address according to international laws and by peaceful means diplomatic channels within peace is key to development and prosperity while we wait for the China Vietnam Friendship palace to officially open locals elsewhere in Hanoi have already taken it upon themselves to promote Chinese cultural activities in their community take hai for example he's a former national athlete who was sent by the Vietnamese government to China to learn wushu when he returned he set up this Taiji Club in Hanoi now he's imparting those same values and philosophies he learnt about the art form to his students [Music] mostly John McCain and dangler cheaply MZ Wang no arching Lakai the lot up to the mountain Chile sang-joong rate up in a hillbilly type unison hi horsey Penn bamboo Banton weapon bang do you think that cultural activities like Tai Chi may be a solution towards building bridges between the two countries the military economic Japan you a teen on a Zubat thought knapsack on open hey Luca con un Ojo versa capita they know that no microrna time I open a totally got him to salute [Music] the key to mastering Tai Chi is finding your balance thank you and that's something Viet Nam's government is struggling to do as it seeks new opportunities for collaborating with China while at the same time being careful that it doesn't alienate itself from its public emits a growing protest culture but stories like that of highs do offer some hope it's an example of meaningful people-to-people exchanges which is a key pillar of the belt and road initiative [Music] progress on that front is already in high gear across the border in Laos where Chinese and lotions now collaborate in many industries from construction to film production the Chinese might be winning Lao hearts and minds in the process but can their money help Laos where it matters most to fulfill the landlord's emissions to the osteons next investment hotspot [Music] I'm on the final leg of my journey along China's new Silk Road in Indochina and today my travels have brought me to be in 10 the capital of Laos but before I begin my journey exploring China's growing footprint in the country I'm going to take a slight detour to check out a prominent vientiane icon [Music] it's the first stop for any tourists coming into the city and the most important national monument in town the battousai Laos Arc de triumph as tour guides call it seems to be iconic and ironic fashioned after the one in Paris the Batu Sai is a tribute to Lao soldiers who bravely fought and died during the country struggle for independence against the French French and Indo Chinese influences inspire its design and the cement that was used to build it all was donated by the United States the Americans thought it would be used to build an airport thousands would have an arc instead the city's older residents call this a vertical runway just nearby another monument has a less complicated context I'm not only interested in boxin side but also what's next to it here's a water fountain donated by the Chinese government a symbol of Chinese friendship right in the heart of Laos in history a sign of the deep ties that the two countries share [Music] nearly 15 years since the fountains installation the relationship between Beijing and its southern neighbor is stronger than ever because of what's happening elsewhere in the country there's a constant flow of Chinese money into Laos and that's slowly turning this developing country into an investment hub China has invested in everything from hospitals satellite internet and television to shopping malls [Music] [Applause] and when it comes to malls the m10 Center bill two years ago is currently the newest and biggest in the country it's five hectares of anything of Vientiane city-slicker might ever need including a Singaporean style food court dominated by Chinese food stalls this mall is actually pretty small compared to malls in other capital cities across ASEAN like Bangkok for example however I must say that this mall looks pretty sleek and modern and as the first fully air-conditioned retail and entertainment hub in the city it fills a critical void in Laos society especially for its youth that's if they can afford any of this the average lowchen earns just a little more than 200 US dollars a month what this new mall is really selling is a new middle-class lifestyle that's very aspirational and very exciting and I wonder if those aspirations are within the reach of most locals I'm meeting Miao jeongwu he's the general manager of North namche undeveloped Minh the malls parent company as the manager of this mall what is your observation bin do you find that the typical allowing customer or guests to the mall are they able to afford the majority of products that you have for sale here yes I think the majority of our products they affordable for them like for instance just for one noodle one lunch you can go like 20,000 deep in us is around two and a half dollars so affordable and the fold the clothes the price is around a hundred thousand deep so in dollar it's gonna be like 15 okay 15 to 20 dollars so it's not expensive in your opinion would you describe the majority of your customers is mainly being maybe middle class I think yes middle class because before the more opening for the people who won't get middle class products there's no place for them to shop in that so they're gone across the border to Thailand [Music] shopping wasn't the only attraction that drove oceans to time malls there was also this other fix lotions do love their movies and with the opening of this cinema on the top floor of the intense center many have been spared the hassle of crossing the border to catch the latest Hollywood flicks this five Hall Cineplex boasts the most modern theatre facilities in the country and it's on par with any modern cinema in the region this is easily the most popular place within the mall especially among the youth tonight a woman oh so you like a girl I'm told that in addition to local and Hollywood films the cinema also screens Chinese movies which have become very popular among the lotions but lotions are not just watching on the big screen they're also watching in the comfort of their homes and it's not just movies but Chinese TV dramas as well which are a big hit in Laos there's such a staple among WoW households that an entire industry has emerged dedicated to converting them for audiences here Salian has one of the most famous voices in Laos he's been the go-to dubbing artist for English movies for more than 40 years now but these days Sally young and his audio engineer are getting much more work coming from Chinese content there's much more demand for them thanks to TV platforms like lhasa a chinese run satellite TV service based in vientiane why do you think there's been such a strong demand for Chinese films and TV dramas among Wow audience kyoko company oh wow did you know simcha been been home now atiba you know Meera no TV no mati mati don't I know in whom relative a saw song saying can kill top hit company what that Hong Kong saw did not like a who loves and and a whole lotta me welcome now to me with a civet animal Civic and tongue okay how come you do allow how no it's and I didn't get I allowed the young boy come out you know in other countries you might have audiences who are learning Korean to follow the Korean dramas or they will watch the series in the original language let's say like Chinese and then have the subtitles in their own language why do you think that lotions want to watch Chinese film TV dramas dubbed in in mouth I'm hobby Joe could not I know Kalani Haji well if it's updated miss allowing coloboma I know it's a lie college market boom boom look at my phone no yeah but you manicotti wha lamella yeah no no me and as a team like a number now pontine from malls movies to manufacture [Music] China has pumped billions of dollars into Laos over the past five years making it the largest foreign investor into the country and much of this investment is concentrated in a multi-billion dollar mega railway that will link Laos major cities to China's Yunnan Province but will this mammoth project plunge the country into a debt trap [Music] [Music] as a landlocked largely mountainous country with many in the population living in poverty Laos has for years been perched high on the United Nations list of least developed countries in an attempt to graduate from this list the Lao government has sought billions of dollars in aid and infrastructure investment from China this has helped Laos develop critical infrastructure and places it on track to become osteons next investment hotspot [Music] I visit a Belton Road project that seeks to bring Laos closer to realizing this goal through the Belton Road initiative China has poured record amounts of capital into their less wealthy southern neighbor one of their more prominent projects is this one thus I set a development zone which was jointly set up by the vientiane municipal government and the Yunnan construction and investment Holding Group it's mostly a vast vacant plot now with just over 40 factories but once construction is complete this thousand hectare plot will be more than your usual industrial park there are already plans to build schools hospitals apartments shopping centers and even tourist attractions Leo who is chairman of the Laos China joint investment company the consortium responsible for developing this zone he saw the strategic value in setting up a special development zone in Laos early on we hiko can tune up and out so you could other chairs on the kocha no matter how cool yet to show Tom Verducci talking with part open Okocha Tony Angela sister party you go chiisana use tear got had serious and I use now

long time in your country watching who sang she'd one chance in tune - ojala part where you go Jenga come on when the movie I don't wanna aside without souvenir soon we the whole I thought how you could see and buy some time do you sir the engine once young cinta [Music] it would take another five years for this I set a development zone to take shape and while both the Lao and Chinese government's hope to draw on the success of this zone to elevate Laos profile as an investment hub they are faced with one critical challenge Laos own geography with its majestic mountains and green valleys through which flows the mighty Mekong River Laos offers some of the most breathtaking views in Southeast Asia but these natural wonders are also its greatest curse the terrain makes travel across the country difficult and that has long deterred investors I visit the site of a six billion dollar Chinese project which promises to help Laos solve this perennial problem [Music] the key to the success of the susceptor development zone is transforming laos from a landlocked to a land linked country and here's how China is helping Laos achieve this as you can see construction is already underway in Luang Prabang for a 414 kilometer railway line linking China to mainland Southeast Asia when completed the railway has the potential to help Laos boost transhipment income by plugging the country into the broader belton road network [Music] this is just one of dozens of tunnels that are being built to allow trains to cut through Laos numerous mountains and they won't just be passing through mountains but across rivers as well here in Luang Prabang a massive bridge is being constructed over the Mekong River which will eventually be linked to the tunnels while I can certainly see how Laos stands to benefit from all this connectivity I can't help but wonder about the impact of all this construction on this heritage town [Music] Oh Melissa by t-ball somebody sabaidee my upon is a staunch supporter of the project because of the hundreds of jobs it is created for the local community including himself he works for the Chinese railway construction company as the captain of this barge the barge transports trucks and construction supplies across the river every 30 minutes along with creating jobs chitta pond service also benefits his fellow villagers who travel on the barge for free passes on go OD Tolyatti oh come on ya go buddy seeing and they come hanoi to confirm with guy oh I think I know I've been here soon - how was your life changed since taking on the job of piloting these barges they were how they my youtube mean he'll I saw we remember YouTube me if you have a couple can be some love - how soon before volume when DJ's a Michael Kay mcclenney Banta cho youngnam because once it works about a pieman hat and nap you know you one guy and kyun my mom and dad said well sir by me not fight no banquet here kabocha me while the mega railway is being celebrated by many in the local community it has also attracted skepticism the project is funded almost entirely by loans from China and with the country's total public debt currently at 70% of these GDP Laos is in critical danger of being set up for a debt trap with China battening Singhania who works in the Laos Chamber of Commerce feels that the costs are justified in the name of progress you know you look into the long terms you know development so we have moved from this landlocked okay to learn linked initiatives and I think that in as a way although is a big investments but I think is a way that can help I don't think that it's just the only way but it can be one of the options that can help so I think connectivity is very important and that's the reason maybe the government has decided to go although it's very big project and it'll cost a lot of a public debt in neighbouring vang vien faith in the mega railway project is equally strong there's a train stop plan for this riverside town and that's raised optimism among the businesses here ever since construction began many foreign investors have also set up shops and restaurants in anticipation of receiving more visitors and more business once the railway starts running Tong Fung a Chinese entrepreneur was quick to jump on the bandwagon he runs a tour agency specializing in outdoor activities such as kayaking and buggy rides already his business attracts close to 4,000 tourists a month he believes this is nothing compared to the number of visitors who will flock here once the belt and road infrastructure projects are completed talita yellow Sorong Sanford suit indigo some tada Shambo Moody Sudha Willa Tweety don't knock watch our country father who taught home PA woman continues honking yoo-hoo

worry you koala ah da da da da da da la la la as the saying goes When in Rome do as the Romans do so I conclude my six country journey by exploring bound them the same way tongues customers do all right down the rocket roll [Music] [Music] this journey has certainly given me a lot to reflect on I've seen firsthand how Chinese investment has improved the standards of living for many communities throughout the region but I've also seen cases of how these success stories have come at a price for the locals there are still challenges that states within ASEAN need to address eventually with China despite how much Chinese investment is being celebrated the new Silk Road offers many opportunities to collaborate and I would like to see the spirit of cooperation continue to inspire solutions for overcoming the existing challenges it's only then that China's growing footprint into ASEAN will not be met with fear but a sense of hope [Music]

I look for each and every corners each details is perfectly clear and then I look for the setup [Music] when you enter the room and when you look around that you can see everything is matching then all the things are set up perfectly I'm just doing some adjustment it's just the light is perfect that will not disturb my eyes when I return and not too far as what I understand until all those years there is no perfect room but whatever you are doing to make it close to perfect actually [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] in a matter of weeks the second phase of Raffles reconstruction will begin then the hotel will need a new space in which to welcome its residents [Music] just a few paces away from the current Lobby are the East India rooms its burns job to transform a slightly drab function room into a temporary lobby you'd be fitting a five-star hotel it's gonna be our new Lobby over here we are gonna have couches and armchairs have our desks set up here a concierge desk a front desk or reception desk two of them actually also the whole purpose is to take this dysfunction room that it used to be before and decorated in the way that it does not even give that feeling of a temporary Lobby but it could actually be a real Lobby can I come in it's the door is the door gonna have a closing mechanism confident while Bernd oversees the transformation of the hotel's newest public space in the Tiffin room and raffles continues serenely hosting tea to a full house [Music] sharp [Music] it's 6:30 a.m. at raffles Hotel the madam chef is beginning her day with a brisk four kilometer walk why I'm looking for for this walk is to see the sunrise although duty manager Rose Lee has the day off he has decided to join madam shoe [Music] you know what they is not moving so it's that big mirror we are Wow while Bruce Lee is distracted by the view madam chief marches on for once service at raffles is struggling to keep up it's the end of July 2017 and in two weeks time seventy percent of Raffles foreclosed for its historic restoration this evening the hotel will hold a final grand event a charity gala to celebrate its one hundred and thirtieth birthday a table that tonight's party will cost tens of thousands of dollars [Music] with that price tag the experience must be flawless [Music] everybody's mathematics so I need to make sure everything is open up [Music] okay be careful ax slowly it's funny [Music] there will be a silent auction during the five course dinner this evening and raffles hotel has donated some of its treasured prints pictures and furnishings to the auctions there are a total of 15 individual items for auction so on these items that are for option we actually have a long history with a very colorful background like the testator dining table at the end of raffles crew that was actually used by Queen Elizabeth during her royal visit to Singapore if I could I would actually like to have her set off the mirror it has read like a by the size and it's very intricately designed over in the East India rooms bound is also curating raffles art collection right here so this goes there very good comments of knowing so how's the director of rooms and the hotel's interim general manager hair vulturing are here to check on Byrnes progress make sure that that door is always closed and ice engineering to have a look at the the roof to sort of level it out it's messy here the temporary lobby will be the new face raffles into the hotel finally closes in December so naturally the GM wants it to be perfect and attention to detail is key it's gonna be a long search finding the same size map as well as finding two equally sized maps burned needs to coordinate with housekeeping to get the furniture into the new Lobby three just - no no no don't don't cut it let's cut the crap because no no need 33 Suites if you ever get shaken in and one checking in [Music] while burned goes in search of furniture rods Li has a mission of his own to finally solve the mystery of the great a cupcake I'm Jesse Aviv the box of peanuts how do you find it it's nice usually been in a gun inside very interesting you like to try the old one in for the origins of the way they have this crest Andy Serkis brother we just roll away in 1919 mrs. brown's grandfather after a fair amount of gin at a stag party liberated a silver from this very bar in a little less than an hour the first garlic guests will arrive the tables are set glass is polished and the old Lobby is almost ready for one last glitzy celebration in qualifier loose nail we need to make sure more time this matter on the table if we don't have enough point in the clashes is very important the guess gonna have additional demands for meeting as Sun sets some of Singapore's most glamorous citizens are arriving behind the scenes focus is shifted to final preparation of the first course okay under the razor sharp gaze of executive chef Pierre the five-course menu have been planned for months and chef Pierre inspects every plate for the smallest of imperfections [Music] why you better move Thank You Sanford we do a superb Milwaukee for chef the first course the first impression is the most important tonight we celebrate heritage we celebrate legacy but most ladies and gentlemen we celebrate community the kitchen staff tasked with plating the appetizers are hard at work perfection takes time but time is running out the waitstaff have just ten minutes to serve the first course to 140 guests [Music] but the discreet not each plate is placed in front of each guest at exactly the same time where the first table served the staff need to keep up the pace there should be little or no delay between service to every guest luckily the next plates are not far behind [Music] the main course beef wellington with black truffle and red wine reduction is being plated it's a dish that needs to be served immediately another challenge for the way to start [Music] chef's tricky beef wellington arrives on time piping hot and picture-perfect [Music] and once dessert and coffee you've been served and the evening silent auction has started all the items put up for auction found new owners save one the Queen Elizabeth table it will remain awaiting her Majesty's next visit the evening raised over 400,000 Singapore dollars for charity a fitting finale to this chapter of the rapid story Luciano once again thank you so much [Music] moving day big day in a little over 10 hours the Raffles lobby and 70 of is 103 Suites was shut down for the first time in close to 30 years [Music] we remove the red carpet today we make everything look out there like this is not a hotel anymore Bernd is stealthily moving furniture from one of the grand suites I'm sorry the heavy one into the temporary lobby I said guests ain't no guest sees us moving those things around still a normal hotel [Music] with just a few hours to go the staff hustles to add finishing touches converting this space into the lobby of a five-star hotel meanwhile the old lobby well today see its final guests depart [Music] so this is are they taking yes yes you are the last guests in to15 yes you are a part of the hastily now are we going to see you back next year right away with the hotel opens to some the long-term residents are more than just guests there are going to be a lot of these bittersweet goodbyes today she is the most kind person I've ever met in the world so how long has she been coming here almost 2000 years and she always says in the same room Jim [Music] a raffles doorman for 26 years for Norwich on this day is going to be particularly hard [Music] [Music] and that's my last cup of China Lobby facade red you are our last check out today it has to change I accept it has to change to keep up with the times I'll see we've just become out of day it but I hope that the character is going to be maintained it's not the state to turn into like thousands of other modern hotels around the world I like [Music] but the final pieces of furniture in place and a quick polish the East India rooms are ready for their new role the result I think is just better than what I expected in the main lobby raffles history is being recorded as always and it's last poignant moments are reserved for the staff and so as the main building closes it is also a wonderful opportunity to enjoy a last look at our beloved icon and take a trip down memory lane with all the residents have checked out the staff have said their final goodbyes the lobby is still [Music] [Applause] the very next day a schism dramatic change the housekeeping staff are tasked with cataloguing and emptying the main building there is a lot of things that is going into different places pink elastica this is to be retained that means the hotel is keeping these items [Applause] before the restoration can check in the hotel must check out every single removable item comfy chairs king-size beds ornate mirrors and of course chandelier thousands of individual items that will not be returning we only have two weeks to hang over this block and the main building time is very tight because items are heavy and they are delicate care for the ceiling down as the lobby fills up Kaylee keeps careful track of the total value of these antiques we are talking about eight hundred and eighty-six thousand it's those days I already got the bedroom now we take this Kappa that cost hundred twenty thousand will go into okay but something's not quite right this one is fine Persian carpets like paintings are all individually signed by the weaver the signature on the lobby carpet doesn't match what's on the inventory a carpet valued at a hundred and twenty thousand Singapore dollars seems to have gone missing finding a particular Persian carpet at raffles is like looking for a needle in a haystack [Music] we can't afford to lose that six-digit couple [Music] [Music] the needle has been found and a relieved Kaylee can breathe again tonight there is someone very special checking out it's very cool day I should dress up nicely for 57 visits raffles has been more than a hotel for Madam's shoes this one you want me to carry it down oh you can if you want you can carry it down okay I shut the door man okay the staff have become like family and raffles a home away from home your time is over okay see you again next year okay and Wow very nice and smile one more time thank you the step to leave now is a bit hard because I don't know I will see when I'm coming back for us Lee these are precious moments he'll accompany madam Xu all the way to the airport madam chief is not just a longtime resident but a dear friend she's almost like mother figure I miss my mother so much she left us last December like never seen see you back in February yeah she she also visited mummies mummies grave with me before [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for two months the restoration of Raffles has been gathering speed large parts of this Singapore landmark have become more construction sites than hotel but the 33 rooms that remain open continue to keep the staff on their toes good afternoon this is Marvin Hummers issue arrivals are prepared for welcome to and cherished guests attended to it is now December and the season for a long-held tradition the putting up of the raffles Christmas tree okay this year things are a little more humble probably this was last year that was hoping it was bad how many feet is that 19 to 20 that was our last big love eg 19 to 10 this tree may only be six feet tall but it still attracts a crowd [Music] I was just myself but it looks good I would say for the efforts that my guys have put in I have to mr. big long issue is while a tradition is being upheld in the temporary Lobby in the old one they're about to break new ground [Music] making way for a completely new design of this ground space [Music] [Applause] it's gonna be very dusty yeah that's the next thing [Music] amid the destruction guests with the highest standards continue to arrive [Music] well we are in fact has an but with the second restoration to give me a room far away from of course while Rosalie directs the new guest to his room seventy other suites are being stripped back to their bare bones [Music] in the remaining guest wing there appears to be a problem with a hotel's newest resident because I'm a developer and I hate to be a development that oh my god oh I understand that young and this is they have no fuel mm-hmm you know I find out 20 hours to come here and it's a dark room I don't want that I think we also mentioned in the our correspondent with your PA saying that the hotel is actually undergoing the restoration we are operational again fire if you want I can call her now my second fire immediately because I'm know that I hate that second major restoration after 25 years ago yeah so um it's um not pleased with the accommodation how many nights is distressing that your side 20 over hours you see there's little facilities and then in such state now it's not a gun call a five-star hotel you should close hey if the meat is shrunken and then can I tell him II could see inside yeah except when you Kamala is necessarily significant service of such the spaces of register the Commission all says have it isn't in their twenties it's the anniversary yeah yeah Kanzi of kind on the kind instant matsuba in your bones blow spin cuts cuts in part on over there Gavin so front office manager burned perform some managerial magic I failed as his burn from raffles Hotel Singapore on the front of his manager here it's Norman around today and presto a room is found at another hotel fantastic I appreciate faith thank you very much they're unhappy about the fact that the hotel is on the reservations and they weren't aware of it because the information somewhere slipped through the cracks then we have to be understanding and express empathy and make sure that they are not leaving with a bad feeling burned has saved the day he's found the disgruntled guest another hotel and his even arranged for a taxi to get there well the $5,000 just walked out of the door as large parts of the hotel are stripped away raffles reveals of ancient secrets it's up to project director Luke conrick and the project team to fit together some often 130 year old puzzles this is not good is it the waterproofing hasn't worked here that's a joist here right well it's all wet we don't know how long it's been here for while the Timbers around what was once a shower stall will need to be replaced not a single nail can be removed without the approval of Singapore's national heritage enjoy Lauren is the board's designated on-site consultant it's her job to ensure that raffles history is properly preserved it's a really exciting time for us because now you starting to see the layers of history being revealed in a way certain things you may hadn't expected but that's part and parcel of a conservation project when you look up here you can see the original cornice details something that not a lot of people have gotten to see no doubt rattles will reveal a few more secrets before its restoration is complete [Music] today there will be no arrivals only departures zero zero and departure so all the patches needs to be met and we'll take you with better city noise so it's a busy day we still have to make sure that the twelve to purchase that we have still feel like guests and they still have to feeling that we're operating hotel when we checked out yes I said to the champ we'll give you the key to the room when the Chuck Porter's been he says no need it's extinct now you can keep with most of the guests checked out the staff have given them self permission to misbehave just a little [Music] [Applause] [Music] you can see it season's greeting we'll come back home to results every time and that's different hair rife will be the very last person to check out he stayed at the hotel 20 times the almonds here for summoned Sui and had so much and I still attend guest her wife has been a very loyal and valuable guest so he is presented with a golden key to mark his departure thanks to all because you are a great you are nice people and I hope I see a lot of you next year one last lemon one last farewell the final guest is left battles for the moment is

Petersburg Russia's second largest city it's famous for its rivers which are flanked by neoclassical buildings vestiges of a bygone era [Music] it's also the hometown of Vladimir Putin the Russian president was all too happy to show his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping around when he made his eighth state visit to Russia this year they shared a private cruise along this very river and even visited mr. Putin's alma mater where the Chinese president received an honorary Doctorate but that may not have been the highlight of presidencies tour there was one attraction that he was especially eager to visit this is the aurora a decommissioned russian war cruiser which is over a hundred years old while many russians today viewed the ship as just another landmark of the city it holds a special significance among the chinese on board the ship in october 1917 the crew of the aurora launched a mutiny against their captain isara loyalists after killing him and taking over the ship they fired a shot from one of their cannons this event marked the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution some Chinese still today celebrate this event as bringing communism to China what's the significance of presidency and Putin's visit to the ship while say cheese dish or a spa stereo a leash Newport virginia thomas tour Masaru quite easily delays mini mania knows initiation atmosphere there's two stranded is fabulous why is this ship so important to the Chinese they chose Casa to watch the citations to Nikki a nourishing trip did not noise it's a crab Luka poppy remove another oblem revolution the most unique algebra values in volume couturier Laura Doster dog every meal I was precise fearlessly it was strange history hubris eg caribou Chesto leaky partial justo filarsky characteristics of which efficient use of signals to Agoda by atomo key Toscana road on his laces symbol of revolution Simula Mac tabria shops Nagoya initiative that notion solution trip it may seem as Tom Godot via PC cenastone Kadam oprah's municipality this prosto Polynesia Strobel Akita skiff or east of Des Moines asam dilution or are they pretty much the worst at each new coconuts no Marple but China's interests in Russian military vessels is not confined to just history in recent years Moscow has been equipping Beijing with its most advanced weapons and military vehicles they also hold regular joint military exercises on a massive scale the biggest of which was the 2018 Vostok wargames held across Siberia and Russia's Far East with nearly 300,000 troops as well as thousands of aircraft ships and tanks it was the biggest military drill since the Cold War these recent developments underscore a major geopolitical shift the two countries which used to regard each other as military rivals are extending their cooperation beyond economics to defense as well I managed to witness the closeness between the two militaries firsthand while travelling around st.

China Russia relations is perhaps both these two countries will be in a block maybe some other countries for you ampere your America United States and the Europe there will be another blocks which means there will be some more confrontation between two blocks once this kind of thinking I mean to to shape the international order in future I think another will be a tragedy for fully international order because both China and also I believe also for Russia we don't want to go back to so-called Codel period so we need to try you know any kind of effort to stop any kind of visa Trent on other side I think that yes for China it need to take a conservation how could a chance to keep the balance between a different partnerships for example for China they were sure Europe and there was some other players all of them are very important partners with China both China and Russia say they are committed to a multilateral approach and are not pursuing a geopolitical bloc in the meantime the presidents of both countries have already committed to implementing the Bri in a new era of sino-russian cooperation they've met nearly 30 times in the past six years their close friendship has been widely regarded to be the pillar of the strategic partnership but I wonder whether personality based diplomacy is a durable basis for long term relations between two countries which have no unifying links such as culture I discussed this with Gong Jia Jia a senior executive at the Chinese embassy in Russia do you think that the two countries will continue to remain close and in good relations

31,0,How Elon Musk Took Tesla To Hell And Back With The Model 3,"In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want— affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.Over the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit. Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a “hell of a ride,” and he took Wall Street along with him.

The issue is definitely not coming up\nwith a car design, it is absolutely all about building\nthe production system. The difficulty and value of\nmanufacturing is under appreciated. It\'s like relatively easy to make\na prototype and extremely difficult to mass manufacture a vehicle\nreliably and at scale. In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called\nTesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would\ntransform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning\nset out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone\nwould want — affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a\nlow volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money\nand eventually became CEO. You\'re not just buying a sports\ncar, you\'re actually helping pay for development of the\nmass market vehicles. In less than 10 years,\nTesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving\nthe way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and\nTesla looked unstoppable. Tesla has received almost four\nhundred thousand orders from its latest car, the Model Three Sedan. But over the next year, the\ncompany struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing\nwoes, financial losses and volatile decision making\nfrom its CEO. This has been an incredibly\nlong and difficult journey. It\'s been an enormous amount\nof blood, sweat and tears. Today, Tesla forges ahead with\nlofty promises and new vehicles, despite endless lawsuits, mounting\ncompetition and inconsistent manufacturing goals. But Wall Street doesn\'t\nseem to mind. Tesla now at session highs. It is up twenty one percent for\nthe day above nine hundred dollars a share. The ambitions have never been\nbigger and the stakes have never been higher for Elon\nMusk and Tesla. We created Tesla to make\na difference in the world. The world desperately\nneeds sustainable transport. We want to show that electric cars\nare in fact, better than gasoline. Tesla was founded in 2003 and they\nweren\'t founded by anyone who had any automotive experience. It was consumer electronics, software\nand battery tech guys. When we started Tesla, there was\ntwo things in the world everybody knew about electric cars, they\'re\ndead and they suck. Nobody wants to drive one,\nthat\'s why they\'re dead. They\'re slow, short range. They\'re ugly. If you look at the\noriginal business plan we wrote for Tesla, we describe in great\ndetail the Tesla Roadster. And we said once this car\'s successful,\nthe next car we should make, it\'s either a large SUV, an\nexpensive SUV or a large sedan. The sedan market\nis enormously large. It\'s much, much bigger than the\nsports car market, the Roadster market. And then below that is the\nsort of, you know, Model 3 segment of that market. And if you\'re gonna\nhave a big impact, you have to play there. But you can\'t\nstart there because the capital requirements are just too vast and\nyou don\'t know what you\'re doing. You know, you have to learn and\ndevelop the technology along the way. Everything was hard, everything. We were inventing from scratch. This was something that\'d\nnever been done before. We had customers literally say, like,\nthis is the most exciting thing I\'ve been involved in, even though on\nsome level they just wrote a check, but they believed in the\nvision enough to write that check. And now they\'re participating in this\nprocess that we were going through. And then\nwe encountered Elon. Martin and Mark knew that the\nonly other person, perhaps lunatic enough to start something this ambitious\nand join the sort of EV mission with them would be\na guy like Elon Musk. Part of the PayPal mafia, he had\nmade a good deal of money in software, payment tech, and sold\nthat company to eBay. And he was out in Southern\nCalifornia working on an equally ambitious business, SpaceX. One of the great things about pitching\nto Elon in this context is that, a lot of times we would pitch\nto the VCs and to other, you know, angels and they would say what\nyou\'re trying to do is so crazy. You know, you\'re trying to make\nan electric sports car, that\'s insane. And we are pitching to\nsomebody who is actually trying to make rocket ships. And so,\nyou couldn\'t really say that. Right in context, Hh was like,\noh, yeah, I got that. Now next, we have Martin Eberhard, who\nis the CEO of Tesla Motors. And of course, this is one of\nthe great cars, Tesla Roadster, an electric car that gets two hundred\nand fifty miles per charge. A test of this one. You hear how silent it is. There\'s no sound. You can have a car\nthat\'s quick and you can have a car that\'s electric. But having one\nthat\'s both is how you make electric cars popular. I was voted off the island\nand in a rather rude way. When I left Tesla, we had\njust, the Roadster was essentially finished and I\'d been doing nothing but Tesla\nfor five years and I thought it\'s gonna be another five years. And Martin wasn\'t there anymore,\nit wasn\'t as much fun. Sports car maker Tesla Motors. Reuters is reporting this Silicon\nValley electric vehicle is planning to go public soon. If it does,\nit would be the first U.S. automaker to go public since\nFord did back in 1956. Tesla is best known for its\none hundred nine thousand dollar all electric Roadster. At the time Tesla came to us\nin the government, they were actually looking for a loan in order to\nbuild their first facility to create sedans. We ended up lending Tesla\nfour hundred sixty five million dollars. And the real premise of that\nwas to be able to get that industry, the electric car\nindustry, up and running. And even to this day, I would\nargue that we wouldn\'t have hybrid cars and electric cars to the extent that\nwe had if this had not proven out to be a successful\ntransaction and a successful business opportunity. If we were just making the Roadster and\ndoing powertrain business, we\'d be profitable as a company, but we\'re\nin a massive expansion mode. The latest model of the electric\ncar is rolling off Tesla\'s assembly line in California today. The Tesla Model S, delivery\nstarting today in Fremont, California. Tesla is showing off its newest\nvehicle, it is called the X. Tesla unveiled its\nSupercharger network. Musk says Tesla may start construction on\nthree sites as well for its giant battery factory\nor Gigafactory. You don\'t just want to be betting\non this stock, you want to be pushing all in on Tesla. For investors, Tesla has been a wild\nride for a lot of reasons. If you look at the history of\nTesla shares, they really took off starting around 2010 all the\nway up through 2013. That\'s when Elon Musk first said, I\'m\ngoing to build the Model S and then I\'m going to\nbuild the model X. And he laid out a game plan. And when the Model S first came\nout, people might have been skeptical beforehand. But when the reviews came in\nthat this is a solid vehicle that changes the game plan in terms\nof how far you can drive an electric vehicle and what it feels\nlike to drive an electric vehicle, that\'s when shares of\nTesla took off. Over the last couple of years,\nshares of Tesla have been extremely volatile. People sometimes get carried\naway with our stock. You know, honestly. If you care about the long term Tesla,\nI think the stock is a good price. If you look about the\nshort term, it\'s less clear. Well, I\'ve been calling\nit a cold stock. I said last night it\'s\nlike a wide receiver. I mean, you want them in your fantasy,\nlike what am I going to say? It\'s a fantasy\nstock that\'s reality. I think we have to continue to\ntake a wait and see mode. Tesla is so highly\nvalued at this point. You know, Tesla is still a small\ncar maker in a small niche market. The problem for some investors when they\nlook at Tesla is that they see a company that continues to\nburn through cash and they constantly are asking themselves, when will this\ncompany turn a profit and sustain a profit? It\'s not enough to be profitable for\none quarter in the eyes of some investors. They want to see a\ncompany that is solidly profitable quarter after quarter\nafter quarter. Tesla has been in its stock. It\'s been a story stock. There\'s been a lot of, you\nknow, sentiment and positive sentiment around its CEO and founder, who\'s\na massive holder, 22 percent ownership in Tesla. Elon Musk has made himself into\nthe face of the brand. Tesla fans love him and\nfollow his every business. Mr. Musk, how are you? Congratulations on the promotion. Thank you very much. Those Merlin engines are fantastic. Oh thank you, got an\nidea for an electric jet. You do? Yeah. Then\nwe\'ll make it work. I really deeply believed in the vision\nthat the company had and the vision that Elon had set,\nwhich was accelerating the world\'s transition to sustainable energy. That\'s what inspired me to join. And I think that\'s what inspired\nmany people at Tesla to join. I did get to meet Elon a\ncouple times, which was so exciting. The first time I ever saw him, he\nwas wearing a Duff shirt from The Simpsons, their beer brand. And I was like this dude\'s cool. I already know that. Where you from, boss? Michigan. Oh Michigan, you\'re in\nthe car business? Uh no, no. Printing. Elon Musk. Elon Musk? Tesla Elon Musk? Yeah. Wow. I love space. I love the idea\nof space exploration. So all of his\nSpaceX stuff fascinated me. The solar power, just pretty much\neverything that Elon has done, I absolutely loved. So the idea of working\nfor him and having his name on my paychecks was just\nso cool to me. What an honor to meet you. I\'m such a fan of Tesla\nand SpaceX, all your companies. I\'m Howard Wolowitz, Caltech. Nice to meet you Howard. To\nthe extent that Tesla benefits from Elon\'s many side projects, and SpaceX\nis not a side project, SpaceX is a massive focus for him,\nit\'s a big, serious company. I think you could probably\ncategorize Boring Company, Neuralink, OpenAI, Hyperloop, Pravda and a memes\nweb site, whatever else is coming out of his\nimagination as side projects. But there is an argument that what\nis good for his celebrity is good for the company. People see him\nas this great visionary genius that\'s very into the details of all\nthese companies, when in reality, I really see him as a great champion\nof these causes and a great motivator of people and a great\nidentifier of talent, and he relies on these people to keep\nhis public perception alive. But some investors question whether\nhe has enough operational expertise and focus on Tesla to lead\nthe company in the role of CEO. Elon Musk has some\ngood news for you. He tweeted a cheaper mass-market Tesla\nwill start at thirty five thousand dollars. The company will\nbegin taking pre-orders for the Model 3 in March. Don\'t get too excited, Musk cautions\nproduction won\'t begin for about two years. Then going from the S and\nthe X, we finally come to we\'ve come to step three or the final step\nin the master plan, which is a mass market affordable,\naffordable car. Do you want to see the car? Well, we don\'t have\nit for you tonight. I\'m just kidding, of course. Or you will not be able to buy\na better car for thirty five thousand dollars or even close. One astonishing thing about the launch of\nthe Model 3 was how many preorders came in immediately after\nthe company unveiled this. The total number of orders for the Model\n3 in the past 24 hours has now passed a hundred\nand fifteen thousand. We found dozens of people\nlined outside the automaker\'s Chelsea showroom, hoping to put their name\non the list for $1,000 dollars. Potential buyers can reserve one\nof Tesla\'s new affordable vehicles. I got up at 4 in the morning to\ncome here to put money down on a car that I have not seen\nbecause it\'s a Tesla. Model 3 could be the first model\nthat really opens up electric cars to the masses, to the mass market. The reason I say that is Tesla\nhas gotten hundreds of thousands of deposits on this car, the likes\nof which, numbers that is, we\'ve never seen happen\nwith electric cars. It could be a tipping point not\njust for Tesla, but for the automotive industry. The Model 3 was\na huge turning point for Tesla because they\'re starting to get\ninto economies of scale. Manufacturing a car that is intended\nfor the masses instead of your early adopters and people that want\nto drive a beautiful sports car is a completely different affair than\nmaking a niche high end vehicle. Now how are we\ngoing to make these cars? OK. Good question. Going from\nannouncing a vehicle to actually building it, it was a very short\nperiod of time, so short that I think Tesla realized this is not going\nto happen as quickly as we expected. Tesla had lots of pressure,\nto produce a low cost car. And as soon as the design of\nthe vehicle was at least viable enough to show the public and viable enough\nto know that it could be produced, it was released\nto the public. Most manufacturers don\'t release cars\nthat early, they don\'t release the whole vehicle, they don\'t give\nspecs, they don\'t give prices. When that happened, the manufacturing part,\nhow to build the car, was first really being thought of. So when, when are deliveries? Well, they\'re next year. So I do feel fairly confident\nthat it will be next year. Welcome back, everybody. Today, Tesla\nis making the first deliveries of its Model 3. And this is\nthe day that Tesla fans and customers have been waiting for. The delivery\nof the first Model 3s. The first of Tesla\'s Model 3\nis getting delivered over the weekend, but most buyers will have to wait\nat least a year before getting behind the wheel of\nElon Musk\'s latest creation. Production grows exponentially, so in\nAugust there should be a hundred cars, September\nabove 15 hundred. And then what happens after that? Well, eventually, by the end of\nDecember, the production rate, at least according to Elon Musk,\nwill be twenty thousand vehicles. Thing that\'s gonna be a major challenge for us over the next\nsix to nine months is how do we build a huge number of cars? Frankly, we\'re gonna be\nin production hell. The Model 3 was expected to be in\nmass production by the end of 2017. It wasn\'t. It was a disaster. And so you had for a year,\nproduction hell where Tesla was struggling to just build these cars for all\nthese people who had deposits down. When I said manufacturing hell and\nsupply chain hell on Friday, I meant it. I mean, you know, but we\nknow this, signed up for it, not blaming hell, because we\nbought the ticket. One of the things which I think\nTesla does which is maybe a detriment to it, is it tries to\ndo everything itself and in-house. In the Model 3 process, we decided\nwe were gonna build cars better than any other auto manufacturer out\nthere instead of just building what was sort of industry\nstandard and guaranteed to work Tesla\'s plan for innovating manufacturing\nwas all about technology. They seem to think that humans were\nthe problem and that if you just had robots in there,\neverything would be better. We did go too far on the\nautomation front and automated some pretty silly things. We tried to automate\nthe placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the\nbattery pack, which is ridiculous. So we had Flufferbot, which\nwas really an incredibly difficult machine to make work. Machines are not\ngood at picking up pieces of fluff. Tesla eventually removed most\nof the automation that delivered parts to the line, and they ended\nup going to an industry standard of moving them by pallet and fork\ntruck and things of that nature, because it was way more reliable,\nhad less issues and complications in terms of bringing\nit up to scale. We started running Model 3 a\nlot, I would say, November-December of 2017. February-March we started ramp, the ramp\nup of Model 3 and we started running a lot of Model 3s. There were probably 500,000 orders of the\nModel 3, so we knew there was a lot of pressure under\nus to get those cars out. A lot of us, I think, were willing\nto do what it took to get those big numbers out because we really\nwanted this company to succeed. In the process, they were so desperate\nto get that back on track, they ended up building a\nfactory in a tent. They ended up making this outdoor\nline that is one hundred percent done by humans. There\'s no robots. They don\'t they don\'t do anything. We have a couple hydraulic lifts,\nstuff to help assist us with putting tires on the car, putting the glass\non top, but it is an 100 percent manual line for\nthe Model 3. The company is under tremendous pressure to\ncrank out as many cars as possible. And so it creates a\nworkplace that can be very chaotic, that is, you know, making\nchanges on the fly. You have workers who are being\nthrown into positions where they say they haven\'t been trained for. They\'re getting hurt on the job. They\'re working tremendously long hours\nand they\'re struggling to keep up with these demands. I myself had two instances of\nheat exhaustion, one which was taken care of, the other one which I\nwas left to basically suffer it out until I literally walked off the line\nand went outside for 45 minutes because I looked like\nI\'d taken a shower. And I was in my paint suit\nand I was soaked through and through. I had to walk out\nbecause I was sick. I got written up for it,\nfor walking off the line. Even though I had 20 text messages\nto my boss telling him, you guys are going to carry me out\nof here on a stretcher. I think we should scrutinize them\nif they\'re really doing something fraudulent and they\'re doing like\npunishing people or slaving them. But things happen at the workplace. Working conditions are hard. When I worked at Tesla, we worked at\nthe end of the assembly line in a room that had\nno ventilation, no windows. We had, you know, crappy\ncereal, we had crappy coffee. I\'m not saying no one cared. But most people were not saying, well,\nthat\'s not why I\'m here, I\'m not here for the cereal, I\'m\nnot here for the coffee. I\'m here to change the world. They were supposed to be building half\na million of those cars a year at the Fremont factory by the end\nof 2018, and they still aren\'t there yet. As they\'re trying to get the Model\n3 production off the ground, Elon Musk makes a grand announcement that\nTesla is going to acquire a business that he also\nhelped co-found, SolarCity. Then there\'s Tesla today, offering\nto acquire SolarCity, and this stock deal valued it up to $2.8 billion. Musk is the chairman,\nthe largest shareholder of both companies, as you know, and\nhe\'s calling the combination a no-brainer. We think there\'s really a\nhuge opportunity here to have a highly integrated, sustainable energy company\nthat answers the whole sustainable energy question from generation\nof power to storage to transport. What is with the\ntiming of this deal? We\'re also talking about SolarCity\nshares, which are perhaps not nearly as high as they have been\nover the course of the past couple of years. All I can say is\nthis, that SolarCity would have gone even lower if he hadn\'t made this bid. On paper, what Elon Musk\nlaid out made sense. He was going to use SolarCity to\nramp up sales of solar panels at home to push the development of\nsolar technology that could be used in a number of different venues. That hasn\'t happened. This is sort of\nthe integrated future. You\'ve got a electric car,\na Powerwall and a solar roof. The key is that it needs\nto be beautiful, affordable and seamlessly integrated. I think we really started to\nsee some of the the wheels come off, no pun intended,\nwith the acquisition of SolarCity. And that, I think, really brought\nto light how intertwined Elon\'s personal wealth, personal interest, ego\nand brand were in this company. The directorships of others\nand the potential conflicts are quite significant. Lyndon Rive, who\'s\nthe CEO and co-founder, and Peter Rive are brothers,\nthey\'re both Musk\'s cousins. John Fisher\'s fund is a SpaceX\ninvestor, of course, another Musk company. Jeffrey Straubel is a Tesla\nemployee and a SpaceX investor. Nancy Pfund was a director at Tesla\nprior to it having gone public. By the way, Tesla did an\noffering six weeks ago, those shareholders must not be particularly happy, though\none wonders whether he had any idea he was going to do this. It just felt a little bit too\nconvenient that Tesla got to absorb this company that he had funded and\nwas run by his cousins and was going to add enormous financial\nstrain to Tesla and enormous complexity at a time when it already\nhad a lot of complexity to deal with. This is the worst corporate\ngovernance I\'ve ever seen in my career in a company. The SolarCity bailout is just an\nabomination and they should be held to account for that. And they\nshouldn\'t be liable for that, because it was nothing but a bailout. Let\'s stay focused on SolarCity. I mean, I love Tesla by the way, I\nown a Tesla myself so it\'s - love the car, but lets stay focused. Exactly. Tesla has gone from production\nhell to delivery, logistics hell. That tweet was in response to\na customer complaint about a delivery delay. But in truth, if in fact\nthat\'s the case, that is progress for the company. One problem for Tesla\nas it\'s trying to deliver these vehicles is that they\'re supplying\ncustomers around the world from one plant in California. Other automakers rely on outsourced\ndelivery companies that will take your car from the factory to the\ndealer and make sure everything\'s in good order. Tesla\'s doing\nit all themselves. In fact, they don\'t\nwork with dealers. They run all their own\nstores and service centers. We had wanted a Tesla for a\nlong time and we were pretty excited about it and it just made\nsense for our new commute. But we took delivery in the dark and\nwe didn\'t really get to see the vehicle until the next day. The next day I took it to work,\nit was a bright, sunny day and unfortunately it showcased what was\nan absolutely horrendous paint job like, I have no idea how they\ngot it off the line, how they would put it into the\nhands of a customer. I mean, it was insane. Now the\nTesla has hundreds of thousands of cars on the road and they\'re\ngoing after a mainstream consumer instead of just early adopters. They have a much\nhigher service burden. And the problem is they haven\'t\nreally scaled service in tandem with that. I was fed up with Tesla\ncompletely to the point to where today, if they want to touch my\ncar, they\'re not allowed to touch my car. I\'ll do my own\nwork on my car now. As soon as I exceeded my\nwarranty period, the help, kindness, interactions all went away. I was treated like I didn\'t\neven really own a Tesla. So in terms of the service part\nof Tesla, I do get nervous. When many owners try to schedule\na service appointment, the service centers are stretched thin and appointments\ncould be weeks out before a car gets into service. The reason why I started my YouTube\nchannel was to kind of demystify Teslas in general. Tesla wasn\'t\nreally sharing much information about them in terms of what\'s inside\nof them and how they worked. So I figured to myself, people\nmay actually be interested in this. So as I started tearing into the\ncar more and more, I started taking detailed photos of\nthings, detailed videos. This blue connector goes\nback in the door. And just kind of\ntook off from there. This is my Tesla parts storage. This is where all the used parts\nor crash parts, I save every little piece. I worked at Tesla from May\nof 2009 through February of 2013. I started out as a service\nmanager for the Seattle area. Part of the reason people are\nhaving trouble getting their cars repaired is there\naren\'t enough parts. Now specifically with the Roadster,\nthere aren\'t any parts. And with the newer models, there\njust isn\'t enough parts coming off the assembly line or being reproduced to\nfix the cars that are in the body shops. There\'s a local body shop\nhere that has, at times, has over 100 Model 3s\nthat need paint work. I have no problem with\nthem being vertically integrated. I have no problem with them running\nthings the way that they do for cars that are in warranty. But if they want to be in\nthe mass market, unless they\'re going to run every single service center in\nevery single little small town, there\'s no way it\'s acceptable to\nhave people for minor issues drive and kill an entire day to go\nto the service center and get free Keurig coffee. The genesis of the\nelectrified garage was such that a lot of people started reaching out\nto me because of the YouTube channel, people that wanted to get\nissues resolved with their Teslas. And at the time, Tesla was super\nbusy, they didn\'t have time to get people in for appointments. So they started reaching out to me\nand saying, hey, Tesla\'s too busy to take a look at this or I\nown a salvaged vehicle, can you take a look at my electric vehicle? We\'re hoping the demand is really\nstrong and we\'re hoping to grow this into more of a franchise\ntype business and almost work alongside Tesla to actually repair a lot of\ntheir vehicles as well, because at this point, they need all the\nhelp that they could get. One thing Tesla has done to\naddress the gaps between service centers that may be far apart and hard\nfor customers to come into is to launch this mobile ranger service. These are technicians that come to\nyou, customers who can get their issues fixed by the mobile service\nlove it, but they can\'t do everything. Over the last year, Tesla\nramped its service locations by about 20 percent. And again, Tesla is expecting about\na five fold increase in the number of cars that it\'s\ngoing to be shipping. So we\'re just not sure that the\nramp is going to be significant enough. Service totally matters\nto Tesla\'s long-term success. The proposition for the customer of a\nModel 3 is buy at your own risk. This might\ncome with problems. At the scale it is at now with how\nmany Model 3s that are out in the market, and who its core customer\nis, there are enough people out there to buy it with that caveat,\nbut that grace period isn\'t going to last forever. And so Tesla does\nneed to sort these problems out before it becomes truly mainstream. I talked to a lot of people who\nhave Tesla vehicles and service is a problem. And you know, everybody\'s, ""Oh\nTesla service is a problem."" Microsoft had no customer\nservice for years. Google had no customer\nservice for years. Apple customer service, until they\ngot the stores, was mostly non-existent. Right? This is not a Tesla unique\nproblem, this is an industry unique problem. Technology companies aren\'t\ngood at service, period. Stop calling out Tesla for this\nbecause they\'re a tech company. They\'re not really a car company. The cheaper models like the Model\n3, they\'re all over the place. You just have to have a service.\nTesla needs to step up and provide them that service\nthat they deserve. And if they provide the\nservice they deserve, Tesla\'s unstoppable. Let me tell you, this is going\nto blow this staircase out of the water. I mean, this car will\nleave a Ferrari in its dust. I think Elon\'s Eloness has\nincreased over the years. Yeah, I mean, if you wanted to\ndescribe Elon Musk in a nutshell, I don\'t think he would\nfit in a nutshell. It\'s like Elon Musk has been beamed\ndown from another planet to show us mortals how to run,\nhow to run a company. Elon Musk is a divisive\ncharacter because he\'s a difficult personality. Sometimes he\'s extremely chummy\nand he\'s the best person to be around. And you love his\npoints of view and his opinions and the things he says,\nand he\'s actually funny. Other times, he\'s a complete dick. There are times when he\nis arrogant and obnoxious and insulting. Of the reservations that\nhave actually opened and made available to configure. Can you let\nus know like what, how, what percentage have actually taken\nsteps to configure? We\'re going to go\nto YouTube. Sorry. These questions are just so dry. They\'re killing me. How many executives\nor top executives have left this company in the\nlast couple of years? By some estimates, it\'s between 40 and\n50 who have left the company under Elon Musk\'s watch over\nthe last couple of years. Most people confuse Elon\'s management style\nwith his vision in a sense. So what Elon\'s trying to do\nis trying to inspire people to come work on a\nreally difficult problem. In my opinion, at least he runs\ninto issues, is trying to do that while at the same\ntime maintaining operational excellence. I\'ve been on a couple of meetings\nwith Elon Musk where people that have disagreed with him have no longer,\nyou know, you never saw them the next day for going that way. And that\'s what Elon Musk does. We\'re going that way and either you\'re\ngoing that way or you\'re not going. He\'s a great innovator,\nhe\'s a great visionary. I don\'t necessarily think\nhe\'s a great leader. I don\'t even have a desk or\nan office anymore, I just basically, I\'m just basically standing on the\nproduction floor and occasionally meeting in a conference room. We have seen\nhim at the end of the line wearing a Tesla t-shirt and steel\ntoed boots and safety glasses and bump cap, working with the\npeople, doing the physical labor. When the S and X were launched,\nhe was, he literally had a sleeping bag at the end of the line\nbecause he didn\'t even want to leave. He was there so often working on the\ncars just to make them right and to make sure that they were as\ngood as they could possibly be and that production was working. He was there all the time. He\nslept there and it was true. If your CEO has to be fixing\nproblems on the production line, no matter how brilliant he is or how\ngreat his solutions are, there\'s a systemic failure that\'s taken place\nto reach that point. The whole point of running a giant\ncompany is to make sure that the whole thing runs as much as\npossible in an orderly fashion, an efficient fashion, in a profitable\nfashion, without requiring the constant personal attention of\nany one person. He should find a partner as quickly\nas possible who serves the same role at Tesla that Gwynne Shotwell\ndoes at SpaceX, a stabilizing force and making that company made up\nof humans who have to work together as good as\nTesla\'s cars are. Another Twitter rant\nfrom Elon Musk. This time it\'s\nabout media companies. He accuses them of hypocrisy and\nsays the public no longer respects them. Elon Musk, for most of\nhis career at Tesla, has embraced Twitter. He believes it is his\ndirect way of communicating with customers, with fans, and\nto take on critics. I think Elon spends too much time\nobsessing about the media and the media\'s views on him. The media has mostly been\nextremely helpful to Tesla. It\'s free marketing for\nthe company, essentially. Tesla has a lot of fanboys who\nhave their own kind of media setups, whether they be influential Twitter\naccounts or YouTube channels or blogs that don\'t do anything except\ntell the world how wonderful Elon Musk is. So we tend to have a lot\nof people that are huge fans and a lot of people that just hate us. And I\'m hoping over time we can\nconvince some of the people that hate us to hate us less. I don\'t think that we felt that\nproduction was going to kill the company as much as, I think\nif anything, we thought that Elon\'s stupidity with Twitter would\nkill the company. The race to rescue a teenage soccer\nteam stranded in a flooded cave in Thailand continues. The options to get them out are few,\nand all of them are quite risky. He called a guy with\nprobably zero basis a pedophile. He called him out on Twitter.\nHe repeated it to the media. These are not the behaviors\nof some milquetoast, traditional chief executive. We start with the tweet heard\nround the world, or at least around Wall Street. CEO Elon Musk\ncreating chaos with a single tweet, quote, ""I\'m considering\ntaking Tesla private. Four hundred twenty dollars funding secured"",\nwhich led to the stock soaring and then being halted\nand then soaring once again. Let\'s go to Leslie Picker. With\none tweet, he created stock price movements of huge amounts\nboth up and down. Let\'s get right to your top money\nin business story this mornin g, and that is Tesla.\nThe stock is tumbling. It is down almost\n10 percent right now. It\'s all on news that broke\n",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ate yesterday, the SEC suing the company\'s CEO and founder,\nElon Musk, for fraud. The SEC alleges that Elon Musk\nmade false and misleading tweets in August where he said he was\nconsidering taking Tesla private at four hundred and twenty dollars and\nthat funding was secured. Let\'s get to our corporate story of\nthe morning, I should say, of the weekend. Tesla founder and CEO Elon\nMusk and the SEC, reaching a settlement deal. He gives up the\nchairmanship for three years. Two new independent directors will be\nappointed to the Tesla board. Both Elon Musk and Tesla\nboth paying $20 million fines. And this is the\nmost interesting one. There will be oversight by a\ncommittee of Elon Musk\'s communications. I guess this means we\'re not going\nto get as many Twitter bombs in the middle of the night as we\'ve\nseen over the last couple of years. That was a 20 million dollar tweet. That\'s 20 million dollars that could\nhave been doled out in profit-sharing or any other way. You saw the confrontation with\nthe SEC, which whenever entrepreneurs in the valley start attacking\nthe government or regulatory authorities or traditional stakeholders\nin a way that\'s counterproductive, it ends up being a\nbig problem for a company longer term. It shows that they\'re\nso looped into the vision that they\'re not thinking about the\npragmatic operation and functioning of the business. He\'s got an oversized\npersonality which gets him in trouble on Twitter occasionally. But he also has a vision and\nhe\'s pushing not just his employees, but he\'s pushing the industry. Tesla shares tanking Friday after a\nbombshell interview with CEO Elon Musk. Shares plunging 9 percent right\ninto a bear market, again on track for its worst\nweek since March. Billionaire Elon Musk of Tesla and\nSpaceX fame Like we\'ve never seen him before. Smoking pot on YouTube. Tesla CEO Elon Musk appearing on\na podcast with comedian Joe Rogan last night, overnight. And yes, he smoked up. Take a look. So is that a joint? Or is it a cigar? No. OK. It\'s marijuana\ninside of tobacco. OK. So it\'s like posh pot tobacco. Yeah, you never had that? Yeah,\nI think I tried one once. Come on, man. You probably can\'t because\nstockholders, r ight? I mean, it\'s legal,\nright? Totally legal. OK. How does that work? Do people get upset at you\nif you do certain things? I\'m not touching this stock\nat this point in time. The stock has clearly not found\nits footing by any stretch. Elon is absolutely off his rocker,\nwhether it\'s tweets or whatever he\'s recently doing. I mean, maybe the pressure is getting\nto him, but his behavior just seems odd. Tesla founder and CEO\nElon Musk sitting for a rare interview with Lesley Stahl on\nthis Sunday\'s 60 Minutes program. I want to be clear, I\ndo not respect the SEC. I do not respect them. But you\'re abiding by\nthe settlement, aren\'t you? Because I respect\nthe justice system. There are people who who say\nthat the company cannot survive without you. I don\'t think that\'s true. Yeah. And there are people who\nsay the company cannot survive with you. Haha, that\'s hilarious. They say it because of the\nway you acted over the summer. D oing things that\nseemed impulsive un-CEOish. Well, first of all, I am somewhat\nimpulsive and I don\'t really want to try to adhere\nto some CEO template. That\'s just the character\nthat Elon is. And it\'s really difficult to sto\np him being like that. I don\'t think he\'s ever going to. He\'s a divisive figure because\nhe is a divisive person. Those who are here and those who\nare watching, thank you very much for your support over the years. It\'s been a hell of a ride. And I love you too. I love you too. All cars being produced have the,\nhave all the hardware necessary, compute and otherwise,\nfor full self-driving. I feel very confident predicting\nautonomous robo-taxis for Tesla next year. I just keep finding that it\'s\na three ring circus with the guy and it\'s it\'s kind of\nannoying, but he\'s exciting. I mean he\'s P.T. Barnum, OK? You know, Barnum did\npack the seats. Yeah, but he is P.T. Barnum, P.T. Musk. Elon Musk and Tesla used\nto talk up the green angle. Now, the focus is\nshifting to autonomous. We care about\none thing, self-driving. And we expect to be confident enough\nfrom our standpoint to say that we think people do not need to\ntouch the wheel, look out at the window, sometime probably around the\nsecond quarter of next year. When I first started at Tesla autopilot\nwas this very new concept for them. It was something that wasn\'t in\ntheir branding when I bought my car in 2012 at all. I\'ve never felt that that was\na core part of Tesla, autopilot. But it has become that now. The complete version of autopilot is\nalready in the market for sale, even though the features\nare not available. He\'s great at turning consumers\ninto investors as well. A man in Minnesota is blaming\nhis car crash on Tesla\'s autopilot feature. A Tesla sedan in autopilot\nmode crashed into a parked police cruiser yesterday in Laguna Beach,\nCalifornia, which is in Orange County. Thousands of people in the\nAlmaden Valley were without power tonight after a Tesla crashed\ninto a power pole. There it is right\nthere, sparking a fire. She was on automatic\npilot when it happened. Tesla\'s autopilot has been both a great\npromise, as well as a huge headache for this company. Teslas, they\'re electric vehicles. Fire departments are still figuring out how\nto put out a pure battery electric fire. The other question\nis how much Tesla\'s autopilot systems were involved in\na crash potentially. This is frontier technology, people\nare trying to understand it. So Tesla is weathering\na lot of scrutiny. The other challenge with autopilot is\nthe question of whether or not drivers were fully briefed, were fully\naware of the limitations of the technology. Did drivers understand\nthat this technology could be used in certain select situations? Or did they go into this thinking, I\ncan take my hands off the wheel anywhere? It\'s better\ncruise control . A true self-driving car would be one\nthat I could say, go to the school, pick up the kids\nand take them to writing. We don\'t even know how\nfar we are from that. I don\'t know if you know\nthat Roomba ships 2 million autonomous vacuum cleaners a year. I think at some level, the Roomba\nand the self-driving car are at about the same level. Another thing that\'s challenging to them\nis the build up of lawsuits. Any growing automotive company is\ngoing to see this. But Tesla is dealing with a pretty\nhigh volume of lawsuits from small claims to stockholder litigation. Elon Musk scoring a legal win, all\nrelated to a tweet he posted more than a year ago. That SolarCity deal remains\ncontroversial to this day. There\'s stockholder litigation against Tesla\nthat alleges it was a bad deal that never\nshould have happened. So the fact that he survived the\ncrash when he made eye contact for them to save them is haunting. He built that plant in 10 months. That\'s extraordinary. The future of\nany car company is inextricably tied to the future of\nthe auto industry in China. China is about 12 to 15\npercent of Tesla\'s car sales globally. And China is a very\nexciting market for them. Their penetration in the auto, especially\nin the battery EV market, is still very, very low. So I think they can have\na long way to go. I feel a successful Gigafactory 3 in\nChina would allow Tesla to shift much of the production for rest\nof world and maybe potentially even North America, i f\nthe economics makes sense. The Chinese customer loves the look\nand feel of the vehicle. Elon Musk is sort of a beloved\ncharacter there, and it\'s a luxury brand in a market\nthat values luxury brands. Tesla is a company with grand plans,\na grand vision, but they don\'t yet have the proof that Elon Musk\nand his team can get there consistently. Look, can this company\nviably and economically make cars going forward? We believe the\nworld\'s going electric. We believe that they\'re showing increasingly\nthat they can make these cars profitably. That makes us feel modestly better\nabout the stock, l onger term. Tesla it was like, it was like\nlistening to a call from a real company that made cars\nand made money. The stock price literally influences\nthe future of this company. As long as there are enough believers\nand Musk can raise capital, I wouldn\'t count him out. I don\'t think this\nis about Elon anymore. I think this is about what\'s going\non in the market with cars. You know, consumers are going\ntowards premium and sustainable solutions, they\'re willing to\npay for that sustainability. Tesla hitting an all time high\nafter reporting it delivered 367,000 cars last year. Tesla today on track to open\nat a new record high. C ompany announces a program to build\nthe Model Y SUV at its Shanghai Gigafactory, delivering its first China built\nModel 3 cars to the public, and during that ceremony, i f\nyou haven\'t seen it by now, Musk expresses his joy by dancing\nonstage, proceeding to strip off his jacket, reveal a t-shirt with\na cartoon of the factory. The stock surging and posted its\nfirst ever back-to-back net profits. Earning two dollars and 14 cents\na share in the fourth quarter. The estimate in the\nstreet, a buck 72. So well above expectations there. Revenue also coming in better\nthan expected at 7.3 8 billion dollars. In six months, Tesla\nhas almost quadrupled. And dollar trading volume yesterday was\na record for an individual stock. I just can\'t\nbelieve this frickin\' stock. It\'s insane. This is a big\nseparation from what you know, those of us like to pull out\nthe calculators and and look at reality. The valuation is absurd. The balance sheet is a disaster. I don\'t think their total addressable\nmarket is big enough for the company to capitalize on. And sooner or later, those balance\nsheet obligations are going to come back to bite them. He changed\nthe conversation on Tesla from one about whether it can meet its obligations\nand meet its goals to one of, what\'s the future? Is there going to\nbe bulletproof pickup trucks? Is it going to be a factory\nin China that\'s spitting out hundreds of thousands of cars on its way\nto millions of cars a year? That\'s a lot of expectation\nand excitement for Tesla. I think global warming is a\nvery serious issue and it\'s something that we have to address, and the only\nway to address that is, is to come up with a car that\ndoesn\'t add carbon emissions to the environment. And I think the way\nto do that is with electric vehicles. Our goal all along has been to\ntry to get the rest of the car industry to go electric. So it\'s extremely rewarding to see that\nthe rest of the industry is going electric. This is great. Great. This is just the start for\nTesla, and I think that when they really want to drum up demand for\nthese cars, they can start turning on the burners and start\nto see results pretty quickly. We saw this with\nthe Prius in California. It started off as a very\nCalifornia centric car for eco-minded middle class people and has spread\nall over the world now. But the Prius is not a sexy car. It\'s not really a desirable car. The Model 3 is a sexy car. Tesla earning top marks in new\ncrash tests by the Insurance Institute Highway Safety. The Model 3, the\nfirst of Tesla\'s vehicles to win that top safety rating. It\'s a bit\nof a vindication, we should say, for the company and for Elon Musk,\nwhich, of course, was accused of making some misleading safety claims\nby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Would Ford and GM and all\nthese companies be producing electric cars if Tesla hadn\'t done it\nfirst and showed them how? He\'s pushed all these legacy\ncompanies to begin to innovate. That is a good thing.\nTesla could die tomorrow. They could run out of money, they\ncould close up and disappoint all of their investors tomorrow, and they\nwould still have been a force for good on the planet because\nof all these legacy companies that they pushed. Musk it turns out is a\ngreat CEO when he can get out of his own way, and that seems\nto be what he\'s doing. If the Model 3 w as Tesla\'s\nbiggest turning point to date, there\'s so much that has to go right to make\nthat car and the next batch of projects a success. Oh my god, well maybe that was a little too hard. You know, I think there are a lot\nof things these days that are very difficult to predict. Tesla is probably\neasier to predict, and I still have no idea whether or\nnot they\'re going to succeed. You look back 10 years from\ntoday to 2010, we will produce approximately a thousand times more cars\nin 2020 than we produced in 2010. A thousand. So, where will we be in 10 years? Very exciting to\nconsider the prospect. Today, w hen people think of electric\ncars, they think of, well, of course it\'s faster than\nother cars, it\'s electric. And that\'s because of what we did. We changed the way the world thought\nabout electric cars as what they could be, and we restarted the\nEV revolution in the world. There were no car companies, at\nleast of any significance ," making electric cars when we\nwhen we started Tesla. And now they all are.\nEvery one of them.']""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2019 U.S. airlines carried an estimated 926\nmillion passengers a 43 percent increase from 2003. But that demand hit a wall\nin March 2020 after U.S. airlines reported an enormous drop\nin bookings amid the spread of the\ncoronavirus outbreak. Health officials say air travel\nis causing viruses and bacteria to spread around the\nworld faster than ever before. Air travel does hasten\nthe speed with which infectious disease spreads\naround the world. Airplanes are efficient vectors for\ngerms and bacteria and viruses to spread. The dawn of air travel\nmeant that pandemics can happen, they can happen\nmuch more quickly. Airlines at the center of\nthe epidemic have come under intense scrutiny for the safety\nand cleanliness of their cabins. Demand is just falling\noff and it\'s alarming. This is the worst crisis that\nhe has ever seen in the airline industry. Airlines are\ngoing to stop flying. An airline without\nrevenues is toast. Delta Airlines plans to reduce\nseat capacity by 70 percent and announced the carriers second\nquarter revenue would be $10 billion less than the\nsame period the year prior. American, United, JetBlue and\nSouthwest are also parking some of their planes, freezing\nhiring and asking employees to take unpaid time off. To combat the pandemic airlines\nhave imposed new safety regulations and are using\nenhanced cleaning techniques inside their plane cabins. But is it enough? And how\ndo airlines keep their planes clean? Airlines face an uphill battle\nkeeping their planes clean. Mosquitoes carrying diseases like\nmalaria and yellow fever can sneak aboard planes. To combat bugs and other\npests the World Health Organization and the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization have advised airlines\nto use aircraft disinsection, a term that refers\nto the process of spraying an aircraft cabin\nwith insecticide while passengers are on board\nor after they\'ve disembarked. But it\'s primarily the job of\nthe cabin cleaning crew to prepare your seat for\nits next flight. Cabin cleaners may be inside a\nplane for as little as seven minutes and as long\nas four hours. It all depends on the\nstandard set by each individual airline and the amount of\ntime before the next flight. Deep cleaning when every inch\nof the plane is cleaned, happens overnight when an aircraft\nis parked at an airport. Though cleaning standards vary\nairline to airline, most carriers follow a\nfew basic procedures. Cabin cleaners today generally\nare outfitted with protective clothing and disposable\ngloves, similar to what you see here. A single aisle\nairplane like the Boeing 737 seats up to 230 passengers and\nmight have between three to six people cleaning the cabin,\nplus others cleaning the galleys and lavatory. The bigger Boeing 747 has more\nthan 400 seats and there could be as many as\n20 people cleaning the plane. Depending on the amount of time\nthey have before the next flight cabin cleaners will pick\nup trash like used tissues and half-eaten sandwiches, clean\nsurfaces like tray tables, seat cushions and lavatories\nwith an anti-bacterial solution and even\nvacuum the carpet. Despite these efforts, some people\nare so concerned about germs that they clean\ntheir own seats. In July 2019, Naomi Campbell\'s\nYouTube page launched a video of her airport routine. U.S. airlines have some employees who\nclean their planes but to save money, the vast majority\nof cabin cleaning work is outsourced to dozens of\ncompanies across the U.S. In 2018, nearly two-thirds of\ncabin cleaners worked for third-party companies. Airlines often award contracts\nto the lowest bidder. I mean, essentially what the\nairlines have setup through contracting is they forced the\ncontractors to compete for who can provide the service of\ncabin cleaning, as well as some of the other airline\njobs, at the lowest bid. And that means who can pay the\nworkers the least to do the work because that\'s how the\ncontractors cut their costs. There are dozens of companies\ninvolved in cabin cleaning at the almost 500 commercial\nairports across the country. One of the biggest cabin\ncleaners is ABM, a facility management firm and a public\ncompany that works with leading U.S. airlines and cleans\nmore than 1.3 million planes annually. In 2019, ABM had aviation revenue\nof $1 billion, an almost 20 percent increase from 2016. Aviation revenue at ABM came\nfrom cabin cleaning, but also from other services like\nparking, passenger assistance and catering logistics. In 2015, United Airlines launched\nUnited Ground Express, a subsidiary owned by the\ncarrier that provides customer service, cargo services and\ncabin cleaning for some flights. The other top cabin\ncleaning companies in the U.S. are a mix of private and\npublic companies that offer a range of services from\nde-icing airplanes to baggage handling. Those companies include DGS,\nnow known as Unifi Service, Prospect, Prime Flight,\nG2 and Menzies Aviation. U.S. airlines are ramping up\ntheir approach to the coronavirus outbreak, cleaning their\ncabins more often and with stronger\nhospital-grade disinfectants. Coronavirus spread rapidly around\nthe globe, killing more than 43,000 people and infecting\nmore than 870,000 as of April 1, 2020, according\nto Johns Hopkins University. According to the CDC, Covid-19,\nis believed to spread mainly when people are in close\ncontact with each other and by respiratory droplets from an\ninfected person who coughs or sneezes. The virus can survive\non a hard surface, such as plastic for up to 72 hours\nand on cardboard for up to 24 hours, according to a\nMarch 2020 study. And according to the CDC,\nnew research indicates that coronavirus RNA, the genetic material\nof the virus that causes Covid-19, was found on\nsurfaces of the Princess Cruise ship up to 17\ndays after passengers disembarked. Vicki Hertzberg is a biostatistician\nand the lead author of a separate study on how\ninfection can spread aboard an airplane. She says the odds of\ncoming into contact with an infected person is relatively\nlow, but transmission increases when an infected person is\nsitting in the row in front of you, the row behind\nyou and the two seats on either side of you. What Hertzberg refers to as\nyour ""perimeter of risk."" Your probability of infection increases\nthe longer you\'re in close proximity with somebody\nwho\'s infectious and the place where that\'s going to make\nthe most difference is if you\'re seated closely to\nthem on an airplane. To keep the air\nclean as it circulates most aircraft used by American,\nDelta and United are equipped with HEPA filters similar\nto the ones used in hospitals that provide a complete air\nchange about 15 to 30 times per hour. This isn\'t to be confused with\nthe mist you sometimes see before takeoff - that\'s condensation\nfog caused by the airplanes air conditioner\nbeing switched on. In response to\nthe pandemic U.S. airlines started using enhanced\ncleaning procedures on planes to combat the\nspread of the virus. Since the advent of coronavirus\nand Covid-19 they\'ve all elevated what they do. Some airlines are using\nfogging systems to disperse sanitizing spray throughout\nthe cabin. They have elevated the intensity\nand strength of the cleaners that they are using. Take Delta. In addition to its normal\ncleaning program Delta Airlines is using high-grade EPA registered\ndisinfectant to wipe down common surface areas in\ngalleys and lavatories. The airline has also added a\nfogging process used in many health care facilities that pushes\nout an EPA registered disinfectant on all\ntrans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic inbound flights. Beginning April 1st, 2020, all\nof Delta\'s domestic flights will undergo the same\nfogging process overnight. And by early May every plane\nin Delta\'s network will be fogged before every flight. American Airlines and United Airlines\nsaid they are also using high-grade disinfectants and\nmultipurpose cleaners on all touch points, including\nwindow shades, armrests and tray tables. Aircraft that remain\novernight at an airport receive an enhanced\ncleaning procedure. United said that because of\nthe coronavirus it will soon start using an electrostatic fogger,\nwhich is essentially a pump sprayer to disinfect the\nair and surfaces within the cabin on all international\narrivals into the U.S. While viruses can live on a\nsurface for hours or days, bacteria can sometimes survive\non surfaces for months. In 2014, Dimer UVC innovations\nlaunched the GermFalcon, a disinfecting machine for airplane\ninteriors that looks like a large food and\ndrink cart with wings. The device is pushed by an\noperator and uses ultraviolet C lamps to eliminate\ngerms and bacteria. The company claims it can kill\n99 percent of germs on a plane in about three minutes. UVC is proven in hospitals to\nbe effective against all known disease causing pathogens, that\'s\nviruses, that\'s bacteria and in hospitals\nits superbugs. On airplanes were primarily\nfocused on viruses like influenza, norovirus, Ebola and\nright now we\'re dealing with coronavirus. According to\nKreitenberg, it can take about 30 to 45 minutes for\nthe GermFalcon to disinfect a wide-body plane for a narrow-body\nplane like a Boeing 737 it can take\nabout three minutes. I\'d say it\'s not\njust about coronavirus. I\'d say coronavirus is the topic\nof the day but every year in America, we deal with the\nflu season and the flu season kills tens of thousands of\nAmericans every single year. Kreitenberg said the company is\nin the early stages of working with the\nairline industry. So far, the device has\ndisinfected some flights arriving from China at LAX Airport in\nearly 2020 and is now working with Paine Field Airport in\nSeattle to disinfect its terminals. While airlines are at the center\nof the coronavirus epidemic, cabin cleaning crews are the\nones on the front lines. In March 2020, more than 600 contracted\nairport workers at Philadelphia\'s airport, including cabin cleaners,\nwere told they were being laid off amid\nthe coronavirus outbreak. In 2018, the most recent year\nthis data was made available there were 12,000 airline cabin cleaners\nin the U.S., a 10 percent increase from 2001,\naccording to Service Employees International Union. Only about a third of cabin\ncleaners work directly for the airlines that year. The median wage for non-airline\ncabin cleaners was $12.56 in 2018, according to SEIU,\nalmost one percent less than the median wage in 2001 -\nand that\'s not accounting for inflation. According to Ken Jacobs,\nthe chair of the UC Berkeley Labor Center, since\nthe early 2000\'s, cabin cleaners have seen a decline\nboth in real wages and benefits. What\'s happened with\nthe outsourcing is that pushes a real race\nto the bottom. Any airline service firm that\nwants to increase pay faces the loss of the\ncontract that they have. That puts downward pressure on\nwages and benefits and leads to high turnover\nfor cabin cleaners. But despite these issues, cabin\ncleaning will be a priority for the airlines in the\nfuture, according to analysts. We\'re going to come out of\nthis coronavirus crisis with an elevated focus on hygiene in\nour homes, in workplaces, where we go to eat and\nfrankly, at airports and on airplanes. Passengers won\'t be as\ntolerant of dirty planes and dirty cabins as they\nwere and importantly, their employees will be as\naccepting of this.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you happen to be working in\nthe travel industry, your entire basis of substance is gone. You can assume its occupancy rates\nhave completely fallen off a cliff. In March of 2017, Airbnb was\nvalued at 31 billion dollars. By the end of April 2020,\nthe value dropped to 18 billion. At the beginning of May, the company\nwas forced to lay off 25 percent of its staff, nearly\n19 hundred individuals. CEO Brian Chesky told employees that\nrevenue this year was forecasted to be less than half of\nwhat the company earned in 2019. They need people to be booking or,\nyou know, they could be in trouble. The company was founded in\n2008 by three friends from college, starting with their own\napartment as the first listing. The concept was simple. Airbnb has hosts and guests. The hosts list their properties on\nAirbnb, the guests book those properties on Airbnb and Airbnb takes\na cut from both sides. They take a percentage of every booking,\nwhich is very similar to how Uber, how Lyft make money. The company grew quickly and today\nhas over seven million listings worldwide. In January 2020, Airbnb saw\n50.2 million Web site visits. Airbnb competition, VRBO saw 14.7 million\nvisits in the same month. Today, Airbnb, by the number of rooms\nthat it has or the number of nights that it books is by\nfar the largest operator in the hospitality industry. No hotel company can\ncompete with the scale. But the global pandemic is proving\nto be Airbnb's greatest challenge yet. The company is struggling\nwith cancellations and reimbursements after Airbnb announced it would\nbe refunding customers whose reservations fell within\na certain timeframe. This angered many hosts who were stuck\nhaving to pay back most, if not all, of the cost of the rental. No one knows what to\ndo in this situation. Many guests were also angered by\nthe way Airbnb handled refund requests. I might just be screwed. Which is completely unfair, and that's\na lot of money, man. That's a that's a lot of money. And while social distancing measures\nwere in place, some local governments deemed short term\nrentals as non-essential businesses, adding more stress to hosts who\nrely on Airbnb for income. Airbnb hosts, if they're going to\ntry and have their business, they're actually gonna be skirting the law. It was speculated that Airbnb would go\npublic in 2020, but that goal is growing more and more distant. Certainly it would be very\ndifficult in this environment. With the threat of more cancellations\nas the pandemic cripples the travel industry, guests, hosts and\ninvestors like are left asking what Airbnb will look like after\nthe Coronavirus pandemic or whether the company will survive at all. Airbnb be defined an entire subgenre\nof the travel industry as it gained popularity, the\nshort term rental It's like Kleenex, you know. Kleenex and Kleenex, it's tissue\nand Airbnbs aren't Airbnbs, they're short term rentals. Airbnb doesn't have a viable competitor,\nat least in the United States and in many other markets. Though it quickly became a market\nleader, it does not have an untarnished record. The platform has been criticized for\ndriving up rent prices and contributing to housing shortages\nin major cities. It has also been criticized\nfor racial discrimination, illegal listings, hosts using spy cams,\ntroublesome, sometimes deadly house parties and unnecessary fees. Despite these conflicts, Airbnb\nwas doing well. According to source says Airbnb actually\nwas profitable in 2017 and 2018. And that's actually seen as a\nlittle bit rare for a unicorn of its size that has this\nmarketplace in the gig economy. In 2019, however, Airbnb burned through\nmore money and is thought to have notched losses. The company was aiming to\ngo public in 2020. We think next year will be\nthe right time for us. Ok. They have very\nstrong market position. Their business was going well. Reservations were going up. Everything was pointing in\nthe right direction. And then of course the sky fell. As Covid-19, spread across the globe,\ntravel ceased and Airbnb lost nearly 42 percent of its value from\nMarch of 2017 to April of 2020. You have to ask, did Airbnb\nwait too long to go public? Many people would say that it did. On March 14th, 2020, Airbnb\nannounced an extenuating circumstances policy that suspended the cancellation\npolicy set by Airbnb hosts. If a guest book to trip on\nor before March 14th with check-in dates between March 14th and April 14th,\nthat guest was allowed to cancel eligible trips without penalty. The policy was extended to allow\nguests with reservations up until May 31st and then again to June\n15th to be eligible for either an Airbnb credit or the more selective\noption, a full cash refund. In any two sided market, you always\nfigured out who you're going to subsidize more and what you're\ngoing to actually screw more. This was a blow for hosts, some\nof whom would lose thousands from the new policy. Cancellations are a detriment\nto the host's bottom line. That's why on Airbnb platform,\nthe hosts choose the cancellation policy they are comfortable with. They made a policy change\nthat overrode every single partners cancellation policies. They made the decision to give guests\nwho fit a specific window, a 100 percent refund, regardless of whether,\nyou know, you as a host had chosen strict,\nmoderate or flexible. This change puts hosts\nin difficult situations. Liam and Travers are two hosts that\nmake a living from their Airbnb listings. I mean, I lost thousands\nupon thousands within like a week. My phone just kept going off. Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel. cancel. I was looking at a\nbusiness that did almost two million dollars in revenue last year and\nwithin two days, I'm like, everything is good. Then all of a\nsudden I'm thinking I might have to go bankrupt. Many hosts rely on\nthe money they make on Airbnb, whether it's just renting out a spare\nroom or if they've built a business with hundreds\nof properties. It's what pays for my mortgage\nand property taxes, and in San Francisco, those two\nthings are lot. Some hosts have shifted their\nbusiness model to compensate. There's multiple ways that\nI can handle this. I can either sit back and blame\nAirbnb for the whole situation or I could kind of take action into my\nown hands and try to pivot my business model so that I can\nmake it through these challenging times, which luckily I did. Travers created a guide for other\nAirbnb hosts discussing ways to save their businesses during this global\npandemic, and Travers, along with many hosts, have turned to longer\nrentals, especially for those in the health care industry to make up\nfor the loss of short term vacation rentals, and Airbnb\nhas supported the strategy. Right now, during Covid, I opened it\nup to a health care worker. A frontline worker\nwas staying there. But Airbnb decision to favor guests\nover hosts has tainted some relationships. They had options. They could have put their listings\non Airbnb, be on VRBO, on Booking.com, built their own websites,\nput them on Craigslist. You know, they had options, but they\nwere going nice and steady and exclusive with Airbnb. And that decision on March 14th just\ncompletely broke the trust for a lot of these hosts. The relationship\nwith Airbnb, it was it was great. I mean, the customers just\nkept on coming, especially in Pittsburgh, where the market's\nnot too saturated. And then with the coronavirus now,\nit's just a new challenge. The CEO, Brian Chesky, faced\nbacklash over the extenuating circumstances policy. Brian Chesky is seen as an\ninnovator, but also somewhat of an operator. He will be truly challenged\nover the next year to navigate Airbnb way through this crisis. He later apologized for making\nthat decision without the host community. I wanted to say\nthis to you right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry we\ndidn't consult you as partners. And I've heard for you\never since that decision. And what I've heard is that, you know,\nyou want us to treat you truly like partners. People\nmake mistakes. He made a mistake. But that doesn't\nmean he isn't on the leadership team, isn't the right team to\nguide Airbnb past this crisis. In response, the company created a\n250 million dollar fund for struggling hosts, but there was some\nfine print on how much hosts would be helped, and many hosts\nwere still left struggling with the cost of cancellations. Airbnb said that, you know, with our\nnew policy, you're going to get 25 percent of what\nyou should have had. So that sounds that you're going to\nget 25 percent of your booking. But really, it's 25 percent of the\n50 percent that you would have had. So a lot of the hosts\nare doing the math, and really, that's just twelve point five percent\nof the original booking. What has happened with the guest,\nhowever, doesn't quite add up either. Though some guests had an\neasy time getting their refunds. Other guests were asked\nto jump through hoops. Eduardo Albani was flying to Rome\nwhere his parents live, and the three of them are going to\nfly to Barcelona after that. When he asked to cancel,\nAirbnb customer service suggested Albani have his elderly parents in\nItaly get a doctor's note. What they would recommend to you is\nthat you send your parents to the doctor, get a certificate\nthey can't travel. I said excuse me. I mean, my parents\nare pretty old, there is a global pandemic. I mean, it's not safe. It's not something you can\nask in this phase. There are I mean, there over 70\nyear old, they're really high risk people. Airbnb Customer Service also\nasked for sensitive information from this guest who\nasked to remain anonymous. My wife, who is a nurse in\na major hospital in Charlotte, used the reason of a medical worker. And then they came back and said,\nwell, if you're a medical worker, we need documentation from your supervisor\nin the hospital saying that you're unable to travel these days\ndue to Covid-19 in your work obligations. That's not what\nthe CEO said. The CEO said it was\nunequivocal, we're giving refund. Done. The hospital had better things\nto do than spend their time writing letters justifying why an\nemployee can't do convenience travel. And we refused to ask\nher employer for that information. Our plan was to do a trip\nto Sayulita, Mexico for spring break with our kids and then another family. You're gonna give a refund to people\nwho had scheduled to go between March 14th and May 31st. I was scheduled between March\n15th and March 22nd. Clearly within there. And yet\nI'm not getting a refund. All of these folks were\ntraveling within the extenuating circumstances, policy timeframe. Luckily, Albani and the anonymous\nguest eventually received refunds. But Scanlon is out eight thousand\neight hundred ninety six dollars because he asked his host to cancel\non March 12th and the policy didn't go into effect\nuntil March 14th. According to Airbnb's extenuating\ncircumstances policy, cancellations will be handled according to\nthe extenuating circumstances coverage in effect at the time of\nsubmission and reservations that were already canceled will\nnot be reconsidered. I have no recourse here. I don't know what to do. My experience of what the requirement was\nto get a full refund was very different than what the CEO\nsaid, his written message, the corporate website. Given the service I've received, I don't\nknow if I will choose it again. Airbnb responded to these\nthree guests complaints, saying our global customer service team has been\nworking around the clock to help both hosts and guests throughout\na situation that has been challenging for the\nentire industry. We firmly believe that travelers should\nnot have to choose between safety and money and are\nextenuating circumstances policy aims to strike a balance and protect the\nwell-being of both hosts and guests. Beyond these three guests, the outcry\nhas been loud against Airbnb's customer service. People are congregating on Twitter. They're congregating on Facebook. They're congregating on Reddit\nto complain about this. I have now like an Airbnb\ncustomers or agent because they're having no luck with the company, and\nnow they're turning to reporters because that's the only\nthing they can do. All this adds up to a pretty\nunstable future for Airbnb, at least for the immediate future. What a day for Airbnb to get\nthrough this is, first of all regain trust of the hosts as\nwell as the guests. I think, you know, one of the worst\nthings that you can deal with is uncertainty. And that's certainly what's\ngoing on right now. I can't imagine that the company\nwill go public in 2020. In early April 2020, Airbnb be\nraised one billion dollars in funding from investors Silverlake and\nSixth Street Partners. But that wasn't enough. The company raised another one billion\ndollars in debt from Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Apollo and\nOaktree just a week later. It is getting hit hard by the global\npandemic and it needs to put more cash on its balance sheet in case\nthis goes on for longer and longer. So it did go to the market twice,\nbut when you look at the types of investors that have gotten into Airbnb,\nthat is a vote of confidence that some of the biggest hedge\nfunds, private equity funds and institutional investors in\nthe world. It's not a bad opportunity for an investor\nto come in and buy up A irbnb's shares in the private market\nfor the cheap, because in the long run, I think it's a solid\ncompany with a solid business model, but they need more capital. I don't think, you know, two billion\ndollars is gonna go too far, by the way. But that still wasn't enough\nmoney and Airbnb had to make massive cuts to its workforce. Airbnb has also enacted a hiring\nfreeze, cut executive salaries by 50 percent and may\nscrap employee bonuses. The CEO won't even get a\nsalary for the next six months. In better news for the company, some\nsay Airbnb is in a better position than other businesses in\nthe travel industry, especially hotels. Because a hotel company\nstill has to pay rent. They still have to pay\nthe real estate taxes. They still have to pay the labor. They have to keep the\nfacilities maintained and cleaned. While it's unlikely the company will\nclose its doors for good once this is all over, it may end\nup being a very different company when folks do start traveling again. I do believe they will come\nthrough this actually much more strongly than the hospitality\nindustry in general. Probably Airbnb doesn't know if they're\ngonna get through this because we don't know how long this pandemic\nis going to last and we don't know how long it's going to\ntake before people feel comfortable to travel again and stay in other people's\nhomes or even book a hotel room. The type of fall that we might\nsee can be more in line with that of Uber and we work. There is still around, but there are\nshell of what they once were.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,0,Can Major U.S. Airlines Survive The Coronavirus Outbreak?,"The golden age for airlines could be ending thanks to the spike in worldwide cases of COVID-19. A drop in crude prices would normally be a positive for airlines. However, border closings, event cancellations, and the potential for travelers to end up quarantined could cause a cascade of failures throughout the aviation industry.

We've seen a dramatic drop\nin demand that really the industry hasn't seen since 9/11. The next few months will be ugly for\nthe travel industry in terms of both demand and their\nfinancial performance. The initial coronavirus outbreak caused a\nmassive drop in air travel inside of China between\nJanuary and February. As the virus has spread, both\nvacationers and business travelers have curb ed their plans. And on March\n11th, 2020, President Trump announced that travel from parts of\nEurope to the U.S. would be halted for 30 days, which\nlater expanded to include Ireland and the UK. Airlines around the world scrambled\nto find a way to survive without passengers. There have been discussions about whether\nto tell people not to fly. It's the worst crisis to hit the\nair travel industry since the 9/11 terror attacks. Delta Airlines has cut\nits capacity by 70 percent. United Airlines has cut 65 percent\nof its capacity and American Airlines has cut 50 percent of its capacity. When an airline says they're going\nto cut capacity, that means they're going to cancel some flights. And that could be canceling frequencies in\na route that has lots of frequencies in it. Or it could\nmean stopping flying between two cities they've been flying before. Airlines talk about capacity as the number\nof seats they have in the air at any time or really the number of\nseats they have out for sale at any time. Internationally Norwegian, SAS and\nLufthansa have suspended most of their operations and more cutbacks\nare expected from other airlines. That demand picture is\nworse than after 9/11. And we have no visibility as to\nwhen things are going to recover. On the range of possibility, sure, there\nis a scenario where a couple of months from now, maybe coronavirus isn't\neradicated, but things are more stable and health authorities are changing\ntheir advice that people are willing to get back on airplanes. But you know that at this point\nis the most optimistic estimate scenario, months of disruption. The U.S. Senate just reached a deal\non a massive two trillion dollar relief package to help with industries and\nindividuals hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The airlines wanted $50 billion\nfrom the package, and the exact details on what ended up\nin the deal remained vague. What we do know now, is that airlines\nwon't be able to buy back stock or handout bonuses to CEOs as part of the\ndeal, and they won't need to pay back the direct cash\ngrants they receive. Though the government will\ntake an equity share. The airlines must also agree to refrain\nfrom layoffs until later in 2020. Airlines run on tough margins in regional\nstart ups go under every year. It is easy to see why\nthe Covid 19 outbreak concerns airlines. In 2019 alone, twenty three airlines\nclosed shop, including WoW Airlines and Thomas Cook. And that's\nbefore the coronavirus pandemic. And in 2020, Alaska Airlines said it\nhas seen two hundred sixty five thousand fewer bookings for\nMarch than in 2019. The impact airline travel in\nChina was rapid and vast. Flights dropped by more than 80\npercent, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The onset\nof quarantines inside China starting and move on grounded\nhundreds of airliners. In 2016, 20 million travelers\nuse the Wuhan International Airport. And Beijing, where an eleven point four\nbillion dollar state of the art airport was just opened, ranks as the\nsecond busiest city for air travel in the world. Even in areas\nnot quarantined by the Chinese government. Citizens were reluctant to travel. Disease spreads when people are stuck\nin close proximity to each other, something airlines are infamous for. As the Covid 19 outbreak spread\nin the United States, planes began traveling with near empty cabins\nas passengers canceled their flights. People were told to limit their\nactivities and embrace social distancing. That's not so easy at 30000 feet. Administration officials even recommended that\nthose at the highest risk, such as the elderly or those with\nunderlying health problems, not fly at all. All those flights being grounded has\na ripple effect on the industry. The challenge for everybody is nobody knows\nwhen this virus is going to be addressed, when it will start to\nabate, when people will feel more confident about flying, and importantly,\nwhen business travelers will return to the skies. This isn't the first major disruption\nthe airline industry has faced after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Aircraft were grounded throughout the United\nStates and no flights were allowed in or out of the country. Besides the immediate concern over\nstranded passengers, airlines took a massive financial hit. It took a $15 billion bailout from\nCongress to keep major airlines afloat. Another recent disaster for the airline\nindustry was the eruption of the Island Mountain Glacier volcano in\nIceland when the volcano erupted. A massive plume of ash was released\ninto the atmosphere, making the most efficient air routes between\nEurope and America unusable. The incident cascaded and slowed down\nglobal routes as aircraft and passengers were stranded or redirected\nto much longer routes. The 2008 recession also caused a slowdown\nin air travel, one of the industry's most lucrative clientele, business\ntravelers dropped to all time lows. During 2008, the U.S. airline industry lost just more\nthan five billion dollars. To put it into context, after 9/11, in\n2002, the industry had a big, lost one and a half percent. In other words, air travel was\ndown one and a half percent. That was pretty tough. The Great Recession. We\nlost about 1 percent. This year, we could lose 10. Airlines are more than just a way to get\nfrom point A to point B, they are a point of national pride. In previous economic slowdowns, governments\naround the world have stepped in to prevent national\ncarriers from going under. The last time the government\nrescued airlines following 9/11, the government actually made\nmoney on that. It basically got to get a stake in\nthese airlines and sold its stake years later at about a 300 million dollar\nprofit similar to the auto maker bailout. Besides getting bailouts and\neconomic stimulus, airlines also take their own actions\nto survive sudden downturns. They cut routes such as daily shuttle\nflights between cities and also long haul flights with\nhigh overhead costs. When you're in trouble, the first order\nof business is fly the airplane. Make sure you know how much fuel you\nhave, where you are, where are you going, that your wings\nare straight and level. And that's kind of where\nthe industry is right now. Okay. Where are we? What do we need to do? And what\nthat means is they need to preserve cash, as much cash as they can, which\nmeans they're canceling flights that would likely lose cash, but continuing to\nfly flights that are generating cash. Some airlines have already grounded large\nportions of their aircraft and laid off staff in hopes of\nresuming operations after the pandemic has subsided. Airports and all the workers who\nmake the day to day operations runs will also be\naffected by the slowdown. And aircraft manufacturers like Boeing\nare looking for federal help. Boeing was fortunate to be able to\nget through one major crisis that might have killed a lot of other customers. That, of course, the grounding\nof the Boeing max. Who's too big to fail? The candidates for that, a wider swath\nof the economy than it would have previously been. But the arguments Boeing\nwould make is, look, Boeing is America's biggest exporter. There's no other company that exports more\nto the world than Boeing does. It employs, of course,\na lot of people. And yeah, it's a producer of goods\nthat are key to national security. No question about that. Again, a lot of other\npeople certainly be in line. A lot of other people,\nCompanies, for government aid. The potential bailout is already facing\nsome serious push back from lawmakers. United Airlines just announcing that\nthey will lose money in the first quarter, not make money. And Boeing is suspending its operations,\nproduction operations up in the Puget Sound area. In normal pre-pandemic\ntimes, Boeing might have been a sure thing for a government bailout,\nbut there are several other industries and sectors lining up for\ngovernment assistance because of the coronavirus. The financial outlook for\nairlines just took a nosedive. And while the pandemic ranks as\nthe biggest disruption in aviation history, it perhaps hit at\nan advantageous time for carriers. 9/11 happened on a Tuesday. By that Saturday. U.S. airlines were laying off tens\nof thousands employees of employees over continental labor. Part of United, what, first, 12000\nlayoffs, 20 percent of its workforce. And within a few weeks, 75000 U.S. airline jobs were gone this time. Weeks into the crisis, U.S. airlines, the major ones, anyway, still\nhadn't laid off their their first person. Even though the capacity cuts this\ntime have been far greater, the golden age of air travel has\nleft airlines with full coffers, especially American based companies. The liquid assets of the major airlines\nand most of the regional players are in good shape. And unlike\nafter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there probably won't be a need for\nmassive reorganizations of the major airlines. I don't think of it\nexactly like 9/11, however, because after 9/11, the industry was forced to\nrestructure in some really dramatic ways. Several airlines went\ninto bankruptcy protection. Airlines closed hubs that didn't\nmake much sense after 9/11. There were big changes for\ncustomers in terms of security. And on the airplane, the door to\nthe cockpit and the procedures on the airplane. I don't see those kinds of\nchanges coming with this, at least not yet. Mechanics, suppliers and pilots\nfor the most part aren't getting laid off in mass as of yet. And those that are hopefully\nonly being laid off temporarily. It is expected that there will be\na need for them shortly after the pandemic subsides. The problem with the pandemic is that\nno one really knows how long this could go on. For U.S. airlines, look if you could assure\nthem that this is going to be a two or a three month issue, I don't\neven know that they would be wanting government aid and taking some of\nthe strings attached to that. Most of these U.S. airlines would be\npositioned to get through a months long disruption. The problem is they just\ndon't know how long it's going to go on and to keep employing\npeople, paying people basically to stay home indefinitely. They would quickly run out of money. That's a key difference between\nthis crisis and 9/11. Airlines are well positioned in the\nshort term compared to previous downturns. However, the requests for\nstimulus from the government indicates the industry is worried about\nhow long this will last. Airlines thought they were\nprepared for anything. And it turns out they were\nprepared for anything except this.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

feeling the effects of an economic shutdown there's no doubt that the issues around the coronavirus are having a significant impact the Dow index has now lost 3200 points this week alone it is now down nearly 10 percent this year one of its biggest victims is Hollywood the center of America's entertainment industry the US government's call for social distancing has forced all studios to shut down their TV and film production as well as postpone all of their theatrical releases resulting in hundreds of thousands of workers in the industry losing their jobs in the process I myself am on hold for a job in May very big Network job and I keep thinking it's just not gonna happen we have seen a halt in production the past due to strikes and other things but this is quite different this is a halting production that no one could have anticipated no one saw coming really it couldn't plan for it this is huge news considering Hollywood is one of the key players in the American economy a 101 billion dollar industry that supports two and a half million jobs and contributes to 181 billion dollars in total wages so the industry of creating visual entertainment is an industry that is spread out over a large area from the caterers the people that provide food for the workers and for the large amounts of workers that create the shows all the way to the streamers and to the industry that is based around exhibiting the product that we create it's one of America's largest exports as one of the world's oldest film industries Hollywood has had its fair share of experience with recessions but nothing quite like kovin 19 which poses an essential question can the movie industry survive the corona virus and if so what would it look like after the American market has always held a long-standing belief that movies are a recession proof industry and so if you think about why we would think of Hollywood as being recession proof it's because what's happening in a recession is what we think of in economic terms as substitution people will substitute from more expensive goods to cheaper goods so in entertainment terms you can substitute from a live show which is expensive to movie which is much cheaper it's also because of how well Hollywood fared during the Great Depression movie attendance remained high at 60 to 80 million attendees per year people couldn't afford bread yet they were going to the movie theaters almost around the clock but things have changed since then during the Great Recession of 2008 the industry took a major hit despite a relatively stable performance in the box office hiring rates in the art entertainment and recreation sector dropped by 16% with nearly 900,000 employees laid off or discharged in 2008 alone and companies that own major film studios like disney viacom and Time Warner nearly halved in share prices during its were strong but Cova 19 poses an entirely different challenge as recent measures for social distancing closed down theaters physically preventing people from going to the movies the challenge with kovat 19 is it's unlike any recession we've ever had before we don't know if people are gonna want to return the theaters we don't know how how frequently they're gonna want to go or if they're gonna want to go at all for the first time in history studios are looking at near zero box-office revenue for the foreseeable future domestic box office for the third week of March brought in a mere 5,000 $179 a hundred percent decrease from the previous week it's a devastating hit considering 42 percent of global theatrical and home mobile entertainment market still depends on theatrical releases people are willing to pay more to watch a movie in a theater than on any other platform and so if these films can't be shown in theaters that is just gonna be economically disastrous for the studios and as the National Association of theater owners requested relief measures from the government and now what we need Congress to do is to step in and to help industries like ours that are completely shut down shares of theater chains like AMC and Cinemark plummeted over 50% certainly with the rise of streaming we've seen a decline of theatrical tickets and so the theater business has been on shaky ground before the virus and this will only amplify that the series of bad news from Hollywood and the unprecedented 6.6 million unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department have sent the entertainment sector spiraling media groups that own subsidiaries in movie production and distribution like Comcast Sony and Viacom have sunk with the rest of the market the problem worsens once you look outside of the US theaters around the world are shutting down and that is bad news for the film industry that heavily benefits from international ticket sales studios are now looking at alternative release strategies on April 10th universals trolls world tour became its first film to release digitally and theatrically at the same time the determining factor on whether a film would be released on home video rather than in a theater is based a lot on the budget because again if you don't have the theatrical dollars coming and mean the movie theater revenue it'd be really hard to make a lot of those bigger movies profitable most if not all of the big-budget summer blockbusters like MGM's no time to die and Warner Brothers Wonder Woman 1984 have been postponed to a later date some films like universals fast 9 are even being delayed for an entire year whether it'll be profitable is another question and that's why these movies have to be theatrically released because that's the only way is from those tickets sold in movie theaters that you can pay back first the production budget then pay for the marketing budget and then at that point eke out a profit however streaming is one part of the media in the street that is rapidly growing recent nielsen data shows that an average person spent 36% more minutes streaming during the week of March 16th as compared to the week of February 24th before the shutdown Netflix and YouTube are the two most popular choices it's gonna accelerate the the introduction the adoption of streaming and our homes and then it'll be interesting to see what the long-term effects are do do the theaters come back or do we all decide that you know what sing in my home watching this in the safety and comfort of my home is so much easier the pandemic is not only devastating to the big studios but the people who work in the industry as well Hollywood has long been known for its freelance economy that hires freelancers of various backgrounds and expertise we're constantly hustling we hustle in order to work in this industry you hostile and and if you're really lucky you get on a regular show that runs for a while and then it ends and then you're that's it right on the phone emailing but hundreds of thousands of them have lost their jobs overnight as productions are postponed or canceled due to the virus I had quite a few things lined up to shoot and all of a sudden one right after another the phone started ringing and I was watching the news so I knew inevitably that was what was coming and boy just like dominoes one right after another everything many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck and rely on overtime or secondary jobs to stay afloat a bigger issue lies in the fact that many of them don't qualify for traditional unemployment benefits due to their employment status and the nature of their job the gig economy is a very fragile economy and I think this virus is exposing that fragility I think a lot of our problems economically extend beyond before this virus are being revealed now and part of that is the fact that we have a large amount of people who are self-employed the Writers Guild of America strike in 2007 might give a glimpse into how devastating the situation could turn out to be the strike forced many major productions to shut down over 100 days costing 37,000 700 jobs and 2.1 billion dollars in just three months this whole situation just caused so much angst and stress for people in the industry and again for all industries and I don't know we couldn't have seen this coming but I guess it is somewhat analogous to a like a writer's strike or something like that but that's totally different because that was something planned and this is something completely unimaginable even six months ago a few companies have stepped in to provide relief for the industry the streaming service Netflix are now setting up a 100 million dollar Relief Fund for its out-of-work production crews and cast members thank God our union is also continuing they fought to continue our health care for the next six to nine months so that normally we have to qualify with certain amount of our verse but they're kind of they're waiving that right now so that's no one will get kicked off medical which is great but most hope lies on the unprecedented two billion dollar stimulus bill signed into law on March 27th although the stimulus package does not directly address Hollywood as it did with medical and airline industries it provides some measures for studios and freelancers to stay afloat the new bill allows for more freelancers and part-time workers to be eligible to apply for unemployment benefits with an additional $600 per week for four months compared to other beneficiaries bigger studios can take advantage of the 500 billion dollar lending program while smaller businesses with less than 500 employees can rely on a 350 billion dollar lending program as long as they do not lay off its workers as to how much it will help the industry is somewhat of a mixed bag nobody thinks that this $1200 is going to solve the biggest problems of the cash flow of being stopped from our employers especially if we're talking about an extended period of time anytime you are injecting two trillion dollars into the economy that is far better than not injecting two trillion dollars into the economy so the stimulus bill will have a positive impact on the entertainment business it might just happen in the long run but maybe not in the short run I think it's great for right now but how long is that $1,200 musta last not in LA that's that doesn't last very long at all but no matter how bleak and uncertain the future might be one thing is for certain people will always want some sort of entertainment entertainment for so many of us is the the thing that keeps us going and gives us that escape from these troubles that are happening right now in our world""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,0,Why Airbus And Boeing Dominate The Sky,"Airbus and Boeing dominate an already under competitive airline manufacturing industry.  The duopoly owns the sky by making up 99% of global large aircraft orders and those large plane orders make up more than 90% of the total plane market according to the Teal Group, an aerospace market analysis company (regional jet manufacturers only account for 7% of the airplane market by value).The duopoly doesn’t have many competitors, but overseas competition is brewing. China’s state-run company, COMAC, is poised to make waves in the aviation manufacturing industry, but some say not for a couple decades.

The Airbus-Boeing duopoly dominates the already under competitive aircraft manufacturing industry by producing more than 99% of its large airplane orders globally. It\'s become one of the most efficient duopolies ever in the history of manufacturing Are smaller competitors finally giving them a run for their money? Or are they just getting scooped up? Will China step into the market and make waves? What about the future of flying? Will Supersonic planes challenge Airbus and Boeing\'s dominance? Before we answer those questions let\'s start with how we got to a place where just two companies own the air Boeing has always been a big player in the aviation field for over 100 years. The Boeing Company was created in 1916. William Boeing founded the Aero Products Company and developed a single engine seaplane and the business was renamed the Boeing Company and sold its planes to the Navy during the First World War Boeing continued to sell its aircraft during the 1920s and 1930s to the U.S. military. During this time Boeing also expanded into airmail services. In 1919 Eddie Hubbard and I took a flight up to Vancouver B.C. This was the first ever international mail ever carried by planes into the United States. The Boeing Airplane and Transportation Corporation was formed and it covered both the manufacturing and airline operations but the Air Mail Act of 1934 split aircraft manufacturers from air transport. So the conglomerate of the day was dissolved in the company went back to being called ""Boeing."" With the development of turbo jets, the Boeing 707 was introduced to the public in 1958 on Pan American\'s trans Atlantic route and the public loved it With smoother rides and a shorter flight time Boeing paved the way for the future of commercial flight. Boeing may encapsulate Americana via the golden age of flying but the much younger Airbus had a rough road to success. It started as a group effort in Europe to take on American manufacturers. In 1967 Germany, France, and Britain came to the agreement that a cooperation of aviation field would promote technology and economic growth in Europe. They drew up plans for a short haul European Airbus that would accommodate the public\'s desire to fly more for less. Plans were made to construct the A300. In October of 1972 the A300 completed its first flight. But Airbus leaders had an uphill battle ahead of them convincing the world they created the most innovative aircraft. By 1984 Airbus received 411 orders and had 282 aircraft in active service. The persistence paid off the long run because in 2018 Airbus delivered 800 planes. 11% growth from the year before. And Boeing\'s business is thriving as well. In 2018 the company set the record for the most airplane deliveries with 806 commercial jets, 5.6% growth from 2017. And the stocks have reflected the company\'s dominance. Both Airbus and Boeing stocks have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. How can you tell these planes apart? Boeing and Airbus have subtle differences. For instance the cockpit of a Boeing 737 has a yoke control whereas an Airbus A320 does not. That\'s just one of the many ways these companies diverge in their manufacturing. Most are only felt by the crew and travelers with a keen eye. How do airlines decide which company to buy from? Think of it like going to a car dealership and choosing between a Chevy and a Ford. Both are supposed to get you to your destination but which one has a better deal? And what does the existing fleet look like? For example, Spirit and Frontier operate only Airbus, while Southwest is an all Boeing fleet. It\'s hard for low cost operations like these to switch. The legacy airlines usually have a mix of both. So what does it take for companies like Airbus and Boeing to control the airline industry? Well, building these airplanes isn\'t cheap. To be a real competitor aviation companies must have the money to spend. The barriers to entry in this business are huge in terms of capital requirements, in terms of technology experience, customer support, customer finance, all of these things. A single plane can run up millions of dollars in construction fees. Boeing is currently working on a new series of airplanes called the 777X. A single 777-9 has a list price of $388.7 million dollars. That\'s because there are hundreds of thousands of components to an airplane. A Boeing 747 alone is made up of six million parts. But materials aren\'t the only thing that costs aviation companies big. Safety comes with a hefty price tag. It\'s definitely a well-regulated industry. I don\'t think there\'s any question about that. I actually view much, not all, but I view much of that regulation has a historical partnership that has actually served the industry quite well. If you consider that the airlines today aviation globally carries three billion passengers a year and most years kill fewer than 500 of them. Some years none. That\'s a pretty extraordinary record. And reaching that level of safety requires a great expense And these massive companies have plenty of money And at least for Boeing a lot of it comes from the government. It was the second largest government contractor in 2017 behind only Lockheed Martin bringing in more than 23 billion dollars. It also spends big to keep its close relationship with Washington. The company spent more on lobbying than any other company in the United States other than General Electric from 1998 to 2018 according to Open Secrets 270 million dollars. The acting Secretary of Defense at the beginning of 2019 is a former Boeing executive that led the 787 Dreamliner program. And the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration or the FAA used to work for an airline manufacturing industry group Responding to a question about its lobbying power. Boeing told CNBC this ""as the nation\'s largest exporter and a leading producer of both commercial and defense aerospace products, there are a number of significant policy issues at the federal state and local levels with the potential to impact our business our diverse workforce and our supply chain. Our team is focused on telling Boeing""s story and supporting policies that advance the aviation industry and U.S. manufacturing in the communities where we live and work."" The company\'s entrenched position has a real world impact. When Delta ordered planes from the Canadian company Bombardier in 2016, the company fought hard arguing the smaller competitor could only sell them at such a low price to the Canadian subsidies. The Trump administration originally sided with Boeing putting tariffs on the planes but Boeing ended up losing the battle when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in Bombardier\'s is favor at the beginning of 2018. The battle showed how hard it has become for smaller companies to break into the market. Which brings us exactly to that where is the competition? Airbus and Boeing may command domestic and international airspace but for regional flights the Canadian company Bombardier and the Brazilian company Embraer control the market or at least they used to. The overhead for the aviation manufacturing business can be crushing and regional aircraft manufacturers like Bombardier a couldn\'t shoulder the costs. Bombardier of Canada had the The best hope of getting in they simply ran out of cash. And this year their jetliner was basically absorbed by Airbus. Now the Airbus A220 rather than the Bombardier C-Series. In 2017 Airbus announced it would acquire a majority stake in Bombardier\'s C-Series. Airbus rebranded the series as a new a 220 and sold 120 former C-Series jets to U.S. airline companies in 2018. Airbus will begin building the aircraft later this month. And let\'s not forget about Brazilian aircraft company Embraer the other regional jet manufacturer. Boeing just bought 80% of Embraer commercial aviation business for a whopping $4.2 billion dollars. The Brazilian government approved the deal in January and both companies announced that they expect to get all the remaining approvals before 2020. The reality was that these smaller companies weren\'t really competing anyway. In 2016 regional aircraft deliveries were less than 7% of the airplane market by value. Other countries like Russia and China have also been trying to become prominent players in the aircraft manufacturing industry. But so far both countries have been unable to make a dent in the private sector. They could flip a switch and they\'d be great at it. The frustrating thing about China is that the only possible thing they could do wrong is exactly what they\'re doing. They\'ve got the biggest market in the world. They\'ve got limited talent on limited resources. They should be great in this. But the strategy they\'re pursuing is basically digging a giant hole. They\'re running it as a government operation and very simply government owned industries to not do a good job beating commercial market needs. Next thing they\'re doing is rather than saying to their engineers, ""hey you can go shopping for the best components and technology around the globe..."" They\'re saying you have to buy stuff made in China and that means only stuff that involves Western companies coming to China and surrendering their intellectual property. Boeing and Airbus aren\'t shying away from potential competition. Boeing highlighted its partnership with COMAC on a completion of a facility in Zhoushan. The company also told us, ""China\'s commercial aviation sector represents a major customer an important partner in a potent competitor. China is on track to become the largest commercial airplane market in the world over the next few years. Getting the right balance between collaborating and competing requires work in constant evaluation."" When we asked Airbus about Chinese competition they told CNBC this ""the Boeing Airbus to Oxley isn\'t likely to last forever. In general we see China as the next major competitor though in some 10 to 20 years from now. The Chinese market is large enough for more than two competitors in every market we welcome competition. Airbus was born competition, thrives in it, and believes it is good for the development of our industry. So what\'s next for the aviation industry? Will it be the return of supersonic travel? The aptly named Colorado-based company Boom Supersonic announced it has received millions in funding from investors. Boom is looking to make supersonic travel mainstream. Marketing their aircraft is being able to get passengers to and from their destinations two times faster than business class flights today. Commercial supersonic travel isn\'t new. In 1976 the first Concorde flights took off from London and just outside Paris. But the Concorde days were short lived. Noise pollution, mounting expenses, combined with a fatal air crash caused the Concorde to be retired in 2003. But there are many barriers sitting in the way of creating supersonic commercial travel. The first being it\'s illegal. They would have to demonstrate that these are usable over land. At present it\'s not legal to operate supersonically over landmasses at least in the U.S. NASA been testing so called ""quiet boom"" aircraft in fact they\'re testing them right now in the Gulf of Mexico, the people of Galveston Texas are the dummies I guess to see whether they notice the booms. It remains to be seen whether those theoretical designs can be put into practice. But the big question is can supersonic travel be economically feasible? Will they be willing to pay five times as much for the aircraft and their operating costs in order to go twice as fast because the fuel bill basically piles up. We\'re now flying slower than we did in 1970s and 80s but on the other hand there\'s this economic reason for that. It\'s not just civilian companies developing supersonic travel. Lockheed Martin announced plans to build supersonic aircraft that could change commercial travel. Lockheed Martin is partnering with NASA to develop the X59 QueSST. This aircraft is designed to have a cruising altitude of 55,000 feet and a terminal speed of 940 miles per hour. And forget that super alarming sonic boom. According to the Lockheed Martin Skunkworks team the plane would create a sound no louder than the slamming of a car door. But the development is still in its beta stages. As for Boeing and Airbus both companies told us supersonic and hypersonic travel is on their radars and that they are committed to pursuing multiple innovative technologies moving forward. The future of the aviation manufacturing business remains unclear. But one thing is clear the multi-billion dollar industry will continue to grow as millions of more people around the world enter the middle class. The International Air Transport Association expects the number of air travelers to double to 8.2 billion by 2037 and Airbus and Boeing are poised to take a vantage of those soaring trends.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What makes the pandemic particularly frightening\nfor many is the lack of an approved vaccine or\ntreatment of the virus. So there is no\napproved therapy for COVID-19. So physicians in the hospital\nare generally treating symptoms, providing supportive care. That fluids and oxygen and\nrenal replacement therapy is needed. Really trying to keep the patient alive\nso the patient has a chance to recover on their own. One glimmer\nof hope could be the recent discovery of a\npossible treatment Remdesivir. Manufactured by Gilead sciences. Data shows that Remdesivir, has\nit clear cut significant positive effect in diminishing the\ntime to recovery. Developing a treatment for COVID-19 is\nimportant to help patients that are critically ill who need either\nsome sort of reduction in side effects, prevent viral entry into the\ncells, or in other words, you know, prevent the\ndisease from progressing. Knowing how to treat COVID-19 could be\na valuable asset in a turning point in the fight\nagainst the pandemic. So how close are we\nto developing a treatment? And why would economic\nrecovery depend on it? There are several ways to fight a\npandemic, but a vaccine that can help build up immunity against COVID-19\nstill remains the long term solution. The vaccine is\nreally the holy grail. It's the thing that really opens\nup the possibilities of returning to a normal way of life. The problem is it's going to take\nsome time to be approved for mass use, about 12 to 18\nmonths, according to most experts. Yet some reports predict that close\nto half of the global population will eventually contract the virus\nwhile aggressive testing to contain the spread of the disease\nstill remains a top priority, s cientists and researchers believe that\nan effective treatment can serve as a bridge to a vaccine\nthat will hopefully arrive in the near future. Developing a treatment for\nCOVID disease is important because we know that without treatment,\nthere's a high morbidity and mortality rate. Governments and industries\nacross the world are combining their efforts in\ndeveloping a treatment. U.S. health agencies like the\nNational Institutes of Health have partnered up with a dozen\nleading pharmaceutical companies for a faster collaboration, while more than\n70 countries have joined the WHO to accelerate\nthe research process. Although President Trump\ncontroversially suspended American contributions to the organization. They're pooling all of the data that\nwe have about the safety and efficacy of treatments and making\nthat available to companies to speed development even faster\nthan its normal. There are hundreds of treatment\noptions currently under consideration. On March 24th, the FDA approved\nthe use of convalescent plasma therapy that uses the blood of\nrecovered patients to treat those in critical condition. The Mayo Clinic is\ncurrently the leading site for evaluating the efficacy\nof the therapy. There's been a lot of news coverage\nabout the plasma therapy, and I think it's because it\nshould be widely accessible. It's cheap. And the trials\nare ongoing right now. It's a treatment that's actually been\naround for over 100 years to combat other diseases like the\nSpanish flu pandemic of 1918. So the theory underlying treating\nsomebody with COVID disease with plasma is that a patient who\nhas previously recovered COVID should have antibodies and those antibodies\nshould target the virus and hopefully will neutralize that virus\nso that the virus stops replicating. If proven to be effective,\nplasma therapies can also be used to protect healthcare workers who\nare treating patients on the frontlines. Further testing is still needed\nto prove its efficacy and safety before it can be\nroutinely administered to patients. Right now, we don't know how\neffective it's going to be. And so it's important to do\nthese treatments under control study circumstances so that we can study,\ndo patients who have recovered from the virus have antibodies? Do they neutralize? And do they help make\npeople better as a consequence. If proved, the challenge also lies\nin securing enough plasma to treat those who are in need, a constraint\nmade even more difficult by FDA's restriction on donations from\ngay and bisexual men. The biggest challenge right now\nis identifying donors and having donors work through the system in a\nmanner that allows them to donate plasma efficiently. The systems are being developed as\na new treatment where we're a therapy or so, and so\nthere's been some growing pains. But there is now a national\neffort to coordinate the blood donation activities. Convalescent plasma therapy is\njust one of many therapeutic treatments currently\nunder consideration. As of April 19th, the FDA\nrevealed that there are 72 treatments currently going under trial, with\nan additional 211 alternative treatments in their\nplanning stages. Yes, there's a lot of therapies\nand what individual institutions are doing and Mayo is one of\nthem, is evaluating those therapies. Which ones can we access? Which ones do we think have\nthe most favorable benefit to to potential side effect ratio and trying\nto decide which trials we want to start here. Another possible\ntreatment option that regulators are heavily leaning towards is\nrepurposing existing medications. It is very common to use\nrecycled drugs to treat new diseases. In many cases, we don't have effective\ntherapy, so we use what we have. Repurposed medications have two\nunique advantages over working on a treatment from\nscratch, time and supply. They're already available and approved for\na different disease in most markets in the world. So in a\nperfect world, the fastest way for us to get a treatment is to use\nan existing drug and find out through clinical trials that it works\nin COVID-19 as well. Drugs that are normally used to\ntreat other conditions like HIV, malaria, Ebola and rheumatoid arthritis\nare currently under trial as possible candidates to\ntreat COVID-19. Kevzara a rheumatoid arthritis drug made\nby Regeneron and Sanofi show promising results for the\nsickest of coronavirus patients. The immune response that you see\nin rheumatoid arthritis may be very similar to the immune response\nthat you see in COVID-19. So you're trying to apply the\nsame concept to a different disease. There's still an immune response. Immune response is our\nimmune responses within body. And so you're trying to affect\nthat immune response with a similar mechanism. Even if they are proven safe\nfor human consumption, repurposed drugs must still go through rigorous\nadditional trials to ensure their safety and efficacy\nagainst COVID-19. It takes a lot of trial and error\nin many cases to come up with the either treatment or preventive vaccine that\nis going to be used in the public. And a lot of these\nreally hinge on not only is it effective, but is it safe? You can give something to a patient\nthat will stop or treat the disease or prevent it from\ngoing to another person. However, it could be at such a high\nlevel that it is toxic to that patient. Hydroxychloroquine is a recent\nexample of the importance of rigorous clinical trials. The anti-malaria drug is available in\na generic form, and is also produced under the brand name\nPlaquenil by French pharmaceutical company Sanofi. The malaria drug was once touted by\nPresident Trump as a game changer in the fight against COVID-19 After\nshowing promising results in a small scale study in France. I think it could be a game\nchanger and maybe not and maybe not. But I think it could be based on\nwhat I see, it could be a game changer. However, a recent nationwide\nstudy revealed it might result in more deaths without any\nreal benefits, prompting the National Institutes of Health as well as the\nFDA to warn against its use due to the risk regarding its toxicity. There is a lot of confusion\nabout what really is evidence for effectiveness and safety. A lot of things that we see\nare anecdotal use of drugs like hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in patients\nwho have been sick. It's very difficult, statistically speaking,\nto point out whether or not this is actually effective or\nthe patient just coincidentally got better, which happens Frankly treatment development is\nvery, very difficult business. Four out of five\ndrugs fail in development. And that exact same failure rate\nshould be expected in developing a treatment for COVID-19. On April 24th, White\nHouse health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci revealed promising\nresults from Gilead Sciences remdesivir. And it is a very\nimportant proof of concept because what it is proven is that a\ndrug can block this virus. Sparking hope for the development\nof an effective treatment against COVID-19. I think because there's\nso much research into experimental therapies for COVID and there's so\nmany good drug candidates out there. I think it is likely that\nwe will be able to identify a therapy that has some success within\na period of several months to maybe a year. Fortunately, the development\nof a treatment for a novel disease like COVID-19, is likely to\nbe faster than ever thanks to recent rapid advancements\nin technology. You are seeing now an explosion of\ntechnology and new and new startup companies who are becoming adept at\npooling massive amounts of data to inform how to best target a new\ndrug in a novel in a novel target for a particular disease. So AI and ML is becoming a\nreal hot spot through a technology lens for drug discovery, Microsoft recently announced, the launch of\nchat bots known as plasma bots that can help recruit recover\npatients to donate their blood for plasma therapies. While IBM has partnered up with the\nWhite House to launch the COVID-19 High Performance\nComputing Consortium. That will make supercomputing power,\navailable for researchers and scientists working on\ndeveloping a treatment. We have these unique scientific\ninstruments which are supercomputers that have been designed historically\nto accelerate the rate of discovery, to be able to\nperform calculations and simulations that would be costly\nto do experimentally. Next generation supercomputers like IBM's\nSummit, the world's fastest supercomputer, or helping researchers study\nthe virus and narrow down which drugs can be effective\nagainst it using complex simulations. Let's say we want to\nmodel the virus itself. We can represent the structure of the\nvirus and we can use these computers to model its\nbehavior and its interactions. Now, that process of doing\nall those experiments is normally something that would take many, many, many\nmonths if you were to do it on a normal computer. But you could do it under\ntwo days because you're using a supercomputer. Computing power that was\nonce thought to be impossible could entirely change how we\nrespond to future pandemics. Right now we are learning and creating\nnew ways to collaborate on new institutions and new ways to mobilize\nthe tech sector to respond to the current crisis. Out of this\nwe will definitely not only have lessons learned, but we will\ncreate new mechanisms for coordination to better prepare\nfor future crises. On March 31st, first the\nFDA announced its Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program designed to help\naccelerate the approval process for any potential\ntreatments for COVID-19. I am aware of individual protocols\nthat had been approved within twelve hours. I'm aware of many\nprotocols that have been approved within 24 hours. So the red tape\nhas absolutely been cut. I don't believe this has been done\nat the expense of safety or quality. The fast track approval process\nwill also have an impact on the stock market. On April\ntwenty ninth, the White House's announcement on Gilead's remdesivir led to\na two point seven percent gain for the S&P, and shares of\nGilead's Sciences also jumped by five point seven percent in\na single day.

cruise company it's been absolute chaos cruise lines have been hit hard as you know bookings and earnings estimates are dropping right along with the stock as a little is had to be expected Princess Cruises have suspended cruises for 60 days shares of Carnival Royal Caribbean and Norwegian cruise lines are all down more than 70 percent in 2020 alone ships from fleets across the world have become sites of kovat 19 spread infecting hundreds of passengers and killing others the pandemic has basically shut down the cruising business with the three largest publicly-traded cruise companies suspending some if not all of their operations every member of the Cruise Lines International Association the body representing the global cruise industry has agreed to suspend operations from US ports of call now ships already at sea are floating without a port to accept them I've only ever seen them close cruise ports for hurricanes or earthquakes and I've seen a lot in the industry I've been through SARS Ebola swine flu bird flu I've seen it all and I've never seen anything like this in the history of the travel business in my 41 years but time after time cruise companies have proven resilient despite seemingly insurmountable setbacks norovirus measles Legionnaires disease e coli collisions and capsizes passengers falling overboard cruise companies have seen it all and they've still mostly bounce back after every major crisis in fact before the corona virus pandemic brought the industry to a standstill 2020 was poised to be a record-breaking year for the cruise business the industry was expecting to carry more than 32 million passengers almost twice as many as in 2009 and they're getting younger travelers on board with 71% of Millennials having a more positive attitude about cruising compared to 2017 the one thing they like is they can see a lot of destinations without having to pack and unpack so being able to take a cruise to go to all those different ports it's fine dining is what you typically get in all the restaurants all your entertainment is included you figure about 80% of your trip is prepaid so you get your room your board and your entertainment included but some experts say that this crisis is different for one thing the government has effectively temporarily canceled an entire industry the State Department has advised that no American should step foot on a cruise ship the top US coronavirus official also not mincing words during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press say no large crowds no long trips and above all don't get on a cruise ship the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which typically just posts health notices for destinations not forms of transport came out to warn travelers against all cruise travel worldwide well I mean in over 30 years is it's unprecedented we've never seen you know these types of warnings really ever unlike past norovirus outbreaks passengers have been forced to quarantine on an unprecedented scale either aboard the ships or a US military bases after disembarking cruise companies are rapidly hemorrhaging money and so far the US government has made it clear that it won't be lending a hand to help bail them out the question now will the global cruise business bounce back like it's done countless times before or is this the end of cruising as we know it [Music] Carnival has been at the heart of the cruise industry struggle against the köppen 19 outbreak the diamond princess a vessel operated by Carnival corpse Princess Cruises now lives in infamy as one of the first major outbreaks of Coe bid 19 yes so one of the big mistakes that they made was that they kept people on the ship that they basically made it into this larger petri dish let people intermingle let them share spaces let them interact not only with each other but with the crew as well who weren't trained in infection control procedures and so it really got out of hand pretty quickly and I think it probably would have been better if they had immediately evacuated everyone from this ship and got them somewhere else where they could have been been quarantined Tyler and Rachel Torres were on that ship they spent 27 days in quarantine 24 hours after they tested her being a throat swab and we found out that we were going to quarantine on the boat for 14 days see the 10 positive cases of Nam occur where they didn't tell us who was positive he just kind of took you off like The Hunger Games right ultimately more than 700 passengers and crew on that ship tested positive for the virus and at least eight people died in March 2022 more carnaval own ships the Grand Princess and holland America's and Damned became sites of coronavirus outbreak carnival struggles have rippled into the wider industry ports around the world have denied entry to cruise vessels and travelers have canceled trips on mass Carnival did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment but in an interview with Axios that aired on HBO the company's CEO tried to make the case that it isn't any riskier being on board a cruise ship than on land that's all I'm suggesting is that a cruise ship is not a riskier environment people perceive it that way but the reality is is not this directly contradicts the CDC's guidance that cruise passengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases including Kovan 19 with the government also warning Americans against traveling by cruise ship the largest cruise companies in the world were effectively forced to shut down operations in March 2020 as the of a crackdown by authorities loomed while the cases of copán 19 on cruise lines comprise a small percentage of the overall global pandemic cruise companies are in an especially precarious position cruise ships are particularly susceptible to outbreak because it's very easy for things to spread on the ship just about any type of gastrointestinal or respiratory pathogen in theory could be spread on these cruise ships yeah you're you're living in close quarters with individuals you're sharing lots of things you're sharing common dining areas common recreation areas going to you know the casinos or the dance floors or things like that or the lounging by the pool and sharing deck chairs sharing towels I mean all of these things are can be potentially vehicles for sharing these pathogens so it's just a lot of that really intense exposure over you know a week or 10 days or so that you're on this cruise and then of course you're often going from port to port as well so you have the potential to pick up any pathogens that are circulating into towns that you stop in and bring them back on the cruise ship as well so it's really just a perfect scenario to acquire and spread these organisms unlike past outbreaks industry experts think that Copa 19 will fundamentally alter the cruising model you know the worst case scenario that frankly we didn't even envision well I don't think frankly we're gonna get back to normalcy frankly could take years you know even under the best case in area where there's containment of this virus it could literally take up to a year for things to get back to any semblance of normalcy chairs of the three largest publicly-traded cruise line companies Carnival Royal Caribbean and Norwegian have collapsed in 2020 alone carnival stock is plummeted 74% Caribbean 78% and Norwegian close to 82% as of March 31st putting the valuations of the big three at multi-year lows Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Grambling thinks royal in Norwegian will end up outperforming Carnival given that nearly half of carnivals cruise brands have been battered in the press over its struggles with Kovan 19 well it's - chief rivals have had limited exposure but Carnival is no stranger to calamity and when its stock price has taken a hit it's shown it can recover over the years it's faced every disaster you can think of fires stranded vessels colliding ships pipe bursts and mass flooding but perhaps its two biggest scars are the sinking of the Costa Concordia off the Italian coast killing thirty two and the infamous Carnival Triumph which gripped global media my entire room flooded so Eckerd from what the toilet the shower everything my feet were I mean the floor was squishy however Carnival wasn't defeated it sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into upgrading its systems across the fleet and it gave the Carnival Triumph its own two hundred million dollar makeover plus a new name of all these debacles the only serious outsized move you see in the stock price at least initially is from the Costa Concordia and it came back strong after that that said as of late things haven't been looking quite as good for Carnival stock it's been steadily declining since 2018 and it began 2020 at a lower share price than in 2016 credit rating agency S&P downgraded Carnival on March 13 2020 and says it's continuing to monitor the big three for downgrades despite the onslaught of bad news Carnival still dominates the market it's the world's largest cruise operator accounting for nearly 50 percent of all cruise passengers in 2018 the most recent year this data was made available by trade publication cruise market watch and up until its brush with Cova 19 its fundamentals were solid sales for Carnival had been strong rising every year since 2015 and more than ten percent from fiscal year 2018 to 2019 that's nearly double the revenue of Royal Caribbean and more than three times Norwegian sales in fiscal year 2019 its net profit also Dwarfs the competition though it's been struggling to maintain growth but Carnival remains nimble especially in the face of crisis as the cruise industry shuts down Carnival is quick to free up its access to cash to tide it over on top of the 518 million dollars it already had on hand Carnival tapped its entire three billion dollar credit facility it also said on March 31st that it's raising six billion dollars in stock and debt an important move when you don't know how many months you have to survive with little to no income it's a long term viability also promising when you consider carnivals debt to equity ratio it's a measure used to help evaluate a company's risk the higher the ratio the greater the risk because it signifies the company has been fueling its growth through borrowing carnivals debt to equity ratio is forty five point three percent which is considered a good balance between what it owes and what it owns compare that to its two chief rivals Norwegian and Royal Caribbean are around 100 percent both took on a lot of debt at a time when debt was cheap which may prove difficult to pay back during a rough patch like this but Carnival also has its own payments coming due plus the four point eight billion dollars it's committed to spending on new ships in 2020 the Kovach 19 outbreak has laid waste to entire sectors of the global economy but none faster than the cruise industry but the forty five point six billion dollar business is making the case that if it goes down it could bring the wider economy with it and a statement to share the news that the industry would be voluntarily suspending travel the cruise lines International Association made it clear just how critical a role it plays in the US economy quote the cruise industry is a vital artery for the US economy supporting over four hundred and twenty-one thousand American jobs with every 30 cruisers supporting one US job and annually contributes nearly 53 billion dollars to the US economy cruise activity supports travel agencies airlines hotels and abroad supply chain of industries that stretches across the United States the organization is also rolling out new industry-wide protocols to ensure public health on board so without going into the details of our plan from a public health perspective we have already to effect a lot of screening protocols in terms of people's ability to get on board if they've been in one of the prohibited countries in the last 14 days they can't come on board a cruise ship so we are going to elevate our screening protocols then once the guests are on board we are going to elevate the way in which we care for them visa be the realities of kovat 19 and as soon as we can test in volume and I know you were just addressing that a few minutes ago we will incorporate testing into our daily and weekly care for our guests and then should there be any kind of event involving assist suspected or confirmed case we are going to be very prepared as an industry and in a self-sufficient way to handle the transportation and logistics and care for all the guests and crew who are on that particular ship those CEOs from the top cruise company is met with vice-president pence in Florida on March 7th 2020 to talk through the dire state of the cruise business the industry's trade group told CNBC its lobbying efforts had been targeted toward helping its travel agent members rather than the cruise operators themselves now whether they were asking for the cash or not it was a big blow when the government effectively excluded the cruise industry from its two trillion dollar bailout to qualify it would have needed to a have been created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the US and B have significant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the US the biggest names in the cruise business don't meet the criteria for example though its headquarters is in Miami and it shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange Carnival is actually incorporated in Panama Royal Caribbean and Norwegian cruise lines are incorporated in Liberia and Bermuda respectively this has enabled some cruise companies to pay little to no federal taxes to the US government Cruise Lines also tend to hire foreign workers who don't always fall under the protection of American minimum wage requirements Carnival and Royal Caribbean did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment no region opted not to give an interview but in a securities filing from March 2020 Carnival said quote we cannot predict when any of our ships will begin to sail again and ports will reopen to our ships moreover even once travel advisories and restrictions are lifted demand for cruises may week for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if and when each brand will return to pre outbreak demand or fair pricing some have likened the current plight of a cruise industry to that of the airline's when the government shut down airports following the September 11th terrorist attacks in the u.s. travel demand tanked and several major American carriers declared bankruptcy despite the support of federal aid and this is like the cruise lines 911 all the bad publicity that it has taken place with you know large ships where you got 2500 passengers onboard at 4,000 passengers and seven 700 sick I mean it is created you know it's no different when they took those airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center people watch that over and over and over that's all you saw in the news everybody was afraid to travel to stave off a similar outcome cruise line companies are trying to book out their post pandemic travel seasons slashing ticket prices in order to draw back customers they're also trying to rehabilitate their image Carnival is offered its vessels is floating hospitals in an effort to mitigate the strain on facilities already pushed past their capacity on shore another boost to the cruising brand billionaire Richard Branson is getting his skin in the game Branson is launching the first ship and his carbon neutral virgin voyages fleet in August 2020 with a mission to attract millennial passengers think young professionals happy to pay a premium for a luxury family free environment but it also now we've got you know people from all the various different virgin companies we can pull together when we launch a new venture like this we can get a big big blank sheet of paper out and we can fill in that paper and we can work out all the things we don't like about other people's cruise ships and all the things that we feel we should do on our cruise ship and and I think you know the I mean that what the wonderful thing is it's all very well doing on a bit of paper but the proof of the pudding is in is in the ship itself this kind of move could inspire confidence across the industry another possibility for the cruise business go smaller I have seen a lot of advertisements come across my computer lately for from different tour companies and read a few stories that they're trying to promote small cruise travel Viking cruises for one is coming out with Viking River Cruises in the United States they're gonna be going down the Mississippi River and a smaller ship so I think this may bring back small cruising again because people actually they look busy but even still analysts watching from the sidelines remain bearish on the industry's ability to recover I think if you look at sort of the whole tourism segment I think that this is going to be a painful for all of them but airlines will likely recover people will get back on planes I think that hotels will also recover but I think cruises may actually have a hard time investors we spoke to remain worried about getting into cruise stocks not just because of all the losses right now but because there's a feeling that people won't want to cruise again however the global head of Cruise Lines International Association remains confident that the industry will bounce back we're a resilient travel sector we're a resilient bunch of people there are a lot of leaders in our industry who have been in in the segment for decades we've been through other remarkable and unprecedented and unforeseen challenges we'll get through this one too

It entered the country in 1995,\nand since then it's expanded rapidly. There are over 1300 dominoes across\n282 cities in India and its footprint continues to grow. Domino's has market share of\nmore than 70 percent. Domino's in India is even testing\ndelivery in 20 minutes or less. That's made it difficult for Pizza\nHut and Papa John's to compete. Even local Indian pizza rivals haven't\nbeen able to match Domino's success. So what is Domino's doing\nthat is so different from the competition? It's localized its product\nofferings, but probably the biggest differentiator, ust like in the\nU.S., Domino's is winning the pizza war in India because it\noffers fast delivery and sophisticated ordering technology. Domino's success has made it more\ndifficult for other chains to flourish. Papa John's left India in\n2017, closing 66 doors, according to its 2017 financial filings. And Pizza Hut footprint has\nstayed relatively small compared to Domino's, despite its early\nentry to the market. On March 24th, 2020. India announced a 21 day lockdown\nduring the Corona virus outbreak instead of closing its\nstores across the country. Domino's India offers zero contact\ndelivery and pickup to its customers, according to\nthe chain's website. Domino's India has taken strategic steps\nto stop the spread of coronavirus by making sure company\nemployees pass medical checks, temperature screenings for employees\nbefore entering restaurants, sanitizing protocols for equipment, bags\nand delivery boxes every four hours. And employees must\nwash their hands every hour. Pizza Hut has offered similar contactless\ndelivery, but the brand is still outnumbered by\nDomino's store count. It has across the subcontinent. So how has Domino's\nwon India's pizza war? The pizza market in India is\nvalued at over $1.5 billion. That's small compared to the U.S. market, which is worth\n$46.7 billion dollars. Still, the market is huge considering\nthe huge population that India has. But when Domino's and Pizza\nHut started operations in India in 1995 and 1996, respectively, the\npizza market was much smaller. It wasn't until July 1991 that India's\nleaders decided to open up its economy, marking the\nbeginning of globalization. India removed subsidies on some items,\nlowered some import duties and invited foreign competition in. With globalization came American\nbrands like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Domino's. When international pizza chains entered\nIndia in the 1990s, some experts say it wasn't immediately\ncompatible with local tastes. Pizza in India strikes a delicate\nbalance between being too foreign and not foreign enough. They've been able to kind of walk\nthe tightrope or the balancing act between localizing to an extent that\nis definitely needed to be successful in the Indian market. But again being able to balance\nthat with, you know, being perceived as, you know, that the top\npizza brand in the U.S. and globally, not just in India. That brings a lot of credibility to the\nbrand and is why a lot of people want to want to have\nit in comparison to others. Domino's success is also thanks\nto India's huge millennial population. In general, millennials are more\nlikely than their older counterparts to eat food from a restaurant. Use technology, travel and\nembrace new foods. Millennials account for about two thirds\nof the population in India. And research shows that Indian\nmillennials love eating out, spending three times as much on restaurant\nvisits than other forms of entertainment. Nielsen research found\nthat middle income urban millennials spend roughly 10 percent of\ntheir food budget on eating at restaurants. That's significantly higher\nthan the 3 percent spent by their Gen X counterparts. As pizza's popularity grows, Domino's has\nfound a huge market in India as of the end of 2019. India is Domino's second largest\nmarket after the U.S.. It's a different story\nfor Pizza Hut. Its business in India makes up\na small fraction of Pizza Hut. Overall business, the country accounts for\njust one percent of system sales. China, on the other hand, accounts\nfor 17 percent of Pizza Hut sales. More and more local restaurants\nare starting to offer pizza, too. Let's say the top 10 cities\nin India, you would have at least seven to eight brands of pizza which\nare there and would offer at least about who would operate at\nleast five stores in that city. But experts say no Indian chains are\non the verge of becoming national chains. Most are small and privately\nheld, so they're not competing on a national level\nwith American chains. In India, there appears to be a lot\nof room for growth in the pizza industry. Domino's local franchise Jubilant\nFoodWorks had sales of $510 million in fiscal year 2013,\n18 percent higher than the previous year, according to FactSet. In fact, Jubilant FoodWorks sales have\nseen double digit growth for 13 out of the last 14 fiscal years. Jubilant FoodWorks also runs Dunkin in\nIndia and operates its own Chinese food chain. But Pizza is the company's most\nprofitable business segment by far, making up 78 percent of\nits revenue, according to FactSet. Domino's footprint in India is huge\ncompared to its rival Pizza Hut, which has 430 restaurants, according\nto its Web site. Domino's has 1,325 stores across 282\ncities as of December thirty first 2019. And it's been adding stores\nsteadily across new cities. They are adding about 200\nplus cities in India. And if I look at the potential,\nthey have the potential of expanding to about 500 cities in the country. So that's fairly substantial. Papa John's entered India nearly a decade\nand a half after its rivals, Domino's and Pizza Hut had\ncome onto the scene. By the time Papa John's expanded into\nIndia, some experts say it was already too late. By the time Papa Jones entered\nthe Indian industry, Domino's hand-up is ahead have already established\nand therefore brand in. Many of the consumers used to prefer\nDomino's Pizza Hut to whip up business because of the affordability,\nbut Papa John's was prized higher. Papa John's tried to close the\ngap in 2014 by acquiring Pizza Corner, a south Indian chain. At the time of the deal, Papa\nJohn's had 15 stores through its master franchisee for the region, a company\ncalled Ohm Pizza and Eats Papa. John said the acquisition of Pizza\nCorner would expand its presence by at least 40 restaurants. Papa John's had restaurants in 11\nIndian cities, according to its Twitter account. Its stores were\nconcentrated in the southern and western parts of the country. But some experts say it was a mistake\nnot to branch out to more rural cities. India is a massive country,\nit both population and size part of Domino strategy to familiarize Indians\nwith the brand was expanded to smaller cities and rural\nareas, not just one region. Developing a restaurant network at a\nnational level in India is challenging due to its huge\nsize and cultural differences between states. But Domino's made it work. But Domino's has invested heavily in\nrural areas and not just the cities. And I do think that is an\nimportant point as to why they have been successful in particular in\ncomparison to their competitors, their main competitors, such as Pizza\nHut and Papa John's having access to something like pizza is like\nhaving access to the rest of the world feeling like you're a\npart of global consumer culture and that you can try\nsomething that's different. It has a tremendous amount of\nsymbolic value, and I think Domino's has recognized that and that people are\nwilling to kind of pay for that. Papa John's shut its indie\noperations in 2017, according to local media reports, experts say. Papa John's just couldn't stand\nout against the competition. In the U.S., dominos one, the pizza\nwars thanks to delivery and tech innovation. It's a similar\nnarrative in India. India has a huge population of\nInternet users, second only to China. That number is expected to grow, fueled\nby the declining cost of data and smartphones in developing\neconomies like India. Smart bombs are cheaper\noption than personal computers. All this means that the Indian\nmarket is perfect for smartphone apps. Domino's franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks says\nit was the first food service company to launch online\nand mobile ordering nationally in India. Analysts agree and say\nthat Domino's introduced the online ordering culture. And as of January\n2020, nearly 30 million people downloaded Domino's mobile\nordering app. If you look at a market like\nin India, Internet is mostly used through mobiles. So mobile administration is a\nvery high compared to that of a laptop or desktop. So Domino's were very quick to launch\na mobile app and they also see high ordering retro mobiles in\n2013 online in mobile orders contributed about 17 percent of delivery\nsales at Domino's by the end of fiscal year 2019. Online ordering contributed seventy five\npercent of delivery sales. Domino's has stood out in\nthe Indian delivery market guaranteeing customers free pizza if a delivery\ntakes 30 minutes or longer. Domino's even tested a 20 minutes\nor less delivery guarantee in some Indian cities and offers all\nnight delivery in multiple cities. While Domino's has succeeded in delivery\nand with its mobile app, experts say Pizza Hut was focused more\non dining in just like it has in the U.S.. Some consumers prefer that,\nbut it means that Pizza Hut needs to rent large and usually\nmore expensive real estate to offer seating. I may have to travel to\na particular point in the city just to eat at a Pizza Hut or a\nPizza Express that at times it takes away from, though, you know, the desire to\ngo there or you're not just ordering, then you're\nmore comfortable. While many fast food brands look\nto China for growth, Domino's has struggled there. The company attributes that\nto the fact that cheese and bread aren't part of\na traditional Chinese diet. In India, the pizza chain\nhasn't had that problem. Domino's tries to make sure its\nmenu is well-suited to every country. It expands into. In addition to offering American\nstaples like sausage and veggie, Domino's, India serves pies topped\nwith familiar ingredients like chicken tikka paneer cheese\nand red paprika. Chicken is the most\npopular meat in India. And Hindus don't eat beef, which\nis why chicken dominates the online menu at Domino's. It's even hyper localized its products\nby region etting menu items more suited to tastes\nin certain states. For instance, in 2014, South Indian\ncustomers got a spicy banana pizza. Green bananas are often\nused in traditional South Indian dishes. Domino's localize more\nthan its menu. It tailored each restaurant\nto local conditions, too. In small cities where people eat out\nas a family, the restaurants are larger and have space\nfor customers dining in. In another huge differentiator, Domino's offers\npies at a lower price than Pizza Hut see when\nthey launched in the 1990s. Not very many people wanted\nto have a pizza. So you had to bring them to\nthe level of acceptability that, you know, you come in and have a\npizza or you order a pizza. Also, if you look at the kind\nof prices that are there, Domino's does awful pizzas, which would be for I think\nif I have to put it across an American dollar terms, which would\nbe less than a dollar.

He discusses the pay gap, patriarchy and his new book """"12 Rules for Life."""" Subscribe: http://bit.ly/2mFYm8e.",Channel 4 News,aMcjxSThD54,"[""Juden peterson you've said that men need to quote grow the hell up tell me why well because there's nothing uglier than an old infant there's nothing good about it it people who don't grow up don't find the sort of meaning in their life that sustains them through difficult times and they are certain to encounter difficult times and they're left bitter and resentful and without purpose and adrift and hostile and resentful and vengeful and arrogant and deceitful and and of no use to themselves and of no use to anyone else and no partner for a woman and there's nothing in it that's good so you said I mean that sounds pretty bad yes Isis of masculinity I mean what do you do about it you tell you help people understand why it's necessary and important for them to grow up and adopt responsibilities why that isn't a shake your finger and get your act together sort of thing why it's more like but why it's more like a delineation of the kind of destiny that makes life worth living I've been telling young men but it's not I wasn't specifically aiming this message at young men to begin with it just kind of turned out that way and it's mostly you admit it's mostly men listening I mean it is your audience is well it's about 80 percent on on YouTube which is a YouTube is a male domain primarily so it's hard to tell how much of it is because YouTube is male and how how much of it is because of what I'm saying but you you what I've been telling young men is that there's an actual reason why they need to grow up which is that they have something to offer you know that that that people have within them this capacity to set the world straight and that's necessary to manifest in the world and that also doing so is where you find the meaning that sustains you in life so what's gone wrong then oh god all sorts of things have gone wrong I think that I don't think that young men are here words of encouragement some some of them never in their entire lives as far as I can tell that's what they tell me and the fact that the words that I've been that I've been speaking the YouTube lectures that I've done and put online for example have had such a dramatic impact is indication that young men are starving for this sort of message because like why in the world would they have to derive it from a lecture on YouTube now they're not being taught that they that it's important to develop yourself because it doesn't bother you that your audience is predominantly male does that isn't isn't that a bit divisive no I don't think so I mean it's no more divisive than the fact that YouTube is primarily male and tumblr is primarily my female resident tumblr is primarily female all right you're just saying that's the way it is oh it's I'm not saying anything it's just an observation that that's the way it is there's plenty of women that are watching my lectures and coming to my talks and buy my books it's just that the majority of them happen to be men uh it's what's in it for the women though well what sort of partner do you want you want an overgrown child or do you want someone to contend with that's going to help you your eye on women have some sort of duty to sort of help fix the crisis masculinity it depends on what they want no I mean it's exactly exactly how I laid it out like women want deeply want men who are competent and powerful and and I don't mean power in in the in in the in that they can exert tyrannical control over others that's not power that's just corruption power is competence and why in the world would you not want a competent partner well I know why actually you can't dominate a competent partner so if you want more you should dominate is that what you're saying no I'd say women who have had their relationships impaired with impaired their relationships with men impaired and who are afraid of such relationships will settle for a weak partner because they can dominate them but it's a suboptimal solution do you know when they were doing I think there's a substantial minority of women who do that and I think it's very bad for them they're very unhappy it's very bad for their partners although the partners get the advantage of not having to take any responsibility what gives you the right to say that I mean maybe that's how women want their relationships those women I mean you're making these vast generalizations I'm a clinical psychologist right so you've you're saying you've done your research and women are unhappy dominating men I didn't say they were unhappy dominating then I said it was a bad long-term solution okay you said it was making them Israel yes yes and it depends on the time frame I mean there can be there's intense pleasure in momentary domination that's why people do it all the time but its nose formula for a long-term successful long-term relationship that's reciprocal right any long-term relationship is reciprocal firstly by definition so let me put it quite to you from the bank well you say there are whole disciplines in universities forthrightly hostile towards men these are the areas of study dominated by the postmodern stroke neo-marxist claim the Western culture in particular is an oppressive structure created by white men to dominate and exclude women but then I want to put minorities - okay but I want to put to you that here in the UK for example let's say that as an example the gender pay gap stands at just over 9% you've got women at the BBC recently saying that the broadcaster is illegally paying them less than men to do the same job you've got only seven women running the top footsie 100 companies hum so it seems to a lot of women that they still being dominated and excluded to quote your words back to you it does seem that way but multivariate analysis of the pay gap indicate that it doesn't exist nine percent cap ager that's a gap between median hourly earnings between men and women yeah but there's multiple reasons for that one of them is gender but it's not the only reason like if you're a social scientist worth worth your salt you never do a univariate analysis like you say well women in aggregate are paid less than men okay well then we break it down by age we break it down by occupation we break it down by interest we break it down by personality but you're saying basically it doesn't matter if women aren't getting to the top because that's what's skewing that gender pay gap isn't it you're saying well that's just a fact not so you know it's not going to get to the top no I'm not saying it doesn't matter either you're saying remindful reasons for it even though why should women put up with those reasons why shouldn't women because he should put up with it I'm saying that the claim that the wage gap between men and women is only due to sex is wrong and it is wrong there's no doubt about that the multivariate analysis have been done mighty very I'm saying that nine percent pay gap exists that's a gap between men and women I'm not saying why it exists but it exists now you're a woman wack seems pretty unfair you have to say why it exists but do you agree that it's unfair if you're a woman not necessary and on average you're getting paid nine percent less than a man that's not fair is it it depends on why it's happening I can give you an example okay there's a personality trait known as agreeableness agreeable people are compassionate and polite and agreeable people get paid less than just didn't less agreeable people for the same job women are more agreeable than men again a vast generalizations agreeable ears that's true but that's right and some women get paid more than men so you were saying that by and large women are too agreeable to get the pay raises I see so I'm saying that that's one component of a multivariate equation that predicts celery it accounts for maybe five percent of the variance something like that I should be neat about the other twenty you need about another eighteen factors one of which is gender and there is prejudice there's no doubt about that but it accounts for a much smaller proportion of the variance in the pay gap then the radical feminists claim okay so rather than denying the pay gap exists which is what you did at the beginning of this conversation shouldn't you say to women rather than being agreeable and not asking for a pay rise go and ask for a pay raise make yourself disagreeable with your book oh definitely there's that but I also didn't deny it existed I denied it existed because of gender okay because I'm very very very careful with my words so the pay gap exists you accept that but you're saying I mean the pay gap between men and women exists you're saying it's not because of gender it's because women are too agreeable to ask for pay rises certainly one of the reasons okay one of the reason so why not get them to ask for a pay rise I've done that many many times in my career and they just don't sort oh they do it all the time you can see so one of the things that you do as a clinical psychologist is um assertiveness training so you might say often you treat people for anxiety you treat them for depression and you and maybe the next most common category after that would be assertiveness training and so I've had many many women extraordinarily competent women in my clinical and consulting practice and we put together strategies for their career development that involved continual pushing competing for higher wages and often tripled their wages within a five-year period of course so do you do you agree that you would be happy if that pay gap was eliminated completely because that's all the radical feminists are saying it would depend on how it was eradicated and how the how how the disappearance of it was measured and you're saying of men that's a problem oh there's all sorts of things that it could be at the cost of it could even be at the cost of women's own interests so because they might not be happy if they could equal pay no because it might interfere with other things that are causing the pay gap that women are choosing tonight having children well or choosing careers that actually happen to be paid less which women do a lot of but why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children or the right to choose those demanding because they can yeah that's fine but you're saying that makes them unhappy I and large I'm saying that that no I'm not saying that I'm I and I actually haven't said that so far you're saying it makes them miserable no I said what was making them miserable was having part was having weak partners that makes them miserable right I would say that many women around the age of I would say between 28 and 32 have a career family crisis that they have to deal with and I think that's partly because of the for short and timeframe that women have to contend with like women have to get the major pieces of their life put together faster than men which is also partly why men aren't under so much pressure to grow up so because for the typical woman she has to have her career and family in order pretty much by the time she's 35 because otherwise the options start to run out and so that puts a tremendous amount of stress on women especially at the end of their 20s I think I take issue the idea of the typical woman because you know all women are different and I want to just put another quote to you from the book last day in some ways and the same in others okay you say women become more vulnerable when they have children no and you talked to one of your youtube interviews about crazy harpy sisters so a simple question is gender equality a myth in your view is that something that's just never gonna happen it depends on what you mean by equality no if you mean a lien and we're getting the same opportunities fairly people we could get to a point where people were treated fairly or more fairly I mean people are treated pretty fairly in Western culture already but we can look them really not though are they I mean otherwise why would there only be seven women running footsie 100 companies in the UK why why would there still be a pay gap which we've all got satellite sees why are women at the BBC saying that they're getting paid illegally less the men to do the same job that's not fair sort of the first question their brothers are complicated questions seven seven women repeat that one there's seven women running the top footsie 100 companies in the UK well the first it might be um why would you want to do that why would a minute man want to do it I don't know a number of men although not that many who are perfectly willing to sacrifice virtually all of their life to the pursuit of a high-end career so they'll work these are men that are very intelligent they're usually very very conscientious they're very driven they're very high-energy they're very healthy and they're willing to work 70 or 80 hours a week non-stop specialised at one thing to get to the top so you think women are just more sensible they don't want that because it's not a nice level I'm saying that's part of it definitely and so I worry you you don't think there are barriers in their way that prevent them getting to the top there's some barriers yeah like other like men for example I mean to get to the top of any organisation is an incredibly competitive enterprise and the men that you're competing with are simply not going to roll over and say please take the position absolutely all-out warfare is gender equality a myth I don't know what you mean by the question men and women aren't the same and they won't be this that doesn't mean they can't be treated fairly is gender equality desirable if it means equality of outcome then almost certainly it's undesirable that's already been demonstrated in Scandinavia because in Scandinavia equality of outcome is undesirable what men and women won't sort themselves into the same categories if you leave them alone to do it off their own accord I've already seen that in Scandinavia it's 20 to 1 female nurses to male something like that it might not be quite that extreme and approximately the same male engineers to female engineers and that's a consequence of the free choice of men and women in the societies that have gone farther than any other societies to make gender equality the purpose of the law those are in eradicable differences you can eradicate them with tremendous social pressure and tyranny but if you leave men and women to make their own choices you will not get equal outcome right so you're saying that anyone who believes in equality whether you call them feminists call them whatever you want to call them should basically give up because it ain't gonna happen only if they're aiming at equality of outcome so you're saying give people equality of opportunity that's fine not only fine it's eminently desirable for everyone for individuals and for society but still women aren't gonna make it that's what you're really it depends on your measurement techniques they're doing just fine in medicine in fact there are far more female physicians than there are male physicians or there are lots of lots of disciplines that are absolutely dominated by women many many disciplines and they're doing great so let me put something else to you from the book you say the introduction of the equal pay for equal work argument immediately complicates even salary comparison beyond practicality for one simple reason who decides what work is equal it's not possible so the simple question is do you believe in equal pay well I made the argument there it's like it depends and say you don't because a lot of people listening to you will just say I mean are we going back to the Dutch because we're actually not listening I'm just projecting I'm hearing you basically saying women need to just accept they're never gonna make it on equal terms equal outcomes is what how you defined it no I I would go I might as well just go and play with my Cindy dolls give us a ride at school because I'm not going to get the top job I want because there's someone sitting there saying it's not possible that's what they said it's a it's a bad social role I didn't say that women shouldn't be striving for the top or anything like that because I don't believe that for a second striving for the top but you're gonna put all those hurdles in their way as has been in their way for centuries so that's fine you're saying that's fine no no I think I read the paper silly I do I think that's silly I really do I mean look look at your situation you're hardly unsuccessful yeah Maya how do you beg hard to get exactly good that's ok battling is good this is inevitable but you talk about man fuck let me just put another thing to you for now you're saying you have to be idle for a high-quality position well I notice in your book you talk about real conversations between men containing quote an underlying threat of physicality oh there's no doubt about that what about real conversation between women is that something or are we sort of too amenable and reasonable no it's just that the domain of physical conflict is sort of off-limits for you we just to get where I've got yeah but what does that make me I don't know man I don't imagine that you've yeah to some degree I suspect you're not very agreeable so that's the thing successful women I'm not very agreeable right actually in this conversation at least I'm sure I served your career well successful women though hmm basically have to wear the trousers in your view they have to sort of become men to succeed is what you're saying well if the guys had to fight to succeed better Canadians men certainly masculine traits are going to be helpful I mean one of the things I do in my counseling practice for example when I'm consulting with women who are trying to advance their careers is to teach them how to negotiate and to and to be able to say no and to not be easily pushed around and to be formidable and you need to if you're gonna be successful you need to be smart conscientious and tough well here's a radical idea why don't the bosses adopt some male bosses shall we say adopt some female traits so the women don't have to fight and get their sharp elbows out for the pay rises it's just accepted if they're doing the same job they get the same pay well I would say partly because it's not so easy to determine what cost due to the same job an almost because arguably yeah there are still men dominating our industries our society and therefore they've dictated the terms for so long but women have to battle to know like them it's not true it's not true so for example well I can give you an example very quickly so I worked with women who worked in high-powered law firms in Canada for about 15 years and they were as competent and put together as anybody you would ever meet and we were trying to figure out how to further their careers and there was a huge debate in Canadian society at that point that was basically ran along the same lines as your argument is that if the law firms didn't use these masculine criteria then perhaps women would do better but the market sets the damn game it's like and the market is dominated by men no it's not the market is dominated by women they make 80 percent of the consumer decisions that's not the case at all you take people who stay at home looking after children by and large they are still women so they're going out doing the shopping but that is chained they make all decisions okay so the market is driven by women not men right ok and if you're a lawyer you still pay more for the same sort of goods that's been proven that men for the you buy a blue bicycle helmet it's gonna cost less than a pink one anyway we'll come on to that partly because men are less agreeable right so this so they won't put up with it I want to ask you is it not desirable to have some of those female traits you're talking about I'd say that's a generalization but you've used the words female traits is it not desirable to have some of them at the top of business I mean maybe they wouldn't they don't predict they don't predict success in the workplace the things that predict success in the workplace are intelligence and conscientiousness agreeableness negatively predicts success in the workplace negative emotion saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these talk no I didn't say that I said that female traits don't predict success but I didn't say that intelligence it wasn't I didn't say that intelligence and conscientious when you were saying it's just by implication or not female traits oh no I mean that's sorry no dressed her not saying that at all a women is intelligent than men no no they're not no they did that on that's pretty cool the average IQ for a woman and the average IQ for a man is identical there is some debate about the flatness of the distribution which is something that James d'amour pointed out for example in his memo but there's no difference at all in general cognitive ability there's no difference to speak of in conscientiousness women are a bit more orderly than men and men are a little bit more industrious than women the difference isn't big I don't know about averages into con men who aren't necessarily why are they not feminine traits why are they not desirable at the top of feminine traits why they not desirable it's hard to say I'm just laying out the empirical evidence like we know that we know the traits that predict success but we also know because companies by and large have not been dominated by women over the centuries we have nothing to compare it to it's an experiment true and it could be the case that if companies modified their behavior and became more feminine they would be successful there's no evidence for it I'm not neither doubtful nor non doubtful there's no evidence why not give it a go as the radically evidence suggests well it's fine like if someone wants to start a company and make it more feminine and compassionate let's say and caring in its overall orientation towards its workers and towards the marketplace and that's a perfectly reasonable experiment to run my point is that there is no evidence that those traits predict success in the workplace and there's evidence right well that's not that's not really the case women have been in the workplace for at least ever since I've been around the representation of women in the workplace has been about 50 percent so we've run the experiment for a fairly reasonable period of time but not you know certainly not for centuries let me move on to another debate that's been very controversial for you and this is you got in trouble for refusing to call trans men and women by their preferred personal pronouns no it's not actually true I got in trouble because I said I would not follow that compelled speech dictates of the federal and provincial government I actually never got in trouble for not calling anyone anything I wouldn't follow the change of law which was does not once I was law screaming hell no that's all they said it was designed to do okay you cited freedom of speech in that why should your right to freedom of speech Trump a trans persons right not to be offended because in order to be able to think you have to risk being offensive I mean look at the conversation we're having right now you know like you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth why should you have the right to do that it's being rather uncomfortable well I'm I'm very glad I put you well I'm you get my point as like you're you're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on and that is what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me and that's fine I think more power to as far as I'm concerned so you haven't sat there and I'm just right I've just trying to work that out I mean ha gotcha you have got me you have caught me I'm trying to wake up turn my head yeah I took a while it did yeah well you have voluntary cut you have voluntarily come into the studio and agreed to be questioned hmm a trans person in your class has come to your class and said they want to be called that's never happened and I would call them she so you would so you've kind of changed your Chi no no no I said that right from the beginning what I said at the beginning was that I was not going to cede the linguistic territory to radical leftists regardless of whether or not it was put in law that's what I said even then the people who came after me said oh you must be transphobic and you'd mistreat a student in your class it's like I never mistreated a student in my class I'm not transphobic and that isn't what I said well it said you've also called trans campaigners authoritarian how many I mean isn't that only in the broader context of my claims that radical leftist ideologue czar authoritarian which they always say someone who's trying to work out their gender identity who may well have struggled with that though I'm a drug use you're comparing them with you know Chairman Mao who know just you know the deaths of millions of people just even if the activists you know they're trans people too they have a right to say these things yeah but they don't have a brain inside their whole community heaven too Chairman Mao you know I could finish a all cost a penny sure I mean you know this is grossly insensitive and I didn't compare them to finish it well I did come here knowing he knows no authority he's a right-winger though I was comparing them to the left-wing totalitarians and I are left now at Aryans under Mao millions of people die right mean there's no comparison Mao and a trans activist is there why not because trans activist aren't killing millions of people the philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy the consequences are yet you're saying that trans activists know it leads to the deaths of millions of people well no I'm saying that the philosophy that drives their utterances is the same philosophy that already has driven us to the deaths of millions okay tell us how that philosophy is in any way comparable sure that's no problem the first thing is is that their philosophy presumes that group identity is paramount that's the fundamental philosophy that drove the Soviet Union and Mao is China and it's the fundamental philosophy of the left-wing activists it's identity politics doesn't matter who you are as an individual it matters who you are in terms of your group identity you just say murder so to provoke on you I mean you are a provocateur never say a lightly they don't write that you hate to be compared to you want to stir things up I'm only a provocateur insofar as when I say what I believe to be true it's provocative I don't provoke maybe four heroes out now and then I'm not interested in provoking what about leading about you know fighting and the lobster tell us about the lobster ha well that's quite a segue well the first chapter I have in my book is called stand up straight with your shoulders back and it's an injunction to be combative not least to further your career let's say but also to adopt a stance of ready engagement with the world and to reflect that in your posture and the reason that I write about lobsters is because there's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy and that is so untrue that it's almost unbelievable and I use the lobster as an example because the lobster we we divulged from lobsters in evolutionary history about 350 million years ago common ancestor and lobsters exist in hierarchies and have a nervous system attuned to the hierarchy and that nervous system runs on serotonin just like our nervous systems do and the nervous system of the lobster and the human being is so similar that antidepressants work on lobsters and it's part of my attempt to demonstrate that the idea of hierarchy has absolutely nothing to do with socio-cultural constructions which it doesn't let me just get it straight you're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organizing organize their structures it's it's absolutely inevitable and there is one third of a billion years of evolutionary history behind that right that's that's so long that a third of the billion years ago there weren't even trees it's a long time you have a mechanism in your brain that runs on serotonin that's similar to the lobster mechanism that tracks your status and the higher your status the better your emotions are regulated so as your serotonin levels increase you feel more positive the emotion and less negative emotion so you're saying like the lobsters we're hardwired as men and women to do certain things to sort of run along tram lines and there's nothing we can do about it no I'm not saying there's nothing we can do about it because it's like in a chess game all right there's lots of things that you can do although you can't break the rules of the chess game and continue to play chess and biological you're your biological nature is somewhat like that is it sets the rules of the game but within those rules you have a lot of leeway but the idea that but one thing we can't do is say that hierarchical organization is a consequence of the capitalist patriarchy it's like that's patently absurd it's wrong it's not a matter of opinion it's seriously wrong on you just whipping people up into a state of anger and not of all the divisions between men and women you're disturbing people up you know you have any critics of you online get absolutely lambasted by your followers young generally sorry your critics get lambasted by you I mean if there are not at all if an academic is gonna come to me and tell me that I'm not qualified and that I'm not I don't know what I'm talking about now quit the abuse quit the anger well we need some substantial examples of the abuse and the anger before I could detail that quest there 'he's a lot of alpha4 well let's take a more general perspective on that so I have had 25,000 letters since June something like that from people who

employers who are willing to hire on an episode of the Australian podcast please explain China correspondent Eric Bagshaw weighed in on the China Australian relationship he says China taking a more assertive position against an investigation as an example of its wolf warrior diplomacy he says China will do anything to block the investigation and has increased its pressure on Australia even threatening economic retaliation if Australia doesn't back off but back Shaw added that all China has its wolf for a diplomacy Australia has its own response known as The Wolverine Club which has been set up to respond forcefully and directly to any threats from China there are even half a dozen federal parliamentarians who now have Wolverine claw marks on their offices the UK's national

Chinese think-tank has raised debates among China watchers the article argues that China should try to win over America left-wing in order to fix the deteriorating us-china relationship the us-china relationship is arguably at a new low chinese state media has called state secretary Mike Pompeo an enemy of humankind for criticizing China while the Trump administration has reportedly vowed to hold the Chinese regime accountable for the cover-up with the 2020 election coming up a recent article by a Chinese think-tank has caught the attention and raised debates among China watchers on Twitter what kind of candidate what China wants and what does it mean for the future of us-china relations the article is titled in order to improve the us-china relationship why do we have to win over America's left wing this came not long before President Donald Trump said he believes that Beijing will do anything they can to make him lose in 2020 the author of the article referred to those American left-wing or liberal elites who think they know a lot about China as China knowers or Juke wop high and recounted their contribution to China's rise over the years the article reads if not for the Clinton government's policy to engage with China in the 1990s how could I have had such a nice outside environment for economic growth the article said that because the American Left is too naive and arrogance they think the u.s. engagement with China will eventually help the regime embrace more liberal democratic values it adds that they had drawn wrong conclusions it's exactly their mistakes that we took advantage of and won over opportunities for our own development and reduce the resistance to our uprising the author noted that although past administrations on both the left and the right had pushed for engagement with China the situation is different now but today the article read the gap between China and the US interest is too huge there is no overlap there is no common strategic interest if we want to improve the two countries relationship through America's right wing that means we have to make huge compromises in our political system and economic model this is something we cannot accept the author wrote that the so-called China knowers are still really important for influencing Washington's policies therefore they're still considered targets that China should try to win over the Washington Post's China correspondent Gary she called the article Frank and cynical while hugging lien a new york-based Chinese scholar wrote on Twitter that China is looking for substitutes for the Panda huggers the term refers the Western academics and officials who had championed engagement with China and believe that China's rise is a good thing for the world but in recent years some of China's previous champions have become increasingly skeptical in 2018 over 30 of the world's top China experts published a report calling China out for its covert coercive or corrupting operations many of them had previously advocated for China's rise the report pointed out that the regime has been trying to undermine America's democratic process through its influence on the Chinese American community Chinese students in the u.s. American civil society organizations academic institutions think tanks and the media one China expert told The Washington Post that the report speaks to the disillusionment of an entire generation of China's specialists who thought they were helping China emerge onto the world stage only to discover that the project had gone badly awry a Taiwanese scholar called the report a collective awakening of China experts it remains to be seen how deep this awakening will run but the Chinese regime's influence on Washington's China policies over the years cannot be dismissed chinese state media reported that in november 2008 right after the presidential election result was revealed a research institute under the US state department reached out to their Chinese counterparts it asked for their expectation lists on China policies the new president received the report immediately after he took power in January 2009 the report is titled the pivotal relationship how Obama should engage China half of it was ran by a researcher named Leo Shui Chun from the China Institute of International Studies an institute under the Chinese regimes Ministry of Foreign Affairs the researcher told state media that although it's partly his report it actually represents China it's common for newly elected presidents to receive policy advice reports but one co-authored by a Chinese national under the regime central government is unprecedented in US history new york-based China Scholar hushing the an wrote at the time that it was no different than telling Beijing please let me know how shall I work with you in order to satisfy you the policy report ask the White House to respect China's core interests to work with the Chinese regime on Taiwan issues and not to arrange meetings with to ban activists the 2009 report expressed hope that the new administration will make its blood points in public but save it specific human rights questions those about particular individuals for private deliberations with the Chinese the messages appear to have been well received during then President Obama's visit to China in 2009 and his receiving Xi Jinping's visit to Washington in 2015 Obama had faced criticisms for his softer stance on China's human rights issues his administration officials reassured the media that the then president pulled no punches in private meetings but some say the reality we are facing today clearly proves that the behind closed doors approach hasn't worked and needs changing where China wants to keep these issues is behind closed doors I notice your pre many of your previous diplomatic and diplomats who testified say we're working very hard behind closed doors to press the case of the two Michaels and other issues well that's exactly where China wants to keep it is behind closed doors I think personally going public about China's egregious behavior on a wide range of issues whether it's Tibet The Weavers the - Michaels leo Xiao hua you name it China just hates being internationally called out publicly and change the u.s. is now suffering due to the Chinese regime's lack of transparency and totalitarian rule China silencing of whistleblowers and

Biden are now in a race to see who can be tougher with China Trump who has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas is reportedly ramping up efforts to remove supply chains from China he's also said to be Wang new tariffs to punish Beijing's handling of the virus outbreak at the same time Biden has criticized Trump in a campaign ad for trusting China too much The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the former vice president's current foreign policy advisors are almost all veterans of the Obama administration Biden has yet to come up with specific of his China policies reporting by penny Jo NTD news China is introducing a new digital currency backed by its central bank it's said to make payments faster and easier but an analyst warns it could be used to tighten the regime's control of the Chinese people nd DS Catherine when has the details China is testing a new digital currency with a pilot program it's set to be the first digital currency used by a major economy after years of development the program began last month in four Chinese cities starting in May some government workers will receive part of their paychecks in the digital currency to use it they need to install an app the currency's value is pegged to the UN unlike other crypto currencies the digital yen is issued and backed by the Chinese central bank it's not decentralized and won't provide the same anonymity as other cryptocurrencies do popping pushing it's not an independent currency itself it's just the digital version of the Chinese renminbi fact there's always a central authority in this digital renminbi system that's the Chinese communist regime according to a professor from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School the new digital currency aims to replace Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a system controlled by government authorities tong says due to its centralized structure it would give the authorities more control over the everyday lives of chinese people jimmy the government can directly control each person's wallet and decide how you can spend your own money for example let's say the government paid you a salary of three thousand un if needed it can impose a restriction on your money making it so you can only spend one thousand yen on rice he added the system could also be used to suppress dissidents restrict their access to necessities or in extreme cases seize personal property officials say the digital UN will make paying easier and faster for the Chinese people but Tong says the Chinese regime is testing how much control it can exert over individual financial activity he says the regime also has another motive so you a jungle national with hot sisters the Chinese communist regime has a goal and the plan once this technology matures the regime can use the system to replace the US dollar and is trying to compete for dominance with the u.s. in the global financial system the former governor of China's central bank said last year that the digital currency would eventually be integrated into China's belton Road initiative China has been pushing to make the UN International but the US dollar still

45,0,Better brain health | DW Documentary,"Chocolate reduces stress. Fish stimulates the brain. Is there any truth to such popular beliefs? The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat.A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of Lübeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called """"brain food"""" for example: The Mediterranean diet that’s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

46,0,Climate refugees in Bangladesh | DW Documentary,"Within the next 30 years, up to 20% of Bangladesh will disappear beneath the water as rivers and sea levels rise. This will put as many as 30 million people on the move. Climate researchers say it’s just the first manifestation of a process that will soon be happening all over the world. This film takes us on a journey to the Bangladesh of the future, a country that’s set to suffer terribly from climate change. The Meghna River has already turned into a torrent that’s nine kilometers wide in places, a mass of moving water that flows ten times faster than the Rhine. """"It demolished the house I moved into as a bride,” Momtaj Begum says. """"It’s where I gave birth to my four children. It breaks my heart.” She and her son are saving what they can before the river sweeps everything relentlessly into the sea. Her village looks like a battlefield. The Meghna has cut deep into the ground, and is literally ripping the soil away beneath the residents’ feet. Momtaj Begum and her family of eight have already been turned into climate refugees. Her village was swallowed by the river, along with many others. Around 2,000 displaced people like her arrive in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka every day. With a population topping 20 million and a crumbling infrastructure, the city is on the verge of collapse. The climate refugees that arrive here are now forcibly moved on again, this time by the government. Shantytowns are destroyed by police raids and bulldozers. And what’s happening in Bangladesh is only the beginning. Before long, every country in the world will begin to notice the effects of rising sea levels._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

disasters have become part of everyday life here an entire village is fleeing the effects of climate change [Music] this woman has lost her home where will I live now we're tearing down the house I first came to thirty years ago when I got married I gave birth to my four children they're my two daughters got married there it just breaks my heart [Music] the extreme conditions people here face may soon affect us all six kilometers from here we had two hectares of land to see gobbled them up [Music] [Music] most Bangladeshi climate refugees moved to the mega city of Dhaka the country's capital an estimated 2,000 people arrived in Dhaka every day during monsoon season the number rises to 4,000 today [Music] [Music] the world's second-largest river delta is located on the bay of bengal two large rivers flow through the country from north to south the Brahmaputra and the ganges much of the land in bangladesh is flat and it's numerous rivers often burst their banks the country is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change a real danger for its 160 million people there are a number of factors involved in the impacts of human-induced climate change on the river systems and the water systems firstly the glacier ice melt in the Himalayas the second impact is on flooding we will have greater amounts and intensities of rainfall during the monsoon which will cause more flooding we are already seeing that our what used to be a 1 in 20 year flood has now effectively become a 1 in 5 year flood so the magnitude of floods has increased already and will increase even more with human India's climate change and the third factor are cyclones that come from the Bay of Bengal in the South those are going to become more intense and we are going to have to deal with higher intensity cyclones [Music] even now at the beginning of monsoon season the Brahmaputra is nine kilometres wide at some points it's filled with melted snow from the Himalayas another effect of climate change in future other rivers around the world may experience similar increases in water volume this is where the Brahmaputra merges with the Ganges to become the Padma when these rivers flood it can have a devastating effect on nearby communities as here in the village of hairy rump or here on the left the Patna river destroyed everything in just three days on the right everything was gone in four days the river has covered an area of 61 hectares in our village 300 families lost their homes because of the extreme River erosion I'm really scared our house may be gone soon eleven-year-old mahfooz Hussein walks past an area that used to be a garden [Music] the local residents are preparing to move inland to escape the rising water one of masseuses neighbors says he's not going to let the river take this tree ma fuzes house is 50 yards from the danger zone but the situation here could become worse when monsoon season starts this used to be the center of the village now it looks like a battlefield you can still see the remains of several houses this fragile sapling has become a symbol for the villagers as floods caused by climate change consume the ground beneath their feet until yesterday montage big goon lived in this house with several members of her family including her son his wife and their child I didn't sleep at all last night I'm worried that I'm going to drown in the flood waters the house was the family's pride and joy montages son and some workers are salvaging everything they can from the structure where will I live now my house is gone I'll have to rely on the kindness of others I'm going to have to move to duck huntin find a job so I can afford to come back here buy some land and rebuild my parents home the river flooded the big oom family's farmland two years ago montages husband and her oldest son left to take construction jobs in the United Arab Emirates the younger son Saleem has now also become a climate refugee in his own country I'm so sad my father built this house and now I have to tear it down that really hurts [Music] Mumtaj bakhoum is saying a prayer like I remember where does all this water come from the Ganges flows the longest from the Himalayan mountains into India for about 2,000 kilometers before it comes to Bangladesh much of the water is taken away upstream in India by a series of dams the biggest being the Farakka dam just outside the border of Bangladesh as a result Bangladesh is not receiving as much water as it used to in the dry season the problem is in the monsoon season they open up all the water they let it come through Bangladesh but during the dry season they take the water away and divert it away from one relation we don't get enough water so we have floods in the monsoon period and we have too little water in the dry season [Music] the lives of these people have been severely disrupted by the effects of climate change and the water resource policies of a neighboring country Bangladeshis are left with few options but to try to protect themselves Salim and the others transport the walls and roof of the house deep into the forest he hopes to return to the village one day he hopes that the job he finds in Dhaka will earn him enough money to buy some land here many in the village have similar plans no one here actually wants to go to the capital but they believe they have no other choice [Music] from the money guns region we moved Southwest to the post Scheuer river which flows through the Sundarbans region Sundarbans means beautiful forest in Bengali the area covers 10,000 square kilometers most of it in Bangladesh and it's home to the world's largest mangrove forest region it's also a UNESCO World Heritage Site which under one's is actually seen as the lungs of Bangladesh it absorbs all the pollution for us mr. thundermans protects Bangladesh and if we lose that protection then the country loses its protection the Sundarbans forest helps to protect millions of people from floods that are caused by cyclones it also offers a rich habitat for wildlife including the endangered Bengal tiger the region is the country's largest source of forest based raw materials but its future is under threat the Sunderbans is dying in front of our eyes due to Salina intrusion and impacts of climate change [Music] because the bay of bengal is slowly rising saltwater is getting into the freshwater channels of the Sundarbans and there's another environmental threat the government plans to build a coal-fired power plant in the region very totally and detailed study of that so that it will not how much to the environments and this is not so many actually two three four power plants that means we have planned within 2040 30% of the apartment will be from the coal but it will be a clean coal energy many are against the power plant which is a joint venture between public sector power agencies in Bangladesh and India India will build the plant located near rampa under the supervision of a German company once construction is completed India would also operate the facility UNESCO has asked the government to provide an environmental impact study on the project it is a completely a disastrous decision to build a coal-fired power plant so close to the forest and all environmental indications indicate that it will bring her disastrous consequences for the survival of the forest and in general for the environment we have in fact from save - under bonds committee produce 17 reports from various aspects that what will be the effect of Rampal coal plant on flora and fauna on the Schindler burns itself on the water the river erosion about the dredging problem and everything which shows very scientifically that it's definitely going to harm Schindler bonds India will supply the coal that the plant will burn the post Shore River is to be dredged nearby to make room for the transport ships environmental experts say the dredging operation will contribute to River erosion this is the pusher River about 90 kilometers above the point where it empties into the Bay of Bengal there are numerous fishing villages along the riverbanks the Christian minority in this village have put up a cross people have to walk carefully through the mud so they don't fall [Music] [Music] the main entrance to our old church was over there we built a new one but the river took it to 15 days ago I lost my house again to River erosion it was on this side where the poacher river is now my house was next to that church entrance the effects of climate change often hit the poorest of the poor the hardest swapna Kahn is raising a teenaged son and her husband is ill after the last flood a neighbor allowed her to build a small dwelling on his property she used materials from what was left of her house solar energy panels are common here in a village that has been ravaged by the effects of climate change my son sleeps back there and I sleep here in the front this is all we have swapna harvests river shrimp and sells them in the hut they sleep in her son attends a local school she wants him to have a better life I can't read or write so I don't have a lot of options I was born here and I don't want to live anywhere else I can earn a little money here just enough to get by swapna also owns a few sheep she calls them her life insurance policy she can sell the sheep to pay for her son's education but for now she's concerned about the river which is moving closer to her home swapna's elderly neighbor is also worried about the rising water I told my son that when I die he should put my body in the river because there's no land left to bury me [Music] we travel from the village of baan Gaeng cool to chilaka Punia the scenes of devastation are almost identical this is the grave of my grandfather the mourner bursar if we could find some land I could take the grave with me and rebuild it then roni besar climbs a coconut tree to get some of its fruit before the river washes those away too [Music] nothing here is safe from the rising water not even the graves of the dead [Music] a similar scene in the next village eight people live here the family of Shushan Tokumaru Mandar who earns a living as a fisherman his wife Roopa Bachar says they've had to rebuild their house three times a lot of our neighbors have gone to dhaka to work in the textile factories and there are fewer fish in the river shushant oh and his son fish in the Sundarbans just like his father before him now a Shonto fears that the coal-fired power plant will pollute the water here if we don't catch enough fish I'll have to take a job as a day laborer [Music] I can't move my entire family to the city alone ah shoulder [Music] from the Sundarbans we now move east to bola the largest island in Bangladesh [Music] fortified dykes were built along the Magna River after the last round of floods [Music] the dykes were built too late to help muhammad mustafa Maji his village was washed away by the river three years ago because he couldn't farm anymore he turned to fishing there was a mosque here a school and some houses but because of river erosion and flooding we had to move to another village Alisha more than a hectare of my land is under water here the village of Alisha is now protected by the Dyke but only a few of the 2,000 residents of muhammad's old village have been able to find a new home Mohammed says he was lucky because a local resident rented him some land and he built a new house there he lives here with his wife one of his three sons his daughter-in-law and a grandchild his son Abu Taher helps his father on the fishing boat the family can't grow their own vegetables anymore so they have to buy them this is Muhammad's daughter in law and his grandchild I've had to move three times because of River erosion if it happens again we'll all have to go to talk my two brothers already live there we had no money to pay for my younger brother's education [Music] 20 kilometers upstream we find another village ravaged by floodwaters the Dyke burst here four days ago it was the day of the Muslim feast of the sacrifice the river carried away everything we owned there was a cyclone and a lot of rain the wind flattened my home I still come to the river every day I was terrified and I can still feel it in my bones the river has taken everything I don't know how to survive this the farmer Mohammed new role Alam lives in the village of Dori rum pour we had a lot of fields scattered around the village almost a whole hectare of land only this rice field remains but the water no longer drains off the authorities have built a new dike here and a storm shelter but the shelter is dangerously close to the riverbank [Music] and the Dyke has cut off Muhammad's village from the rest of the region [Music] look at this rice the roots are rotting I have no idea what to do Allah help me and show me the way he Kabul the local residents fear that the Magna River will soon wash away everything this is what's left of Mohammed's house his young family and parents now sleep in temporary accommodations there's an old saying in Bangladesh water is the mother of our country but Muhammad believes that is no longer the case water used to mean life to me but now it means dancing is not new in the flat country Bangladesh it was once welcomed the rivers deposit alluvial soil throughout the Delta region and this creates some of the country's best farmland but now it is from 80s to 70s the huge changes is happening because of the monsoon season the zone of the cyclones because of the sea water rise and because of the high speed of the wheel you know the velocity of the Padma rebars pose it is 10 times higher than the German so speed of the water is very high dome alien cubic feet per second water speed then it is creating the river erosion although these people are a very innocent victim of the climate change because they are emitting only 3 kgs of carbon annually but compared to developed countries developed countries people emitting not less than 15 to 20 tonnes of carbon due to the sea-level rise which the beginning to happen and which should happen in a major way in Bangladesh beyond 2050 according to the IPCC's report Bangladesh will lose anything between 17 to 20 percent of his current landmass a 20% land loss to the sea due to sea level rise will cause at least 25 to 30 million people to be displaced within the country so we are going to create the largest refugee population due to climate change in one single country this school which has 2,000 pupils is threatened by the rising River even now [Music] the primary school has already been shut down the remaining rooms are now overcrowded but the loss of livelihoods of the population will be much larger we're talking about 20 to 30% of the population of the country that will be badly affected those living in the coastal areas in the low-lying coastal areas and eventually they will have to move so they are the potential future climate migrants and that clearly they are undoubtedly climate migrants these fortified cement blocks that make up the dike near the village of Alesia are being undermined by the river that flows past at least one of the blocks falls into the water every day the blocks aren't holding so this area will be flooded too it's dangerous for all of us hardly a day passes when Muhammad Mustafa Maajid does not see ships full of people headed for Dhaka [Music] every day there are more than 200 slums in Dhaka are receiving more and more what one might call environmental refugees or even climate change refugees coming from other parts of the country to Dhaka City [Music] [Music] Danka has now come to a size of 20 million people without the adequate infrastructure [Music] [Music] on the outskirts of the city factory waste and garbage laid on the streets salute een is mohamed mostafa ma geez 26 year old son he now lives in a slum that's located near the textile factory where he works the textile workers share this public bath if my parents land hadn't been flooded I'd still be in the village going to school we had to move three or four times because of flooding my parents finally ran out of money that's why I had to come to Dhaka first I worked in a shop but it didn't pay much that's why I switched to the textile factory so lutein his wife and child live in this small apartment life in the village was good I went to school and lived in my parents house I won't see that kind of life ever again there's no working bowler so I had to move here this is so low teens daily route to his job at the textile factory [Music] [Music] thousands of other climate refugees make a similar trip every day [Music] in front of the factory day laborers gather to see whether there's any work available for them that day [Music] people also wait outside the big companies around the corner to find out whether there are any jobs for them today [Music] [Applause] what do our machine I make the equivalent of about 125 euros a month I have to support my wife and child pay the rent and buy food I spent everything I had it's cheap labour the clothing that's made here is later sold in Western countries including Germany and France Muhammad's wife earns a little extra money at home by sewing clothes for the textile companies I get 5 cents per blouse my neighbor brings them over 1/4 of the money that my husband earns goes to pay the rent but if we get sick we have to borrow money from our families that's the only way that we can afford to see a doctor Sayeed is the boatman from bola Mohammad McGee's eldest son he sells mangoes on the streets of Dhaka here he's buying his fruit at a big wholesale market he was ill for three months and his debts piled up Saeed and a neighbor transport the mangoes in a bicycle cart and they share the cost of renting the vehicle Dhaka is filled with street vendors [Music] [Applause] many climate refugees live in miserable conditions there's garbage everywhere and open sewers nearby some people who came here from the island of bola have formed their own community they call it the bola slum the area is surrounded by high-rise buildings where white-collar workers live [Music] many of the slums residents work in those homes Syed's wife earns extra money by cleaning apartments we went hungry in bulla I had no choice but to move to Dhaka what else could I do our house was gone and the river kept flooding I didn't have much of a choice Sayid his wife and two children live in this cramped room so yet sister has also had to move to Dhaka my kids both go to school my wife and I can't read or write but we want the children to have an education I want to take my family back to Paulo there's no future for me and I'd like to build a house in the village and my kids could go to school an estimated one-third of daka's population live in slums the city's infrastructure is on the verge of collapse what would happen if up to 30 million more people moved to Dhaka over the next 20 years there would very likely be severe shortages of food and water and acha itself is at risk from the effects of climate change the city is situated on alluvial flatland and surrounded by lakes and rivers the climate refugees often build their shacks in areas that are flooded during the monsoon season there are no toilets and they have no clean drinking water since many of the refugees are living in illegal squatter settlements local officials arrive on a regular basis to evict them [Music] sometimes all the refugees can take with them is food mostly rice once again the refugees are driven from their homes not by floods this time but by the government if we are unable to completely manage this it can lead to conflict it will lead to destabilization it can lead to social conflict within country or within region or it can lead to in interstate conflict between states and countries so in all accounts and consequences this is of urgent need that we need to get a clear understanding of the whole issue of managing climate refugees and large numbers so that we have the mechanisms in place when it happens it seems as though we are already seeing the early stages of these conflicts why is the government doing this to us the authorities were bribed to do this there is no justice for the poor this government is just useless at 25 to 30 million displaced refugees will not only destabilize Bangladesh from within it will also destabilize the stability and the security of the region because it will result in large-scale trans boundary migration into the neighboring regions of the country that will cause serious destabilization on a regional scale [Music] we move on to the island of koutoubia on the bay of bengal along the coast of bangladesh the sea level is rising by up to 21 millimeters per year the world average is 3 millimeters the coastline is so flat that major floods can cause enormous damage you see the embankment has gone saline order including in the houses it is just four days ago the forces of the cadets is very strong government is constructing this embankment every year but it is unable to sustain result Kareem Chaudhary executive director of a coastal protection organization warns about potential health hazards people start getting the water drinking water which high level of ppb salinity so it's creating blood pressure high and creating a lot of diseases people are unprotected from that climate changes basically especially the coastal population which is around here not less than 40 million UNICEF supports Choudhary's organization which provides microcredits and other support for people who've been affected by flooding storms and other natural disasters Chaudhary believes that once the monsoon season starts the storms will destroy this family's home he points out that developed countries will not reach this year's Paris agreement targets for limiting global warming and reducing co2 emissions experts say that's a major cause for concern concretely it means that the whole world is in very great danger Bangladesh is only one part of that world Bangladesh is the first part of the world which will be inundated by sea level rise and affected by the impacts of climate change but every country in the world including Germany is going to affected sooner or later the best way to express this will be either we all sell together or we will all sing together Rizal Karim Chaudhary says the locals don't know that they are climate refugees so you became that climate refuses or Kapoor refuses but they don't know this they are considered that it is faith from the God

47,0,Drought and floods — the climate exodus | DW Documentary,"More people around the world are fleeing from climate change than from war. If human-induced climate change continues at the current rate, the World Bank warns that by 2050 there could be as many as 180 million climate refugees.The number of climate refugees is rising - and yet the status of ‘climate refugee’ has yet to be officially recognized by national or international law. One factor is illustrative of the devastating impact of climate change on countries and communities: water. Recent years have seen an increasing number of floods and droughts. A third of the global population lives near the coast, and an estimated 700 million people are facing rising sea levels. In the Philippines more than 85 percent of the population say they are feeling the impact of climate change in the rising frequency of flooding and violent typhoons. Farmers in the highlands of Guatemala, on the other hand, are suffering extreme drought. Both water scarcity and flooding are sparking mass migration. In response, rich countries such as the US are tightening their immigration policies. Yet lifestyles within industrialized nations are a major cause of climate change. Seven countries — including the US, China, Russia, India and Germany — are responsible for over 60 percent of global CO2 emissions. The US is the country with the highest emissions, yet it also has the most climate change deniers - notably President Donald Trump. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. He is also an advocate of fossil fuels and wants to build a wall to keep out migrants. Meanwhile, climate activist Greta Thunberg is fighting for change with her ‘Fridays for Future’ movement, and many others around the world are protesting in hopes of mitigating the impending climate catastrophe. Nonetheless, most people in affluent countries are unwilling to change their lifestyles. They are the ones who have a choice. For the countless thousands of climate refugees who are fleeing their homes, it is their very survival that is at stake.Every two seconds, a person is forced to flee their home. Today, more than 70 million people have been displaced worldwide. The DW documentary series ‘Displaced’ sheds light on the causes of this crisis and traces how wealthy industrialized countries are contributing to the exodus from the Global South.Tomatoes and greed – the exodus of Ghana's farmers: https://youtu.be/rlPZ0Bev99sOil and ruin — exodus from Venezuela: https://youtu.be/PjyX5dnhaMw--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Too much water — from\nstorms and flooding — is driving people\nfrom their homes. Elsewhere too little water is robbing\npeople of their livelihoods. All this could produce the largest\nwave of migration in human history. Up to a billion people may be displaced\nby climate change in this century. Initially, most will be poor\npeople in the global south — even as the wealthy north\nseals its borders. It’s true that we humans are\ncausing climate change. It’s real and\nit exists. People who deny it are\nlying to themselves. They can see and feel the effects\nof it in their surroundings; they can feel the effects\nof climate change. In the Philippines the future has\nalready arrived. Tropical storms, flooding and heavy rains are\nstriking at ever shorter intervals — and growing\nin intensity. Climate change is the worst creation\nto be produced by our species. We humans have created\nclimate change. And more and more people\nare on the run from it: If sea levels rise to the extent\nthat scientists have predicted, then by 2030, millions people on the coasts\nworldwide will be in acute danger. The densely populated coastal regions\nof Asia will be most affected. Binuangan is an island\ndistrict on the Bay of Manila. Here water is already\neating away at the land. Every year this community has been\nsinking four to six centimeters deeper into the sea. Residents have to rebuild their houses on\nthe rooftops of their old, sunken homes. What scares me the most about\nthis steady sea water rise is that someday we won’t\neven see the roofs anymore. Entire houses\nwill vanish. And at the same time we’ll keep trying to build up the\nground through land reclamation. George de Omaña —\nwho goes by Jojo — is captain of the\ncommunity’s rescue vessel. He has been homeless\nfor years now. Since the rising water\nmade his house unlivable, he has been sleeping\nat his workplace. Jojo doesn’t come\nhere much anymore. After the water began to destroy their\nhome, his wife took their son and left. At high tide, everything\nhere is submerged. The water was\nknee-deep here. We had to stow things in higher\nplaces to keep them safe. If the water\nreached the bed, we had to wait for it to\nsubside before we could sleep. This was a happy home. We usually had visitors\n— friends, relatives. We’d all be together inside this\nhouse, chatting, sharing meals, sometimes drinking. Now it’s makes me sad to think\nabout this house - abandoned. Jojo dreams of\nrestoring his house, but at the moment he\ndoesn’t have enough money. Many families have\nbeen torn apart. The young people move away to seek work.\nIn 2018 alone, an estimated 3.8 million\npeople in the Philippines fled from storms and\nnatural disasters. Worldwide most refugees are internally\ndisplaced in their own countries. In the end, everyone in Binuangan\nwill be driven out by climate change. The dead can no longer be buried here;\nthey have to be taken to the mainland. There are still 6,000 people\nliving here, in cramped quarters. Binuangan is sinking due to\nerosion and rising sea levels. I can see the extent of\nenvironmental destruction. The life of people in Binuangan is\nbound up with the water around us. Sea levels are rising worldwide as the\ntemperature of the atmosphere increases, causing ice at the\npoles to melt. That increase is due to the rise\nin greenhouse gas emissions — especially carbon\ndioxide, CO2. It is released when we burn coal, oil\nand gas in industry, heating and cars. The biggest CO2 emitters are\nthe big industrial nations — above all, China and\nthe United States. I’ve seen big changes here. Back when I was 15 or 20 years old\nthe rainy season was normal — in May, June, July. But now we get frost\nin those months. In the past we didn’t have those problems.\nI can feel the changes. The rainy season\nis coming later, and at the same time we\nkeep having cold snaps. In the summer we have long\nperiods without rain. We suffer from that — and then\nsuddenly we have too much rain. Pilar Jacinto Pablo grew up here\nin the highlands of Guatemala. She's grown potatoes all her life. But\nin recent years, things have changed. This little plant — as you can see\n— isn’t strong enough to survive. We can’t use it for seeds or\npotato production. It’s a loss. Every year, drought and frost\ndestroy many potato plants — which is all Pilar and her\nfamily grow on their fields. In Guatemala’s Western Highlands,\nmost people are small-scale farmers, and three quarters of\nthem live in poverty. During the rainy season from May to\nOctober, the countryside changes from dusty and dry, to lush and green.\nFor Pilar this would be the most\ntrouble-free part of the year — if only rainfall patterns\nwere like they used to be. Water is so important for\nus and the community because we have no natural water sources.\nWe depend on the rain for water. That’s why we buy containers and\ncanisters to catch the water. When the summer comes that’s the\nonly way to store a bit of water. It’s very important for our\ncommunities and our plantations. Without water we\ncan do nothing. Around half the residents of Todos\nSantos have gone to the United States. After every drought,\nmore and more leave. Most of the men are now\nworking in the US. Every month, they send\na few hundred dollars. Pilar’s house was built\nwith US dollars. The family also uses the money to pay the\ninstallments on a loan they took out to finance the trip and\nthe people smugglers. Like most here, Pilar and her family\nare Mam, an indigenous Mayan people. Pilar lives together with her\nchildren and grandchildren. Pilar’s husband emigrated\nthree years ago. They now make their decisions\ntogether over the phone. Without my husband’s help\nit would be very difficult. When our harvest fails,\nwe lose all our money. If my husband didn’t send\nmoney we wouldn’t get by. And it's not just this\none piece of land. We have more land where\nharvests have failed. Without his help we'd\nlose a lot of money. As an illegal immigrant, her husband could\nbe deported from the US at any time, so he doesn’t\nwant to be named. Pilar knows that migrants\nfrom Central America are no longer welcome\nin the United States. You know, it's really difficult\nwhen you think of Donald Trump, what he\nbelieves. He's so contradictory and in so\nmany different scenarios, right? You're going to build up this wall\nbut you're saying on Twitter: climate change\nis a hoax. As climate change exacerbates\nother things that are going on, it's definitely becoming either\na secondary or a primary reason why people\nare leaving. And their answer of course is this,\nright: Building up a border wall, building up what we see\nbefore us right now. There is still no legally\naccepted definition for terms such as “climate refugee” even though the World Bank predicts that\nMexico and Central America will have at least 1.4 million internal climate\nmigrants over the next 30 years — and many more who\nwill migrate abroad. The number of Guatemalans\nmigrants registered at the southwest US border has\nquintupled in the past three years. Todd Miller is an author who writes about\nsecurity policy and climate change. He’s been observing developments at\nthe US-Mexican border for years. If you go along the\n2,000-mile US-Mexico border there's about 650 miles of either\nwalls or barriers of some sort. There's all kinds\nof technologies, billions and billions of dollars in\ntechnologies, from high-tech cameras, cameras that can see seven miles\naway, radar systems, drones. There's a fleet of\napproximately ten drones. There's other things that you\nsee in US military operations. There's been a lot of\nthese kinds of transfers from conflict zones abroad to here. Now the United States has a new\nconflict zone on its own doorstep. It’s a crisis that the US and other\nindustrial nations have helped to create. There's seven hundred times more carbon\nemissions from the United States since 1900 than Guatemala, El\nSalvador, and Honduras combined — seven hundred times more. Yet this\nis the country that's fortifying its borders from people who\nare obviously impacted by those sorts of excessive\namounts of emissions and I think: How could that be possible?\nI mean, we've known about the science for so many years and\nwe had more than ever before. But at the same time there's more\nborder walls than ever before, too. Like this is a kind of adaptation plan\n— right? — for the richer countries. When David Ramos arrived\nin Arizona eight years ago there was no reception\ncenter for migrants. He’s still waiting for a\npermanent residence permit. I’ll always feel like a Guatemalan.\nI don’t feel American. That’s where I come from and\nI’ll only be here for a while. I don’t have a green card\nyet, but what can I do? No matter what, I’ll\nalways be Guatemalan. David has a work permit that has\nto be renewed every two years. Even if he were to be expelled, what\nhe's achieved here is something that many back home\ncan only dream of. And he earns enough to help\nsupport his family in Guatemala. He grew up there on his parents’\nfarm as one of nine children. I didn’t enjoy my childhood all that much.\nBut it was an ordinary childhood. We grew up working. My brothers worked\nwith my father, my sisters with my mother. Then I started to look for a way to earn a\nliving, and how I could continue my studies. So I got a job\nin a workshop. Here in the US he works\nas a freelance gardener. It’s very different\nfrom Guatemala. A lot grows in the hot season, even\nthough there’s hardly any water. Arizona has a desert climate\nand a severe lack of water. Life here is only possible thanks to water\npiped from the faraway Colorado River. But the cities of Phoenix and Tucson\nstill use the resource wastefully. They’re counted among the least\nsustainable cities in the world. Hundreds of thousands\nof liters of water go into keeping golf courses\nin the desert green. It’s a different life here. They have more ways of\ntreating the water. We don’t have that in Guatemala. I\ncan’t judge if that’s fair or unfair. Things are more\nadvanced here. When you look at their houses,\nthey’re not wasting water. They’re using it\nfor their plants. And since they have money, they can\npay for as much water as they want. David says someday he’d like\nto live like his clients — in his own house with a garden. To achieve that goal he\nworks six days a week. Beautiful,\nthank you! Thank you so much,\nhave a nice day! Have a good\nweekend! Thank\nyou. He just earned 65 dollars cash,\nfor an hour of gardening. David married a Guatemalan\nwoman in the US. She comes from the same\nhighland region as he does. He lives here in a trailer park\nwith his wife and daughter. On Sundays David likes to drive out into\nthe desert. The hills remind him of home. He’d like to go back to Guatemala\nsomeday to see his family, but without a Green Card he\nwouldn’t be able to reenter the US. It makes me sad. It’s tough to\nbe separated from your family. They’re over there and only I’m here.\nBut what can you do? We’re separated, not because we want to be, but because\nwe are forced to be by necessity. Over there, you can’t\nmake ends meet. I'll never leave here. As\nlong as this world remains, Binuangan will\nremain Binuangan. Conditions in the ocean are changing; the\nfishermen are catching less and less. They can hardly earn\na profit nowadays. Almost every family has at least\none member who has left Binuangan. It’s true that people\nare leaving here. They’ve gone to work\noverseas — or in Manila. As far as I can tell, the water level\nhere in Binuangan will continue to rise. But we’ll continue to build it up,\nto reclaim our beloved neighborhood. The people of Binuangan won’t let\nthis place vanish beneath the waves. Not everyone here believes that\nthe community can be saved. Every day, Jojo’s neighbor\nMelody finds her house flooded. I dream of settling in\nanother place, not here. But my husband, Jay, is from here\nand he doesn’t want to leave. I’m originally from the\nmainland, from Navotas. But Jay comes from here and\nhe won't leave this place. There are plenty\nof indications. First, the warnings on the\nradio, and on the television. When a strong typhoon is approaching\nwe start tying down the roofs. We tie them down so they won't\nbe blown away by the wind. And we usually buy supplies before the\nstorm so that we have something to eat, the basics, while the storm\nsweeps through the village. From typhoons\nto storms, extreme weather has grown more\nfrequent in recent years. Scientists still don’t know\nto what extent this rise is connected to human-induced\nclimate change. Any place you look at that's\nsupposedly a victim of climate change— no they're a victim of lack of freedom.\nThey have very little capability. And so yeah, everything sucks\nincluding the climate sucks, but it's not because\nwe put more CO2 in it, it is just because life sucks\nwhen you're a human being on a difficult planet\nwith very low capability. For example, if you look at the US, we\nhave every form of climate imaginable. We have a polar\nclimate in Alaska. We have like swampy Florida or\nwe have California where I live which I think is the\nnicest climate. But we all have life\nexpectancies over 75. Why? Because when human beings are\nsufficiently capable they can adapt to and even master any climate versus\nwhen they have very low capability when they're in primitive and poor\nsocieties they can't deal with anything. So I think one of the big things that's\nmisplaced in the climate discussion, is there's not enough focus on how\ndo we increase human capability. I'm an energy philosopher, which means\nI try to help people think more clearly about energy and\nenvironmental issues. Alex Epstein is widely known\nas a climate change skeptic. At least 13 percent of Americans\nshare his views on global warming — a higher proportion than in\nany other western country. Epstein advises oil companies on how\nto sell their products better — also using climate\ndenial arguments. People have a very deep-seated fear of\nchanging our environment. And I think that causes them when we change our\nenvironment through fossil fuels, through say having a warming\ninfluence on climate, I think people tend to exaggerate\nand get overly fearful, versus looking at\nit proportionally. Since the 19th century the\nUS has burned more coal, oil and natural gas\nthan any other country. The current administration has refused to\ntake responsibility for that — and in 2019 officially gave notice\nthat the US is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. That’s bad news for the\ncountries in the global south. They’re already are the ones most\naffected by climate change — and are least able to\ndeal with the impact. I think it's been great for\nus to have a lot of energy but also it's been amazingly positive\nfor the poorer parts of the world that we've used\nall this energy. So what's happened is we've been\nspending decades and decades and decades thinking about how to improve life\nincluding things like medical discoveries that have then been shared in large part\nwith the poorer parts of the world. So there's a certain narrative that\nwe've made people's lives worse but no, the wealthy world has made in so far as\nthey've created all of this innovation has made everyone's\nlives better. So I don't think we should\nfeel guilty about it. And I think we should be very proud. I think that humanity — there are a lot of\nproblems, but life has never been better and the earth has never been\na better place to live. And I think most people if they\nthink about it would agree. I don't think they would want to go\nback to 50 years ago or 100 years ago. In the Arizona desert, scientists at\nthe Biosphere 2 experimental station are trying to find out how to model and\nperhaps save the Earth’s major ecosystems. Biosphere started out as the world's largest\necological experiment ever conducted with a closed or controlled\nenvironment to try to replicate Earth's systems and to\nbetter understand it. The earth is\ntruly unique and we know that that uniqueness is\nwhat allows us to live and survive. And if those conditions\nchange so much so it could definitely threaten\nor it will threaten our survival. And so I think understanding what\nthose potential implications are before they actually\nplay out are crucial. The research center houses\nseven model ecosystems. It’s a unique place where, under\nclose-to-real-world conditions, it is possible to test\nhow natural systems will respond to extreme\nenvironmental change. The researchers can control the climate\nand measure how the ecosystem reacts. In the model rainforest an\ninternational team of scientists are studying what happens\nwhen there is less rain. The unique thing here is that in the\nBiosphere we can control the entire forest. We can decide when it will rain,\nand how much. We’re measuring how the\ntropical rainforest responds when it is still in\nits normal state. And then we’re going to initiate a long\ndrought and see how the ecosystem behaves. Once it gets drier, the\nrate of photosynthesis — goes down. We want to know at what point a\nsystem like this reaches its limits. It's important to know what will happen\nin the world’s forests in the future. Trees store CO2, the climate gas that\ncauses this atmospheric warming, which arises from the combustion\nof fossil substances. Plants take it up\nduring photosynthesis. What we see around the world\nis that up to 30 percent of the emissions that we put into the\natmosphere can be taken up again by forests. So they act as a huge buffer that\nhelps mitigate the climate effect. Without them, it\nwould be much worse. Scientists first warned about\nglobal warming decades ago — but it took years for the message\nto even begin to sink in. Today it’s apparent\nthat the climate is changing faster than\nscientists had predicted. But at the end of the day we\nare all inhabitants of Earth. And so what happens here in the\nUS or what happens in Europe or Asia at some point is\ngoing to impact all of us. So I think it behooves all of us to\nrecognize that we are seeing changes, that those changes have impacts\non ecosystems, on resources and that we are dependent on\nthose systems for our existence. And so, again, if they change so\ndramatically it is going to impact us and potentially, if we're not able\nto adapt, we will no longer survive. Pilar is seeking help to defy the extreme\nweather. Her potatoes are her livelihood. Now she’s lost not only a\nlarge part of the harvest, but has too few seed tubers\nfor planting next year. A seed bank helps\nfarmers like Pilar 53 domestic potato varieties\ngrow on the fields here. The seed bank gives\nPilar tubers. In return she will have to give\nup some of her next harvest. A farming cooperative collects and\nstores seeds from local crops. That way local growers can obtain seeds if\nneed be — so when the next drought hits, they’re less likely to have to\ngive up their farms and leave. In some villages here, half the\npopulation has already gone to the US. ‘Vecinos fantasmas‘\n- ghost neighbors — is what the owners of these\nunoccupied houses are called. They live in the US but send money home to\nbuild their American-style dream-houses. For when\nthey return. The cemetery in Todos Santos Cuchumatán\nalso has tales of migration to tell. American flags decorate the graves of\nthose who died as immigrants in the US When her husband left three years ago, he\nand Pilar made that decision together. They knew they would not see\neach other for many years. I know that he's far from home\nand we’re a long distance apart. But I also know that we did it\nbecause things are very hard here. And I know in my heart that this\ndistance will not ruin our relationship. I know my husband\nwill come back. Scientists agree that climate\nchange can no longer be stopped. But its magnitude\nwill depend on whether people are prepared to\nradically alter their lifestyles. As I drive myself, and I see all the\ncars that are going back and forth and three lanes of traffic,\nfour lanes of traffic. And I think as a person that's aware\nof the climate crisis and you think ‘oh is there any progress being\nmade’ and all I have to do is go out on the main\navenues and think no. I don't know, if I turn\non the television, I don't know how many times\nI'm told to buy a car. You know on one hand\nthere's a climate crisis. On the other hand I'm always been told to\nbuy the new car, a new car, a new car. I mean, as you look around the\nworld, it's all adding up. The stresses put upon\npeople are worse and worse. I think what the world\nneeds to be looking at is we're going to have\npeople on the move. This is there is something set in\nmotion that cannot be stopped. There are going to be places\nthat can no longer be lived in. And now this idea of a more bordered\nworld is an idea of exclusion where certain people have\naccess and others do not. And we have to instead\nstart thinking of a world where there's going to be a lot of\npeople on the move, and how can we begin to understand that and\nmaybe begin to at least forge a sort of new world where those\npeople will be more welcomed. I sometime dream of the\nFlood, the Deluge. Because of people’s stubbornness,\nbecause they did not obey God’s laws. He punished the\nwhole world. Then God promised that he would\nnot do the same thing again. But look at what’s happening now.\nIt’s happening slowly, in different places. It’s the\nsame scenario, all over again. Jojo might soon find\nhimself a climate migrant. If sea levels keep rising,\nnot just his home but the entire island\ndistrict could be submerged. How long that might\ntake nobody knows. I don’t like what’s happening,\nespecially for the coming generations. I pity those children who will grow up without\nexperiencing the beauty of this place. If we continue on this path, we won’t be\nable to do anything about climate change. In the highlands of Guatemala the\ndescendants of the Maya believe that the global climate is out of\nkilter because humans have lost their respect\nfor Mother Earth. It depends on us. If we conserve water and care for the\ntrees, we’ll have a chance of surviving. But if we continue like we are\ndoing now and cut down the trees, the future for our children\nwill be very hard. Thank God we still have water\nand trees and can survive. But if we continue to destroy\nnature and the Earth, in the future people will have\nnothing left to drink and to eat.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,0,Hürtgen forest and the end of World War II | Free Full DW Documentary,"Thousands of soldiers were killed in the last battles of World War II. US troops who fought in the Hürtgen Forest nicknamed it the """"Death Factory."""" This documentary features original film from US archives that bring the battle back to life.It's estimated that as many as 30 thousand US and German soldiers were killed in fighting in the northern Eifel region of Germany in the autumn and winter of 1944 and 1945. Traces of the battle - old bunkers, munitions, trenches and tank tracks - are still visible even today. The scarred landscape bears witness to a little-known chapter of World War Two. The """"Hürtgen Forest"""" was the last obstacle standing between US forces and the Rhine River and Ruhr. Yet the decision to advance into the thick forest in September 1944 proved to be a fatal mistake. The Americans completely miscalculated North Eifel region's rugged terrain. They became disoriented in an area the German forces, the Wehrmacht, had crisscrossed with trenches and peppered with anti-personnel mines, making the wood into a veritable fortress. Continual rain and fog, followed by snow and frigid temperatures, turned the battle into a scene of dystopian butchery. Author Ernest Hemingway spent 18 days on the front in the Hürtgen Forest. He wrote later, """"It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there."""" This documentary reconstructs the stages of the battle using commentary from survivors of the clash. Among them are the well-known US photographer Tony Vaccaro, US Army veteran James K. Cullen and former Wehrmacht soldier Paul Verbeek. In addition, Hürtgen Forest residents tell of the legacy of the battle, including the threat posed by countless unexploded munitions left in the ground 75 years after the conflict in Europe ended.",DW Documentary,tT0ob3cHPmE,"['A tranquil forest in the Eifel\nregion of western Germany ... a forest that\nharbors a dark past, ... with a legacy still\nvisible in isolated places ... from a time when it\nwas dubbed a “Green hell”. In the closing stages of\nthe Second World War, it was the scene of bloody fighting\nbetween US and German forces. The path to the western Allies’\nadvance from Belgium into Germany led straight through the forest\naround the village of Hürtgen. For local people, the battle is\nstill a key part of their history. I really came into contact with\nthe history of the Hürtgen forest when I rode around here\non my bike as a teenager. I’d suddenly come across ruins\namong the trees — massive concrete walls. When I asked my parents, they told\nme they were the remains of bunkers from the Second\nWorld War. And once you know what to\nlook for in this wartime landscape, you can also see bomb\ncraters, trenches and foxholes. If you really take the time, you can\nfind a lot of these World War Two relics in the\nHürtgen forest. For around five months the\nforest was the scene of successive, bitterly fought battles between\nthe American and German armies. Although the Americans had more\ntroops and were better equipped, their attempt to drive the Germans\nout of the forest was a military disaster. Progress was slow and costly as they became\nbogged down in the treacherous terrain. It was a nightmare. I don’t think\nthere can be a worse hell. It was awful. It was freezing, and these damn\nshells, they hit the top of the tree and came down in\nthousands of fragments. They could\nkill anybody. I was in combat there for ten\ndays, at the height of the battle. I was trembling for\npractically the entire ten days. I knew I could die, of\ncourse, and I was terrified. An estimated 25,000 American and\nGerman soldiers died in the forest. To survive Hurtgen Forest was a miracle.\nBut here I am. I don\'t know how I survived. The forest was a death\ntrap for the US troops. They called it “Hürtgen Forest” after the small\nvillage that was at the heart of the fighting. The Battle in the Hürtgenwald was\none of the longest and deadliest battles on German\nsoil in the West. It left a lot of scars, not only on the\ninhabitants and their descendants, but also on the landscape itself, in\nthe forest and also on local buildings. For the German troops, the\nwar was in effect already long lost. Even the young soldiers — those who\ncould reflect - did not believe in victory. You just wanted to survive,\nto come home safe and sound. Nazi war propaganda, however,\nportrayed a completely different picture: By then everyone knew\nthe Allies would win the war. Everything that happened\nin the Hürtgenwald meant just a minimal\ndelay of the inevitable. And it indirectly contributed to\nthe continuation of the murders in the concentration and extermination\ncamps and in the prisons and other places, until the very last\nsecond of the Third Reich. Since D-Day in June 1944,\nthe Western Allied troops had been advancing from Normandy through\nFrance and Belgium towards Germany ... ... in the process liberating Paris,\nBrussels and Antwerp from Nazi occupation. We were told\nto, or ordered to, take the ground that they were\non and take it away from them, and that’s how we\nadvanced to win the war. We’re the ones that\ngonna win, not them. On September\n11, 1944, the first US divisions reached the\nBelgian-German border near Aachen ... ... more than 3 months\nearlier than expected. One day later, the 3rd US Armored Division\ncrossed into Germany near the town of Roetgen. We just went through the\ntown, and went on the other side. Then we got into the real trouble\nwith the first sight of the Siegfried Line. The Siegfried Line was the defensive wall\nbuilt to secure Germany’s western border. We saw steel gates on the\nroad and Dragon\'s Teeth. And that was the first Dragon\'s\nTeeth that we had seen. Anti-tank obstacles known as “dragon\'s\nteeth” accompanied a line of bunkers stretching over 600 kilometers from\nthe Dutch border down to Switzerland. For western Allied troops,\na formidable obstacle. They had no precise idea what\nto expect at the Siegfried Line. So the closer they got to the\nactual territory of the Third Reich, the more insecure they became,\nbecause they thought they would still face strongly fortified and heavily\nmanned defensive positions. The Allies had been taken in by the\nNazi propaganda of the pre-war years. This went so far that the\nAmerican military’s films, used excerpts from\nGerman propaganda films showing the Siegfried Line\nas an insurmountable obstacle. to explain to its troops\nwhat they were up against. As many as half a million men\nworked as much as 20 hours a day to build 22,000 fortified\npositions on land. We knew that the Germans\nhad built the Siegfried Line and that they were hoping that that\nwould stop us, but it didn\'t happen. Because we broke\nthrough the Siegfried Line, we took a hell of a lot of\ncasualties, but we did it. But we knew that the Siegfried\nLine was a bad place to go to. Psychologically, the Siegfried\nLine was effective on both sides, but its military value in the\nactual fighting was very limited. US troops succeeded in breaking through\nthe anti-tank barriers near Roetgen. But on the other side they met with\nstubborn resistance from German troops who were firmly dug in - in\nthe bunkers and in the woods. James Cullen was wounded in\nthe fighting near the village of Rott. Oh (expletive)! I got hit. I got hit.\nAnd, it was a tremendous blow. And I looked down and I saw the blood\npouring out right where my heart was. And I said: God, am I I gonna\ndie here on a lousy German field? Because it\nlooked deadly. A few weeks later, Cullen’s\nparents back home received the news that their son had been wounded\nin action after being hit by shrapnel. He was away from\nactive duty for two months. With American troops progressing\nmuch faster than expected, supply lines were stretched, which in\nparticular meant fuel shortages for tanks. The advance ground to a halt\njust behind the German border. That gave German forces time\nto rebuild their lines of defense. Until then, the Wehrmacht had only stationed\nisolated units in the northern Eifel. Meanwhile, preparations were underway\nfor the “Volkssturm” — old men and boys, the “home guard” for\nGermany’s last-ditch defense. In a televised\naddress, propaganda minister Josef Goebbels\ncalled on his compatriots’ determination. As usual Goebbels\nwas lying, of course. He claimed that the enemy was not\nyet on German soil, although they were, and tried to mobilize\nany remaining forces. It has to be said that the German population\nwere all too happy to go along with that. They were tired of war\nand wanted it to be over. But they were also terrified of what\nthe Allies would do to them if they came. The Americans wanted to advance further\ninto Germany and finally see the war ended. Their aim was to reach the Rhine\nand then the Ruhr industrial region. But ahead of them lay a dense forest,\nalmost 10km wide, which blocked their path: The\nHürtgenwald. In local villages, the war had been\nall too present for several months, especially due to the Allied\nair raids on cities like Aachen. The civilians sought\nrefuge in air-raid shelters. There were constant air raid alerts,\nand one day we came out of the bunker and six buildings had\nburned down in the night. The cattle were screaming, the pigs\nwere screaming, the people were screaming. It was\nawful. In September\n1944, the villages were evacuated as the invading\ntroops and the front line came ever closer. One morning our parents\nsaid: We have to leave. The artillery shells\nwere landing all around. We were the last\nones left in Harscheidt. My parents said: This is too\nmuch, we’re going to leavse too. Instead of going around\nthe forest to the north, the American commanders decided to\nadvance eastward right through the middle, where they hoped German\ndefenses would be weak. But they completely misjudged the\nterrain — with disastrous consequences. A first push in October\n1944 ended after just 3km. It\'s not as if forests\nare alien to Americans. It\'s always highly problematic for\nan army to fight in wooded terrain. Tanks can\'t just drive through\nforests and over large trees. First you have to cut\npaths through them. The ground was also\nlittered with land mines, and the Americans ran into a\nchain of bunkers in the forest. This was where the Germans\nhad dug themselves in. The Americans managed to\ndestroy some of the bunkers ... But after ten days, the losses\non both sides were so great that the fighting\ndied down for a while. Shortly afterwards, American forces further\nnorth achieved a decisive breakthrough, taking Aachen on October\n21st after fierce fighting. It was the first German\ncity to fall into Allied hands. But this was of little help to the American\nsoldiers in the nearby Hürtgenwald. As the autumn rains began, the weather\nwas worsening from one day to the next. The US troops were\nliterally bogged down. Plans for a second advance\nhad to be repeatedly delayed. As one GI\nlater said: Anyone who says he knows\nwhere he’d been in the forest is lying... On November 2, the Americans\nattacked the village of Vossenack, from there they took the villages of\nKommerscheidt and Schmidt via the Kall valley. But once again they\nunderestimated the difficult terrain. Some of the hills they had\nto cross were 150m high. When you reach\nthe top of a hill, you immediately experience the\nphenomenon of looking over the landscape, from one plateau\nto another. But you have no idea how deep\nand steep the valleys in-between are. The 28th US Infantry Division reached\nthe village of Schmidt relatively quickly. But then its supply\nlines were interrupted. If you look at Vossenack and\nSchmidt, with the valley in between, the only link between them is a\nfootpath that winds down into the valley and then up again\non the other side. The Americans thought this path would\nbe easy enough to drive and walk along, and that they’d be able to move\nthe necessary troops, vehicles, heavy weapons and\nother supplies along it. Everything. But\nthat was nonsense. The remains of tank\ntracks are a stark reminder that the battle for Vossenack and Schmidt\nended in disaster for the Americans. The invaders retreated in panic, only for\nGerman units to cut them off in the valley. Tanks crashed down the slopes and\nmany soldiers collapsed from exhaustion. The battle in\nthe Kall Valley, which the Americans subsequently\nreferred to as Death Valley, claimed countless\nlives on both sides. A few days after the defeat, General Dwight\nD. Eisenhower came to the Hürtgenwald to meet his troops on the\nground and assess the situation. Neither the Allied Supreme\nCommander, nor his officers, had expected so\nmany casualties. The mood was\ndespondent. Autumn 1944 remained unusually wet and cold,\nthe terrain became more impassable every day. The Americans\' hopes for\na quick victory were fading. They had already spent two\nmonths in the Hürtgenwald, the forest they had hoped\nto cross in just a few days. In mid-November 1944, the\nAmericans launched a third offensive. This time they tried to\nadvance by going further north, passing through the villages of Kleinhau\nand Großhau, and then heading east. A 22-year-old Italian-American from\nPennsylvania arrived in the Hürtgenwald. In his youth he’d hoped\nto become a photographer. We were there, I would say a\nmonth. A month in war is a long time. The German artillery was in... it just\nnever stopped. They really bombed us. The days followed the same pattern. It began\nwith heavy artillery fire from the Americans ... Then tanks were deployed, Sherman\ntanks, which advanced on a broad front. And then of course you could\nhear the shells and machine guns. That was the actual\nmoment you realized there were other people\nnearby who were shooting at you. Paul Verbeek was sent to the Hürtgenwald\nwith other young recruits in mid-December to lay anti-tank\nmines. The US forces were constantly\ngetting reinforced with more men, and more vehicles\nand equipment. But they were not prepared for the\nextreme weather conditions in the Eifel. Whenever they got stuck\nin the forest, they dug in. But foxholes offered little\nprotection against the German artillery and the cold\nonset of winter. It would rain sometime,\nor the snow would melt, and the fox hole was\nalways filled with water. I was fortunate to have this camera\nwith me. And if you look at my pictures: I have hundreds and\nhundreds of pictures of officers. I didn\'t take those because I liked\nit, I took them to make them happy, so that they would give me freedom\nto take more pictures, you know. I tricked all of them, I\nused them like little boys. Both the Germans and the\nAmericans spent most of their nights in their foxholes\nin the woods, poorly protected from the cold and\nwet with makeshift tarpaulin shelters. I transformed the nature\naround me into a dark room. I would ask three of my best friends to\nlet me use the metal part of the helmet and those became the trays\nfor my darkroom at night. I would mix my chemicals,\nmost GIs were all asleep, I was working because the\ndark room was only the night, the earth was the\ndark room, you see. Tony Vaccaro took hundreds\nof photos in the Hürtgenwald, although he waited over 50 years\nbefore publishing a selection of them. All I wanted to take was take\nphotographs, photographs, photographs. And that\'s why I am here today, otherwise\nI would have gotten killed a long time ago. Some of the fiercest fighting took\nplace in a valley west of Kleinhau, in the heart\nof the forest. In mid-November, author Ernest Hemingway\nwas witness to the bloody battles there. In his novel “Across the River and into the\nTrees”, based on his experiences, he wrote: “It was a place where it was extremely\ndifficult for a man to stay alive, even if all he did\nwas be there.“ In December, Tony Vaccaro also photographed\nhis comrades preparing for Christmas season. Gift parcels with canned food from home\narrived for soldiers long since perished. They began to give this food of those\nGIs to the local people, to the Germans. On December 16, 1944, a hundred\nmiles further south in the Ardennes, the Germans launched\na final surprise offensive. Once again the Allies were hard-pressed\nin this likewise heavily forested region, and had to bring in reinforcements at\nshort notice to stem the German advance — many from the\nHürtgenwald. Even during the Battle of the\nBulge there was fighting here, but both the Wehrmacht and the Allies were\nso busy with the offensive further south that there was a period of two or\nthree weeks without any major combat. Then the war returned\nto Hürtgenwald. In the course\nof January 1945, the Americans managed to advance in\nthe face of weakening German resistance. The defeat in the Ardennes counter-offensive\nhad cost the defenders their last reserves. I particularly remember the first time I\nsaw the Americans as prisoners of war, I was amazed at how\nwell fed they were. And they were clean and\ntidy, including their uniforms, while we were a\nlice-ridden, dirty rabble. Once the Americans reached the Rur —\nnot to be confused with the more famous, similar-sounding\nvalley further north — their way to the Rhine and\nCologne was finally clear. The Germans tried to blow up the dams to\nflood the valley and halt the US advance. But by now the end of the war\nseemed to be fast approaching. In February 1945, US troops liberated\nSoviet prisoners of war and forced laborers in the Arnoldsweiler\nconcentration camp near Düren. Many were also held in inhuman conditions\nat a second camp near Hürtgenwald. Over 2,000 inmates were later buried\nat the Soviet war cemetery in Simmerath. Most of them had died of\nhunger and maltreatment. Most of the towns and\nvillages in the Hürtgenwald were barely recognizable\nafter the fighting. The Allied troops pushed on, and within\na few weeks had conquered the Rhineland and the industrial Ruhr Valley\nas they advanced towards Berlin. The evacuated residents now hoped\nto be able to return to their villages. When the Americans passed through,\none of them asked us where we were from. We said we were\nfrom Schmidt. He said he had fought there,\nand that we shouldn\'t go back there because the whole place was in\nruins and the village had been mined. But we said:\n""We\'re going home.” The fighting in the\nHürtgen Forest was over. But the war had left\na trail of destruction: a ravaged landscape whose\nscars are still clearly visible today. First, American soldiers cleared the\nmines that were buried everywhere. German prisoners of war\nwere also forced to help them. But they could only remove only a\nsmall number of the deadly devices. Again and again we’d hear this huge bang,\nand another person flew through the air. So many people\nlost their lives. One little girl had been playing with a hand\ngrenade. She thought it had perfume inside. The hand grenades had rings on\nthem, and when you pulled them, you had to throw\nthem away quickly. The girl’s hand\nwas blown off. A very central aspect of the post-war\nexperiences of people living in the Eifel was that they actually had to rebuild\ntheir lives on a former battlefield. Children died because\nthey played with munitions. It was dangerous to plough\nand cultivate the fields. It took decades to clear the most severely\naffected parts of the forest of ordnance, debris and the dead\nwho had been left there. It would take the forest\ndecades to recover. At the same time, nearby towns\nhad been destroyed by air raids. In September 1945, August\nScholl returned home from the war. After being demobbed, me\nand another guy arrived in Düren on a freight train from Bonn\nat the beginning of September. We looked at each other and I\nsaid: “Martin, is this actually Düren?” “Sure,” he said,\n“there’s the signpost!” It was a bit lop-sided,\nbut it said “Düren”. And then we looked across the\nold town, it was one big pile of rubble. You couldn\'t see a single\nbuilding still standing, and the really depressing\nthing was this eerie silence. He continued to his home\nvillage of Großhau on foot. It had been almost completely\ndestroyed during the fighting. The locals resorted to scavenging\namongst the wrecked American tanks. The Americans had left\nbehind lots of canned food. Canned corned beef was\none of the main meats. There were also soups and other kinds\nof meat, but these tins of corned beef were big enough to make a\nhuge pot of soup for a large family. So temporarily, they helped us\nto get more or less enough to eat. In the first summer\nafter the war, large parts of the woods that had survived\nthe fighting would suddenly catch fire. During the fighting, the Americans\nhad used phosphorus in their ammunition, which ignited very\neasily in the heat. The locals repeatedly found the\nbodies of dead soldiers in the forest. Some I\nburied myself. And I don\'t need to explain what\nhalf-rotten dead people look like. You have to take a deep breath — mentally,\ntoo — when you do something like that. The first war cemetery in the area was built\nin Vossenack several years after the war. Many of the dead were recovered by\nformer Germany army captain Julius Erasmus, who dedicated the rest of his life to\nsearching the forest for fallen soldiers. The war cemetery in Vossenack became the last\nresting place for around 2,300 dead soldiers, and a meeting place for veterans\nand relatives of the German fallen. Another war cemetery was set up a few\nkm away in neighboring Hürtgen in 1952. Nearly 3,000 soldiers are buried\nthere, many of them in unmarked graves. Since the Americans didn\'t want soldiers\nburied in Germany, the former enemy, many were laid to rest in the\nNetherlands, Luxembourg or Belgium — at the military cemetery of\nHenri-Chapelle, for example. It was not until four\ndecades after the battle that the first groups of American\nveterans returned to the Hürtgenwald - to the place where they\nhad fought as young men. You can understand why it became the\nmurky - as they call it - Hürtgen Forest. The whole battle itself, like the\nman said this morning, it was futile, it was foolish, but the fact remains\nthat it was done to satisfy the whims of a few superior officers\nthat thought it had to be done. Well, I didn\'t\nenjoy it at the time. I don\'t mind being here now because\nnone of you fellows are wearing uniforms. So it\'s ok as far as that\'s\nconcerned. But it was pretty difficult. The commemorative events sometimes brought\ntogether American and German veterans: former\nenemies. The battle also left its\nlegacy in the forest itself. Over the\nsubsequent years, bomb disposal experts have frequently\nbeen called in to remove bombs, hand grenades\nand other ordnance. The dangers here will continue to affect\nfuture generations of people in the region. Even now, 75\nyears after the battle, the war is still present in the\nground of the Hurtgen Forest. This is an area that has\nobviously not been searched, like so many areas\nin the Hürtgenwald. Here you might still unearth a\ngrenade by scratching away the topsoil. Sometimes these things\ndon\'t look like munitions at all. For example, there’s a German grenade that\nlooks like a cigar, it’s about the same size. But if it goes off,\nyou’re gone. In the first decades\nafter the war, hundreds of tons of ordnance\nwere found in the forest every year. This footage from 1984 shows the\nyield of a search lasting two weeks. You have to imagine that here, by\nnoon in a single day, in a single attack, the Americans fired\nabout 12,000 grenades. 12,000 — not 1,200. Given the typical\nassumption that 15% of these are duds, then we have to assume there are about\n1,500 duds in an area of 3.5-4 hectares. For a number\nof years now, researchers have been studying the Hürtgenwald\nusing the latest scientific methods. They’ve been able to\nreconstruct the course of the battle in places where this\nwasn’t previously possible. When you walk\nthrough the woods here, you encounter signs of\nthe battle at every turn. In all the open spaces, however, the former\nbattlefield has been completely cleared. In other words, we always see half of\nthe battlefield. And we can see that here. We are standing in what appears\nto be a completely level green field, with nothing to indicate that\nwe’re on a former battlefield. But in fact, we’re in the middle\nof a highly fortified section of the Germans’\nsecond line of defense. Many local people have kept\nthe memory of the battle alive. In addition to\nthe German dead, thousands of Americans who had been sent\nto Europe to end Nazi terror perished here. Although this is by no\nmeans clear everywhere. Take the memorial stones for American\nor German soldiers, for example. The way they are treated on equal\nterms is actually quite questionable. It ought to be made clear that\nthe Americans were fighting for something very different\nthan the German soldiers. But you’ll find them dotted around\nthe landscape without any comment. The forest is still frequented by people\nforaging around for relics of the battle. Even today the area is a popular\nsite among war enthusiasts. But many locals are annoyed by these\ngroups of individuals in American uniforms, repeatedly re-enacting\nscenes from the battle. It\'s kind of like replaying the war.\nSome people even dig new trenches here. So they don\'t leave this\ncommemorative landscape as it was. Of course, they don\'t shoot at\neach other with live ammunition, but people still\nfind it fascinating. I take a critical view, because\nthere were so many fatalities here. Whether it\'s fun or\nnot is beside the point. Today there are now signs for\nwalkers and hikers in various places, telling the story of the\nBattle of the Hürtgen Forest. They also remind us of its\nimportance for the Western allies\' advance through Germany. But the Hürtgenwald will probably\nnever be a normal forest again. Certainly not now, some\n75 years after the battle. I went back to Hurtgen\nForest maybe ten years ago. I cried like a baby because I\nsuddenly remembered my best friends that got killed in\nthe Hurtgen Forest. It was ugly, ugly for\nmankind to have wars. The trouble mankind makes is he thinks\nhe\'s Italian, he\'s German, he\'s Spanish. We\'re all humans on this beautiful,\nparadise that is our earth. Beautiful!']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,0,Bosnia and Herzegovina: an ethnically divided country | DW Documentary,"Ethnic divides still exist in some neighborhoods in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a school in Travnik, a fence separates Muslim and Croat pupils.Due to a high volume of comments that are not in accordance with our netiquette policy, the comment section for this video has been disabled. For more information, click the following link: https://www.dw.com/en/dws-netiquette-...Amela is a Muslim. She went to school in Travnik and grew up with this ethnic segregation. Bosnia’s constitutional court declared the """"two schools under one roof policy"""" unconstitutional in 2012. But this policy is still practiced in everyday life, even though nobody calls it that anymore. It’s not just in schools that the distance between the ethnic groups is visible. The parents also foster ethnic segregation from their neighbors. It’s always been this way - Amela will of course marry a Muslim. The country is home to Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs. They say they live together but on closer inspection they just live side by side. Very few would accept a spouse from a different ethnic group._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

has to work six days a week the average wage in Bosnia is 400 euros a month but few people in travnik earn that much she says amela says we should visit the military cemetery behind the market while she does her shopping [Music] the headstones there all tell the same story the dead were all in their mid-twenties when they died four hundred and seventy eight of them are buried in this cemetery alone war veterans meet here regularly this is neverold in smudge he's a 41 year old Muslim who lost almost all of his friends in the war he was just 16 when he joined the Bosnia forces we were still untouched somewhat with our neighbors during the war we met up when there was no fighting we drank coffee and then we all picked up our guns and took sides again the war wasn't about ordinary people it was for the politicians this Muslim man married a Serbian Orthodox woman shortly after the war much to the annoyance of his father-in-law who fought on the Serb side he shot at me I shot at him and that doesn't mean I have to hate it I don't hate anybody but when the time comes such a man points a gun at you the time comes when you have to point one back at him and kill him normal people can't imagine that until they're in that situation themselves to them seriously we visit Mvula din at home he lives just a few minutes from the cemetery together with his wife and their seven-year-old daughter [Music] meperidine has no contact with his serbian father-in-law he's only ever seen him once when he picked up his wife there's been radio silence ever since [Music] before the war mixed families were normal there weren't any straights that didn't have at least one mixed couple we never paid attention to that in Bosnia back then I couldn't tell Croatian and Serbian names apart the war may be in the past but it's still a big problem for mixed couples they still fear they could have to choose sides if a conflict between the ethnic groups flares up again we're back with a mullah outside her school she believes that Bosnia could become one country even if the ethnic groups don't intermarry we like to say unity in diversity we have our differences and we have to tolerate them what about the students in the school today it's evening we've agreed to meet Gabriella and Natalia all the students go to the same bars and clubs they all know each other but do they ever fall in love or even marry back at the school Gabriela and Natalia had already said it was normal for every ethnic group to have his own view of history in the evening they tell us how difficult it can become when friendships become more serious I have a friend she's Catholic she's been with a Muslim for 8 months but they have to hide because of their families it's not about whether they love each other but about what people will say that's the biggest problem in bosnia-herzegovina and i think that will continue for many years boys join the girls it's a normal evening this cafe doesn't serve alcohol because it's mainly frequented by Muslims if you spend a bit of time here you get to recognize each other you know right away who's what ethnicity and who's what faith that's why it's unlikely you'll fall in love with someone of a different one if that happens you'll risk losing your family's trust over a boy never mind how strong your feelings are you have your family that's how we were raised we tell them that we can be friends but nothing more anyway after an evening in the bar word would have got round among the families it's the Sunday service in the village of Gooch Agora which is largely inhabited by Bosnian Croats [Music] this is the way Gabriela wants to preserve her Bosnia she intends to stay with her own and avoid any romantic entanglements with Muslims which is exactly what her mother wants to [Music] Oh when we look back at the old Yugoslavia the state's goal was to integrate the Christian Muslim and Serbian communities they wanted to create a nation of Yugoslavia jected it a divided school in a divided country what does the future hold for amylase son Ferris will his parents tell him who he can marry what if your son wanted to marry a Catholic you won sir I wouldn't allow it our faith says she has to be a Muslim a Mela there's no be wondering if they wanted to meet up and go out I wouldn't mind but if they wanted to get married I wouldn't want that he shouldn't marry someone with different values to us he could have a lot of problems in his marriage I see that all the time would the child be baptized I want my child to get married and I want grandchildren one day there would be a lot of conflict at the very latest over the baptism question I don't want him growing up with problems like that the school fence bothers amela moo-hyun ovitch but the wolves live on in private lives - the war changed people who knows if love will ever transcend Bosnia's ethnic divisions [Music]

The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government.

51,0,North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,"North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers.

this is where the ordeal ends for many of the refugees from North Korea this young high-ranking official from the North traveled thousands of kilometers on a trek across China all the way to Seoul he's been living here with a new identity for two years today he calls himself Michael Kim he's 28 years old and works part-time as a museum attendant this is an exhibition organised by the Seoul authorities it shows a model apartment in North Korea to illustrate what life looks like for the residents of Pyongyang having actually lived there myself I've been asked to explain in further detail what's her name rhymes oh boy I began my career in the State Security Agency the CIA of North Korea I worked in the financial department where I came to attention due to my expertise I was transferred to office 39 that was unusual I was only 25 when I joined I was the youngest member of staff their office 39 manages and directs all the economic activities of thousands of firms and factories the office was set up to earn money for the regime outside the country half of North Korea's gross domestic product comes from office 39 saravana times question I'm now with me [Music] Michael fled from one day to the next without warning his family he knew too much to be able to keep on believing in the regime he decided to meet us three weeks ago he insisted on showing his face while being interviewed in the hope of becoming too well known to be secretly assassinated reports from men who have been involved in office 39 the Guardians of North Korea's many financial secrets are extremely rare there have been precious few defectors fleeing the country means putting yourself in danger as well as family members left behind limb ill on the other hand was right at the bottom of the hierarchy upon who was sent halfway around the world to work on a construction site in the desert of Kuwait for me it wasn't about whether I wanted to do it time was running out I wanted to leave quickly so that we could get something to eat our leader Kim il-sung died in July 1994 and starting a year later in May 1995 the state was no longer able to provide the normal food rations people started to panic this was the first time they had reduced the rations I had a two year old daughter over there in order to leave you had to be married and have children if you don't have any children they won't let you out I thought family of four or five can live for at least six months on my salary of over $120 a month if I send it to Pyongyang after two months we asked why we weren't getting paid they said they had not been instructed by the party to pay our salary the party in North Korea was Kim jong-il our commander in chief that answer silenced us hundreds of workers had to keep their mouths shut we kept on working at night to using our flashlights we'd fight off sleep and just carry on I kept working like that for five months and all that time I didn't get paid I thought she did [Music] sending workers abroad was an idea first introduced in 1974 a gigantic network of clandestine companies and financial constructs gradually evolved all of them with one sole goal earning money for office 39 this man was likewise born in the North in Pyongyang in the early 2000s he was sent to Singapore he earned tens of millions of dollars for North Korea as a representative of Pyongyang's Northeast Asia Bank in 2003 he was suspected of having passed on information about the regime's finances he fled to South Korea today the former banker works for his new country's intelligence agencies he supports them in their struggle against the regime he once swore eternal allegiance to our main goal is to make foreign cash and this foreign cash business is secret complete the secret office namitha nine teams remain created there the system is set up like this all North Korean institutions where this foreign cash is generated they are obliged to report it to Kim to the top and then should bring that should pay that in cash Kim family mountain zone and before Kim jong-il so together or this and then spend it according to his priorities so through economies one is Kim family economy and the other one is the national economy run by the cabinet and run by their so called in a central planning so tuned family I called it you know royal court economy royal court economy they possess all the best profitable businesses best hotels there's department stores you know those services restaurants they are making money foreign key and then it also goes to give Antonio mountains of home so separate economy the money that you make will never go to the central economy no central bank finance ministry and trade bank they can never what poke their nose into our businesses you know they can never they can not ask anything Jim gathered or and then reallocator so let's say a billion US dollar a year she get that cash in cash and then she used that now nuclear and missile program is you know consumes a lot of money so is from Jim Jones pocket there are different workers you know at most one hundred and fifty thousand fifty thousand in Russia and little more in China and others in scattered around the world so one hundred and fifty thousand and they make a lot of money usually so 70 percentage or 80 percentage of the salary are cut and sent through the state and the party so if they make all of them make $100 then the amount is how much Shiva money on a peg put in your own parish man 15 million 15 million a month they don't make only one hundred US bucks a year iö month then they make more maybe several hundred is that least so a lot of money is going to control the volume of their cash income Kim Jong Un's fund increased dramatically in the past in the past 20 years in the past 20 years so he can buy more and she can do continue this in a nuclear and missile program you couldn't even get my turtle generally especially in places where we have a special agreement in places like Eastern Europe Southeast Asia Africa we have workers everywhere in Poland the Ukraine Uzbekistan Mongolia Viki Stan Longhorn while traditional yurt dwellings dot the modern cityscape the noise from the pneumatic hammers is omnipresent every day the concrete expanses continue to spread a little more in the Mongolian capital ulaanbataar for a period of over 70 years the country had a communist regime the city's grand monuments honoring the Eastern Bloc or a legacy of that era but after the collapse of the Soviet Union Mongolia switched to the Western capitalist camp people left rural regions in droves for the city's ulaan bataar is in urgent need of new housing but lacks sufficient manpower to build it the government has therefore been hiring workers from China Vietnam and North Korea for reinforcements the work is assigned the same way in each construction site the Mongolian workers are used for exterior jobs while the better qualified North Koreans for example take care of the interior the workers from Pyongyang are under observation day and night we want to approach them discreetly and first just send our interpreter hello hello the North Koreans working today sure do they sleep here yes and they never go out just to go shopping that's all and they even sleep here yes inside North Korea goes to extreme lengths to prevent its workers from coming into contact with the outside world and discovering a reality that is other than the one depicted in the daily propaganda they're only allowed to go out in groups so that they can keep an eye on each other but in the narrow market aisles of olin Betar we spot a North Korean worker who appears to be on his own can we talk while we look at the shoes yes when did you come here to Mongolia three years ago that's a long time yes and when are you going back home soon in a month and have you earned much money no I have not earned a lot of mongolian money and why not aren't you paid I didn't get much not much no I've been working but I never got any money they must be bad people there's a lot of bad people around really yep do you have family in North Korea how many children's I have one child my wife was pregnant when I left I've never seen my child so three years old three years boy a girl I got a letter saying it was a boy I'm desperate to go and see my son the workers usually have three year contracts and are not allowed to go home during that time only very few use their stay abroad to defect due to their families still living in North Korea they are all too aware that they would never see them again is Mongolia covering up the presence of these workers within its borders neither the government nor the companies employing them were prepared to talk to us but allegedly there are 1,200 North Koreans in the country they are there legally at the invitation of the Mongolian government the companies transfer the salaries directly to the North Korean embassy in ulaanbataar from where the money is then confiscated by the regime in Pyongyang a fraction of the Sun a few dozen euros a month at most is paid to the workers who use it to support their families in North Korea [Music] the construction workers are not the only moneymakers for the regime it also dispatches loggers to the forests of Siberia peasants to farms Pyongyang even exports doctors the regime's most lucrative source of income acupuncturists and chiropractors are sent abroad to open practices there what they earn however goes to the regime back home in Allah and Betar there are three of them we'd like to interview North Korean workers can we speak with you your nose Korean are you guys nuts coriander yes can we ask you a question we want to know why you guys are in Mongolia what do you do here for how long you've been here the doctors are not allowed to talk without permission from the embassy [Music] North Korea reportedly generates 450 million euros a year from remittances earned by its citizens secretly working abroad no records are kept of these secret funds and accounts documentation could potentially be used as evidence receipts bank transfers and internal notes are systematically destroyed on the orders of the Kim family this enables the regime to deny their existence in front of the international community but above all to the starving population back home they are not to get wind of the millions the Kim family earns at their expense I was a worker too I didn't get anything for six or eight months I worked myself to the bone so I reckoned why not help myself this man spent many years in Siberia prior to his defection he worked his way up to management level feeling remorse he wanted to break his years of silence in the hope that his testimony could help other former foreign workers who are still prisoners of the system the people positioned above the workers siphon off huge sums of money from those salaries for themselves let's say our bosses land a contract for 10 million they'll tell us that it's 7 million and we tell our foremen that it's even lower maybe 5 million so even then we're still able to transfer our mandatory share to the regime another trick is to negotiate 50 men for a job then we arrange to use only 20 and we send the rest elsewhere that means we can put aside a pile of money for ourselves in a good month how much did you earn around 20,000 dollars in one month yes do you know how much office 39 earns per year and how much of that goes into developing missiles nobody knows that that's the most strictly guarded secret of all nobody in office 39 can say neither the amount for the office workers nor the costs for their workers or any other figure if they were to talk about it at all plans to acquire nuclear weapons were first conceived by the regime back in 1953 during the Korean War after the u.s. threatened to deploy its nuclear arsenal against the country since coming to power in 2011 Kim jong-un has launched 85 missiles and conducted four nuclear tests twice as many as his father and grandfather combined the test missiles were fired over the Sea of Japan or in the direction of the Pacific with the capability to send nuclear warheads as far as California pyongyang now insists that washington would never dare to attack North Korea again on November 29th 2017 North Korea surprised the world with the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile kim jeong-hoon told his people that the country was now a nuclear power and boasted that it could deliver a strike anywhere in the u.s. at the same time a group of eight men of different nationalities convened at the New York headquarters of the United Nations where a race against time began they comprised experts on rocket technology finance aviation and shipping experts some were from the civilian sector others from intelligence agencies their work is top-secret their goal to dry up the secret money sources of the Kim family for their own safety no photos exist of this expert committee only Huw Griffiths the group's head since 2014 was willing to talk on camera these rockets that use ballistic missile-related technology their debris has been recovered by the South Korean navy who've had ships close enough when the wreckage has splashed down and they've recovered it and then they've invited the panel to inspect this this debris and once we've inspected the debris we note down the serial numbers we take photographs and then in many cases we're able to trace back the logistics and procurement chain so that's the rocker and then we have what's left of that this is one of the arm the Boosters you're seeing here there is a cluster of them round about you want to obscure this well our investigation show that a percentage of the components used in their rockets and missiles have been sourced abroad these goods will be exported in the first instance to other countries in Asia to business centers such as Singapore Hong Kong so that to a large multinational company based in say Europe who's selling the goods everything appears to be in order there's no North Korean trace on the only official paperwork in addition to research work the committee wields its own weapon the economy they devised sanctions that became progressively more severe in order to isolate North Korea we waited five months for official permission to fly to North Korea the North Korean diplomats didn't want us to film in winter fearing that the power outages might leave a bad impression finally in late March 2018 with temperatures rising again it happened we were granted permission to travel by train to North Korea via China and the border town of dong dong we find a country where time appears to have Stood Still a country that has been largely cut off from the outside world since 1953 every inch of arable land is farmed [Music] everything serves to feed the nation [Music] for seven hours the fields roll by to this day still farmed using only hand tools and manual labor most of North Korea's nuclear power plants are located in this region our route takes us close to three uranium mines a number of underground facilities and also the young beyond Nuclear Research Center which went operational in 1965 with the help of the Soviet Union it is the heart of the country's nuclear program our escorts await us in the capital Pyongyang we're now entering a world reserved for the privileged section of the population these streets and boulevards serve three million residents ten percent of the population the most loyal supporters of the regime a special permit is required to enter the city our two guides accompany us from dawn until late at night they've been tasked with showing us that Pyongyang despite all the sanctions imposed by the United Nations is no longer some economically crippled city with a poverty-stricken population all thanks to the new national heroes the scientists this architect spent eight years studying in France after leaving the a colonoscopy for architecture in Paris he returned to North Korea in 2010 today he's one of the best architects in the capital designing skyscrapers for the new elite this building was constructed in less than a year in just under eight months and that in an economically challenging time for Koreans but they still managed to complete it we want to show that we can live and continue to develop and can afford everything we need and promoting scientific advancement plays an extremely important role in our own development all the residents here have occupations in science and technology including teaching staff and everything else Lee Jungshin you're yourself [Music] hello hello can I keep my shoes on yes hello how old is he eight months look at the pictures they speak volumes there's our esteemed leader personally giving people decorations for Koreans these are the most glorious occasions I was really happy when we moved in here I could only cry and think about his love the marshal devotes a lot of time to the scientists and they reward him with their industriousness my husband has been a scientist for 30 years her husband teaches fluid mechanics at the Technical University of Kim Jake the apartment they were assigned has 200 square meters of floor space the regime also provides the furniture not everyone in Pyongyang lives in modern high-rises like this one but this family is far from an exception every year since Kim jong-un came to power he has built and inaugurated a new residential district that has involved 50 new residential blocks sprouting up within the space of a few months they're intended for the scientists and their families who have rendered extraordinary services for the regime one of these high-rises is home to an architect's office serving Kim jong-un excellent work [Music] but reasons to push up there there's always more work to be done there are always more project we never have enough architects this is in itself a huge building site everyone is tied up in at least two or three projects and is working non-stop but it's still not really enough we do all-nighters given the international situation and all the sanctions doesn't that hamper construction I don't see how that would have an impact I saw a lot of construction sites in Europe where work was immediately suspended after a crisis but here we carry on working despite the growing number of projects in the pipeline we aren't afraid of anything we keep on making progress regardless [Music] how is North Korea able to finance this construction boom has it been able to shrug off the sanctions out on the streets the standardized socialist dress code has been lent a little more color in the last three years the mood seems almost relaxed and yet the regime still governs its people with an iron fist even the slightest critical gesture or word of disapproval will soon find someone in one of the country's many camps for political prisoners since Kim jong-un has been in power however there have been signs of a reorientation the orders now are to ensure that the economy evolves at the same pace as the nuclear program [Music] cut all this to size let's be careful down there you have to cut it straight look this is not straight we built this entire set of ourselves and thanks to these Korean built machines we've been able to automate a number of jobs and also reduce our power consumption as a result we've almost doubled our production capacity everything here is a joint product of the experts from the Academy of Science and the researchers at Kim il-sung University where does the material for the shoes come from we're unable to import materials due to the strategy of our enemies so we produce everything ourselves that involves checking which components we have available so that we can make our own shoes the key factors for this economic revival innovation and adaptation the goal is to persevere and prove to the world that the country doesn't need anyone else we have solar panels we have them installed on practically all factory roofs they generate up to 400 kilowatts of electricity our factories need a capacity of only 300 kilowatts that means the electricity generated from the solar panels is easily enough to keep our factory running despite the sanctions and the isolation the shoe factory is one of a number of model factories that Kim jong-un has had built for each sector of Industry they all include a digital control center with a direct connection to Pyongyang's universities and research centers more model factories are to be set up across the country the regime dictates which roles everyone is assigned the country's economy and society are centrally planned right down to the fate of each individual young North Koreans know as soon as they're in elementary school how their lives will pan out depending on their abilities their family background and the needs of the party the state selects their career many end up in the military the country has a standing army of 1 million soldiers in North Korea men are subject to a minimum compulsory military service totaling 10 years those who managed to be admitted to Kim il-sung University the country's most prestigious college are usually exempt this is where the next generation of engineers economists bankers and businessmen are educated the future personnel of office 39 this facility was founded by our commander in chief with the noble idea of training men and women for leadership positions in the career of tomorrow our dear leader Kim Jong Il's sent us a letter in December 2009 saying keep your feet on the ground and look at the world combined a noble spirit with a wealth of knowledge and become the supporting structure for my late father's revolution make sure that the whole world looks up to the career of Kim il-sung's North Korea's economic upswing an economic miracle a final fake conflict to keep the people in the dark about the new wave of sanctions threatening to bring the country to its knees the official figures cannot be verified unable to talk to citizens directly we can't say what they think and feel all we can take away are our general observations traveling across the country the impression you get is that a brighter future awaits following the famine of the 1990s which claimed the lives of between 600,000 and 1 million people the streets have no cars but some dashes of new color life is hard but seemingly not as hard as it used to be Kim jong-un spent part of his childhood under a false identity in Switzerland did he bring the dream of modernization and opening up with him from Europe the young dictator possesses a nuclear bomb that protects him at home and abroad and also consolidates his power but where as his father and grandfather built statues and palaces he builds railways bowling alleys swimming pools museums of natural history and leisure parks facilities no longer just serving the elite culture advances in Science and Industry opium for a people who are for now still in awe of new developments the aim to reinforce the dictatorship now in its third generation in a sign of the times on this evening the colors of North Korea shine in splendor for the first time after dark is North Korea getting outside help Russia and above all China vote in favor of UN sanctions while at the same time can continuing to trade with North Korea an overthrow of Kim jong-un's regime is not something they want to see the country secret coffers and assets keep growing even in places where you'd least expect it such as Berlin in the heart of Europe in 2016 the German authorities began trying to close down this youth hostel located on the grounds of the North Korean embassy since 2008 the rent totaling more than 38,000 euros a month has gone directly to the Kim family Germany has terminated the lease but the owners of the hostel have steadfastly refused to vacate the premises do you know whether office 39 makes money in France or Germany in France or Germany sure there are no workers in those countries because of the stringent laws but one thing they do have is money and wealth North Korea buys and sells real estate for rental or speculative profit if they would do direct business in those countries and openly show that our company is a North Korean company we'd immediately be subject to a tax on it we rent out apartments nobody knows who the owner is really we just collect the rents do you know the names of these firms if I were to tell you that they'd end up on the sanctions list right away yes North Korea is an awful dictatorship but the people who serve the regime faithfully like me or my friends or even the bosses aren't just doing our job [Music] perhaps what they do is in itself bad but there's still a code of honor between us do they earn money in the u.s. not that I know of but we do do everything we can to relieve them of money we have technology hacking that includes blackmailing software North Korea hacks into the u.s. infrastructure industry your digital companies we can't analyze or make much use of the data as such we just hack our way in and then demand money in return for guaranteeing that we will keep the data to ourselves it's basically North Korea taking digital data as hostage you know stopping this in a cold the real trade with China coal and iron ore and other stuff you know this is the real sanction so it took only several months but they would cannot stop everything how can they stop all North Queens you know how many shadow companies and operatives are there how far does their network truly extend and what kind of danger do they pose in our final reports the Security Council we've we've documented North Korean weapons and prohibited military training programs in dozens of African and Middle Eastern member states in Mozambique the contracts one of the contracts we saw was worth more than six million dollars in Tanzania the contract was worth a similar amount in euros a little more I think maybe twelve million so it's all about the money part of the problem with ballistic missiles is that the technology wasn't supplied to all the countries that wanted this technology so the the North Koreans stepped in and this is very alarming that in terms of proliferation there was this new killer new killer facility in in Syria that was set up with North Korean assistance and this is this is the kind of activity that I know concerns a lot of people and the North Koreans also have a huge stockpile of chemical weapons as well it's been 20 years since little fled the Kuwaiti desert where he'd been working on construction sites in the meantime he's become a father again here in Seoul he has two sons they know they also have a big sister somewhere on the other side of the border you don't worry think about it the more I wonder what it is that made me who I am if it were a normal regime I would never have run away this mismanage system forced me to make that terrible decision [Music] once a month in Seoul refugees from the north meet up in a Christian Center in order to remember their families and their people back home almost like orphans of the man who was once their leader they turned to their God to rediscover a purpose in their lives while in the north those taking orders from the dictators continued to work in the shadows at home and abroad to guarantee the survival of the regime

52,0,Fleeing climate change — the real environmental disaster | DW Documentary,"How many millions of people will be forced to leave their homes by 2050? This documentary looks at the so-called hotspots of climate change in the Sahel zone, Indonesia and the Russian Tundra.Lake Chad in the Sahel zone has already shrunk by 90 percent since the 1960s due to the increasing heat. About 40 million people will be forced to migrate to places where there is enough rainfall. Migration has always existed as a strategy to adapt to a changing environment. But the number of those forced to migrate solely because of climate change has increased dramatically since the 1990s. It is a double injustice: after becoming rich at the expense of the rest of the world, the industrialized countries are now polluting the atmosphere with their emissions and bringing a second misfortune to the inhabitants of the poorer regions. One of them is Mohammed Ibrahim: as Lake Chad got hotter and drier, he decided to go where the temperatures were less extreme and there was still a little water, trekking with his wife, children and 70 camels from Niger to Chad and then further south. The journey lasted several years and many members of his herd died of thirst. Now he and his family are living in a refugee camp: they only have seven camels left. Mohammed is one of many who have left their homelands in the Sahel - not because of conflict and crises, but because of the high temperatures. He's a real climate refugee._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

talking us people on the move in the millions than we're talking about people in the billions droughts floods hurricanes vast areas are being devastated by environmental catastrophe how many people will be forced to leave their homes by the mid-century not due to conflict in war but due to climate change we appear to be on the path to a troubling future [Music] [Music] [Music] from the Sahil region to Southeast Asia from the Pacific to the Caribbean some people are fleeing rising waters others droughts the world's population began to soar about 200 years ago soon it will top 10 billion greenhouse gases are rising a pace the resulting warming of the Earth's atmosphere is wreaking havoc on the climate humankind which is responsible for this warming is becoming its victim more and more people are forced to leave their homes inequality is being exacerbated by climate change wealthy industrialized nations are polluting our air while the main victims live in the global South for example in Indonesia Ponty bahagia which means happy beach lies on the indian ocean due to rising seas and heavy rainfall the village is sinking into the sea the flooding continues even now during dry season [Music] the local primary school is damned and smells of rot parents say conditions are intolerable and more than half the children have been taken out of school most jayati rahmatullah teaches in primary grades he attended this school himself and is determined to persevere his classroom flooded for the first time in 2013 conditions here are very very difficult for us we often have to send the children home when the classrooms flood the children sit with their legs in water regular instruction has become impossible the children are falling behind within the next five or six years rahmatullah believes the school will be submerged it will be abandoned along with the village what will it look like here three decades from now in the year 2050 but at that time there will be the most extreme conditions of the weather forward with our 17,000 Islands a lot of course and that will be eaten up by the sea so life will not be the same as here there's a lot of illnesses there will be plagues and the economic growth of the hook on the whole world will be disturbed by horizontal strife one against the other because fighting for food water maybe arrows her death will be the very sad picture in 2050 for the Indonesian special envoy the catastrophic impact of unchecked climate change is the biggest challenge facing humankind today ten years ago the topic was barely on the radar Jakarta the capital of Indonesia with some 10 million residents it's the largest city in Southeast Asia around 30 million people live in the metropolitan area making it the second largest urban conglomeration in the world the fish markets are located in North Jakarta the scent of the ocean lies in the air mixing with the odours of the city just a few kilometers from the city center the problems confronting this tropical metropolis become apparent residents struggle with smog heat heavy traffic pollution population density and poor hygienic conditions and with increasing frequency flooding the slum district of Dutta is located near the airport it's 5,000 residents used to live near the sea but these days it almost looks like they live in it EKOS umano has lived in dot up since the 1970s he and his neighbors have watched the rising sea level with concern at least once a month the flooding reaches his knees sometimes the water remains two days sometimes a week it flooded here for the first time around the year 2000 first it was just a few centimetres since 2010 the flooding has been getting higher and higher but it's never been as bad as it is now in Jakarta the district's closest to the coast faced the biggest problems poor neighborhoods like Dada will be among the first to need complete relocation the slums most at-risk are situated along a wide corridor that snakes through the city says urban planner Marco kusuma vijaya only about the coastal areas the flood actually up streams in the city center of Jakarta Fabian dear from my office kusuma V Jaya is director of the rujak Center for urban studies which searches for solutions for climate related problems right now their focus is the depletion of groundwater from the area the declining water table has even more serious consequences than rising sea levels it's causing the ground to sink and large parts of the city with it on the way of Jakarta the sea level rises at between 4 to 6 millimeters per year but was is that the land of Jakarta is subsiding by 3 to 20 centimeters in February 2013 nearly half of Jakarta was underwater scenes like this are likely to become increasingly common ocean levels continue to rise the land is collapsing and heavy rains are becoming more frequent about one third of Jakarta is currently below sea level environmental problems are causing a growing number of people to flee the city but most want to remain or have no other choice in an effort to protect the capital the government has begun building a seawall but only six of the planned 50 kilometers have been built and even their water is finding its way through it's becoming clear that everything located directly on the water will one day fall victim to it like this mosque the bad thing is actually most of the poor neighborhoods will be flooded because the rich neighborhood have raised themselves you know but exactly because they erase their ground so the water that come to their ground will actually flow into the surrounding poor or neighborhood poor districts located along one of Jakarta's 13 rivers often stay submerged for weeks when the floodwaters rise areas near the Chile one river are most at risk like this low-income district by the Chile one tributary Tonk all situated just four hundred meters from the ocean the drivers housekeepers fishermen construction workers in such that live here all face climate change related risks this estimated that 65% of our operation will be directly victimized weather which is a lot of people of his 65 percent of 300 million three hundred million is 170 million people will we are an island nation and around six thousand islands are inhabited because coastal areas will be destroyed Steff they came up with figures of 14 million four zero million because they are the coastal people and those are prone to the effects of landslides so about forty million people are directly involved and those involved may have to leave their homes [Music] Indonesia is prone to a variety of natural disasters from cyclones to mudslides flooding to droughts but there is one place that is at risk of all of these the island of Java and it's here that one of the world's most densely populated areas is located Jakarta the city's infamous traffic jams lasts almost until midnight only to resume again at dawn more than 3.5 million people commute into the city every day just 100 kilometers southeast the bustle of Jakarta is a distant memory chan your district is situated at the foot of two inactive volcanoes it's one of Java's most fertile farming regions the rice vegetables and fruit grown here help feed the country's capital the village of Saranga is accessible only by motorbike or on foot dudu Durrani runs a small coffee plantation here like his father and grandfather he is a farmer coffee used to be a safe crop choice it fetched a better price than vegetables and was harder than rice but that's changing when I was younger all farmers would plant during rainy season so January February in March and then everyone would harvest during dry season but now my colleagues and I are desperate because it's often dry in the rainy season and in the dry season it rains we are paying the price for climate change our harvests have dropped massively by about 60% nearly half of local farmers have given up they've moved to other parts of Indonesia or left the country altogether some have become construction workers in Saudi Arabia but doo doo de Roni doesn't want to join them I can't imagine doing anything else I will stay here as long as possible I'm a farmer that's who I am I'm going to try to somehow adapt to climate change if it's too dry when it's time to plant for example I'll just wait these mountainous regions don't just supply food to the cities their forests also help store rainwater but extreme weather conditions are growing increasingly common here and still forests are falling victim to logging leaving rain water to flow unhindered into the valley sometimes the water sweeps away everything in its path [Applause] mudslides have had fatal consequences these images date from 2017 and 2018 [Music] [Music] special climate invoice Hockman viitala says that by mid century climate change will have forced 40 million people to flee their homes in Indonesia alone farmers who can no longer till their fields slum dwellers whose ten roofed huts have sunk into the sea [Music] [Music] most experts agree that it's the world's coldest regions that have become the cauldron for climate change these are the Arctic the Antarctic Alaska and much of the permafrost of Russia [Music] [Music] Nikita Z mph trained as a mathematician but his father Sarah's lifelong commitment inspired Nikita to change course now like his father he has dedicated his life to preserving Russia's permafrost he's come to the Kalima River in northeastern Siberia an eight-hour flight from Moscow to gather evidence that the permafrost is vanishing the ground has warmed up to 3 degrees Celsius causing the top layer of the ice to melt one side effect is that more and more rare fossils are surfacing for paleontologists this would be a treasure trove a field of riches from the distant Pleistocene epoch mama swag not the biggest one but every size 20 so here was in the position the consistent here was huge and own Everest quake homes around one mammoth and labeled for 40,000 years and all never here on this quake home to now lay around 600 skeletons so every once in a while there all along the Kalima soil is eroding sliding into the river as a consequence of the melting permafrost Nikita Zima calls plants like these zombies because the soil in which they are growing was Behrend for forty thousand years this vegetation will also soon end up in the river the changes taking place here could soon be a reality across wide expanses of Russia and it could also have a dramatic impact on the global climate and mass migration of people's 4 there is an immense amount of biomass still trapped within the permafrost [Music] if that trapped co2 and methane were to be released into the atmosphere the pace of climate change would increase dramatically so these are roots of grasses which grew here maybe around 40,000 years ago and the problem that is it huge storage of carbon and take all these little groups and put them on the one side of the burns and on the other side of the bones put all the background vegetation of the planet so basically all trees and shrubs of the planet you will see that this tiny little roots wait more and if Paris will start to degrade everywhere all this will become a way for microbes to eat and they were very soon converting to greenhouse gases co2 methane that's ice pure ice out there and you see when this ice is melting the wood is mixed in with this soil and creating this mud folks which are children down the slope and the gradations have been very rapidly here so it's a combination of both loads of carbon and lots of ice and that's a give you a very rapid carbon bond so every problem that will be happening with the global warming worldwide with this thing will be probably amplified so if it will it will see if it's going to be bad somewhere to turn very bad so if there is a way to stop that from happening like we need to apply that because if not you know you can write any apocalyptic scenarios you want and probably most of them will come true [Music] it's breakfast time in Nikita zoomorphs guesthouse interest in permafrost has soared over the past decade so now the guest rooms here at the station are usually booked year-round with researchers from all over the world this is the group from Oxford University here to study the transformations currently underway in what used to be frozen earth during the Soviet era this enormous satellite used to broadcast television programming from Moscow the Z morphs turned the station into a home base for scientists from around the world [Music] yeah well most though the data that has been collected in Siberia and across Russia's Far East are alarming normally the vegetation binds greenhouse gases in the summer and only releases very small amounts back into the atmosphere in winter which is but for the past few years the permafrost that's thawing more and more in the summer is releasing ever-increasing amounts of methane and co2 during the winter at the moment the biosphere is acting as a well could be say as a friend as a moderate break on climate change so about 40% of the carbon dioxide we emit is being absorbed by the biosphere and that's acting to slow down climate change if that wasn't happening climate change would be even faster than it is but one of the big concerns we have as system scientists is understanding how long will the biosphere keep acting as a break and is there a danger that at some time in the future with this break we'll turn into an accelerator scientists from all over are turning their attention to the permafrost and its potential impact on climate change this group of researchers from Prague is being hosted by the Institute of applied ecology of the North in the Republic of Sakha the researchers have just returned from a crater that is carved into the permafrost these soil samples are a gift to the Institute in return the researchers hope to obtain permission to exhibit some of their spectacular finds in a museum at home remains of a mammoth and the mummified remains of an extinct horse from the Pleistocene epoch the crater in which the fossilized remains were found was named the bottarga crater but locals call it the Gateway to the underworld it's easy to see why [Music] in the 1960s a small section of forest was cleared to make way for a new road the permafrost originally beneath the trees began eroding at first the hole was just a few meters deep the stood on average the mega crater is between 40 and 60 metres deep and in some places it's 100 meters deep it's 1.5 kilometers long and about one kilometer wide right now but it's hard to determine exactly how wide it is because it's expanding so quickly these kinds of catastrophic events could become increasingly common and not just in residential areas but anywhere in the wilderness wherever there are pipelines and natural gas facilities our entire infrastructure could be impacted most of the cities in Siberia and in Russia's Far East could be affected about 25 million people in all how big would the impact be if all the world's permafrost were to melt so far there isn't enough cross regional research to answer that but there are findings regarding the polar region from a global terrestrial network for permafrost in 1996 the permafrost melted to a depth of 45 centimeters in the summer by 2017 it melted to a depth of 87 centimeters a nearly 100 percent increase over just 20 years this poses a danger to both people and infrastructure natural gas and oil pipelines are particularly affected Greenpeace has estimated that leaks and pipelines cost by thawing soil are leading to about 1% of oil being lost that oil some 5 million tons of it each year seeps into the ground the residents of the Arctic city of cesky in the far northeast of Russia are bearing witness to this rapid transformation temperatures are rising inexorably asphalt on the streets is beginning to buckle and several buildings are showing signs that the solid ground on which they once stood has begun to sink the city of chair ski on the kolyma river is also home to Nikita Zi Moff even though temperatures drop here to minus 60 degrees Celsius in the winter the erosion of the permafrost soil appears unstoppable this is especially apparent at the former water treatment plant like all the buildings here it stands on pillars [Music] the earth began to sink here just two years ago now the crater is already 10 meters deep as soon as it starts it's going very rough so when I was here a week ago there was some those two place with you in the air and now we came they already come up down and there is a huge niche going underneath the purpose of where this is this ice it's been eroded and eventually all that slope you'll collapse also so this process kind of grow in them with I know centimeters a day maybe tens of centimeters today within the hot Baker so we have serious building the firm fourth area and now with climate getting warmer temperatures also getting warmer and with degradation it looks like that so all the infrastructure in the next few decades will probably come up elsewhere the heat of the Sun is relentless this is Cameroon in central Africa here in the streambed of the my abullah River signs of despair are everywhere [Music] the north of Cameroon receives two months of rainfall a year at most in August and September during the rest of the year people must walk far to find water or dig deep older people who live here say that water used to flow abundantly through the Myo bula river into the Logan River and eventually discharging into Lake Chad but those days are gone [Music] Edwyn kappa works for the Caritas charity organization in the region his job is to ward off looming humanitarian catastrophes access to drinking water is an enormous problem for people and animals here in the far north of Cameroon [Applause] [Music] Kadapa often visits villages near the provincial capital of maroa today he's in william home to many herders Kadapa has been a social worker for many years and knows the signs of an impending humanitarian catastrophe in the summer of 2018 the region was on the brink only women used to fetch water but now it's so bad the entire family has to help now when young people want to build a house they have no water when we want to work there is no water a young man wants to be a farmer or work in sales and there's no water it's already begun young men are leaving they're going to the big cities to joan day and Dwolla people are starting to leave we no longer know how we will be able to manage the drought is especially hard on people who must find water not just for their families but also for their livestock the guy gongfu believes he is about 60 years old and has always tended his herds now it's so dry that he and his son John Paul are running out of options this animal feed was harvested the previous year by now it's completely dried out and there isn't much left if the next month doesn't bring rain the Colville family fear the worst if their livestock die they will be left with nothing the spring is six kilometers away we have to fetch water twice a day just to have barely enough for our four cattle the goats and my family don't quibble over the past 10-15 years the situation has grown much worse that's why young people aren't able to stay in their villages they're forced to leave to go to the cities there's no future for them here for such a shape as given away by that video every day [Music] young people are moving away because the lack of water is stealing their futures herders are having to leave for the cities because their livestock died of thirst traders grain farmers and hunters people from across northern Cameroon are leaving their homes they are climate refugees a sign of things to come but climate is hardly ever the only reason behind a decision to migrate poverty is often a factor fear of terror attacks can also play a role most of the people gathered here fled from the Islamist group Boko Haram in neighboring Nigeria they are now unintentionally contributing to the desperate situation facing local Cameroonians people stand in line for up to eight hours to receive a few kilos of food they wait quietly and patiently despite the brutal heat there are 200 sacks of millet and corn for 30 thousand people this help is urgently needed but it's only a drop in the bucket [Applause] we've already seen several waves of migration people keep trying to make their way south to find farmland in areas where there's more rain many people have left here heading south here in the mem a region the rains used to begin in April now the rains come in late May sometimes in early June in the past it rained until October but last year the rains ended in August that's a disaster for us farmers in May so st. Granada Kapalua Pisa Domini in order to farm properly soil must remain moist for at least four months out of the year experts call this the 120 day line if rain lasts less than four months soil will grow arid grain cultivation becomes impossible and livestock die in the Sahil region this line between survival and disaster is moving ever further south toward the equator where there's more rain from 1970 to 2016 up to 100 kilometre wide stretches of land that were once arable have become desert as a result hundreds of camps have arisen in the Sahil region filled with people who have lost their livelihoods temperatures reach 45 degrees Celsius in the shade and 60 degrees in the full Sun people here live at the edge of despair reliant on food deliveries from NGOs ISA and Golda and her family live in one of these camps they have enough food for now and access to a water pump but when they fled the drought they lost their independence their fields where they used to plant millet and onions grew arid ISA her husband and their five children are climate refugees see we're suffering so much there's no rain we have no water we don't have enough water to grow anything yapple people here heading south hoping that they'll be able to grow crops there and find something to eat in Southeast Asia flooding is driving people from their homes in Africa it's the devastating drought Cameroon is suffering as is neighboring Chad Lake Chad which lent its name to the entire region is the only natural source of water in the area researchers from the International Organization for Migration have come to the region surrounding lake chad to investigate the connection between climate change and the rise of climate migration mushara murillo of the UN migration organization has spent years in the Sahil region every encounter and every conversation adds another layer of detail to his preliminary findings [Music] today Murillo and his team are visiting a camp for displaced people in their Lake Chad under the shadow of a nearly barren tree he speaks with Mohammad Ibrahim the head of the family Ibrahim tells Murillo he is a herder the family suffered a terrible ordeal before finally arriving at Lake Chad it was heat and lack of water that drove him from their home climate change has a huge impact on us herders if there's no rain no plants grow and without green plants to eat our animals die so we herders are hit very hard by this from the chat the chat side Nigerian side the Cameroonian side and either side they all depended on this source you can realize that this lake is unique is just a freshwater with in an arid area so so many levels dependent on this lectured if the lake chad disappears it will be a serious environmental catastrophe because without the lectures we can hardly talk about a living atmosphere in the lake Chad region in 1963 lake chad covered an area of 25,000 square kilometres by 2007 it was just 2,500 square kilometres more than 90 percent smaller and the lake continues to shrink if the lake were to completely dry up more than 50 million people would probably become climate refugees and this figure does not take into account the rate of population growth lake chad remains a life source for millions of people but as it continues to shrink water is becoming an ever scarce ER and more valuable resource and so our arable land and the fish in the lake as Lake Chad gets smaller competition for these resources will become increasingly bitter even now fishermen in the region are competing for dwindling stocks of carp Nile perch and tilapia with climate change there is a key impact on the lake in that it it affect the distribution and the pattern of fish and is that in mind its effect the fishing industry as well so basically it's it touches on three major level strategies of people around in this surrounding this area namely farmers hair does and fishermen the region surrounding Lake Chad is emblematic of the close connection between climate change and migration [Applause] in the past we had a lot of fish good fish we sold them here or over in Nigeria but now they have problems with terrorists and here we have no more fish in our lake from Lake Chad to Indonesia farmers can no longer rely on predictable seasons for planting and harvesting the climate has become a threat there are hurricanes cyclones drought flooding mudslides and wildfires and the melting permafrost could soon exacerbate all of those around the globe on the american continent people are fleeing droughts in northern Brazil in the Caribbean and the southern United States it's hurricanes in Africa people are leaving the arid Sahil region some will likely head north to Europe in Spain Italy in Greece people will also flee the rising heat in Asia coastal regions are vanishing under rising oceans people are fleeing to higher ground in river deltas like Bangladesh the South Sea Islands will be completely submerged how many people will have become climate refugees by 2050 we know at the moment that approximately 20 million people are being displaced every year that's numbers more or less true for the last decades so we can say that under climate change population growth possibly more vulnerable populations this number is going to grow if you look today we know that every year at least 25 million people flee so the fast forward 30 years so that's why I think if you go to the figure 500 millions it's not a very high estimate seizures are the names of the do this gee Monsieur if I had to estimate I'd say maybe a fifth or a quarter of the world's population will be forced to migrate so that's about two to three billion people [Music]

and through chambers of splendor filled with so many objects that the heart so desires I saw miracles of human skill and artistry and flawless beings who seemingly lacked nothing but it appeared they were all searching for something [Music] such strange creatures [Music] the whole world is in a big mess the more they get the more they want president Bush after 9/11 said I urge all Americans to go shopping this print would still make me money it's the thing in me I grew up in a way that I will still make money even if I was left in the desert there is someone who tries to say you need this there are enough people who think they need that that's what the marketing strategy is is that it always tells you you shouldn't be content the minge is not humans are by nature greedy evolution has shown us that as long as this mechanism doesn't become too dominant it serves the goals of the individual perfectly individuals each mujuy to survive today I go so far as to say it's a symptom of an illness catastrophe is on its way catastrophe you and I we cannot even imagine I wonder if we're a viable form of life maybe we're just an evolutionary flash in the pan and we'll be sitting right next to the dinosaurs at the cockroach Museum one thing I would love to say that you must always think of your death [Music] [Music] I kept asking myself why are we like this we're caring and compassionate but we're also egocentric and reckless we give and reward we create and destroy what is our problem what drives us I went in search of answers [Applause] humanities at the crossroads I think a historical moment the physical environment is undermine to the point where we need to attend to it war is something that we ought to think about what why does that happen people are pervasively unhappy on top of all of that we keep building Walmart's I see insatiable greed as inextricably connected to all of these other difficulties that if we don't recognize and come to terms with we're literally putting our species at risk you know you might ask to talk about Darwin well if you're asked to talk about Darwin it has to be about evolution and what's the word evolution mean change and so so evolution is an idea that Darwin is trying to understand and what's his strikingly original proposal natural selection suit [Music] Cubans are on the one hand very similar to all other forms of life in that we share a basic biological predisposition you know towards survival but on the other hand we're so smart that we actually recognize that we exist [Music] and the point here is that being alive and knowing it is grounds for great joy [Music] on the other hand it also carries a very terrible existential burden if you know that you're here you know that someday like all living things that you won't be here if that's all we thought about I'm gonna die I may walk outside and get hit by a meteor we would literally be paralyzed by abject terror what human beings did is to construct and maintain what the anthropologists today call culture and all cultures offer some recipe for immortality either literally through the heavens and after lives and reincarnation z' of all the world's great religions or symbolically through the belief that some vestige of our identity will persist over time nevertheless [Music] that's why you want to have children that's why you want to build pyramids that's why we want to write great books and symphonies that's why we want to have a lot of money human beings are motivated to have a lot of stuff because psychologically speaking it gives them a sense that they may be able to live forever desire greed and the struggle that brings about anger and aggression from the philosophical Buddhist philosophical perspective are all resultant states of a person consistently trying to look at what is not true we talk about three fundamental truths that things are impermanent secondly the fundamental principle of everything is said to be emptiness [Music] but now what happens is we try to build something that makes us forget about this we try to make things permanent and that struggle creates the third truth of this suffering we begin to then hang on to things I'll give you an example you know if I have a shirt and every time I go out to do some shopping you buy another shirt you may have 12 in your closet but you'll buy the thirteenth just so that you have a sense of you'll live long enough to wear altered in shirts or perhaps even more than that so there's a sense of every day consistently doing something because of which we may be able to more solidify our sense of immortality our sense of living continuously not changing and that struggle consistently builds up all these neuroses and the prominent one of them becomes the greed [Music] death is a very real physical phenomenon and it doesn't matter how good your symbols are your religion your politics your money there's still symbols and none of them will be sufficient to minimize death anxiety or rather to eliminate it you can reduce it but you can't get rid of it and then finally just really to make matters worse we also don't like the idea that we're animals from a starkly biological point of view we're not all that much more significant or enduring than lima beans or armadillos an animal takes only what it needs but the human animal is different more than seven billion of us populate the planet and each of us desires something desires more is this perhaps the secret of success [Music] [Music] the UM mess instrumentally now developed instruments to measure greed as a personality trait and also to elicit a state of greed in people mentioned in Ireland social context of a citizen associates this is the balloon task we use it to measure our test subjects willingness to take risks the subject has to try to keep inflating of the loom the larger the balloons the more it's worth the punch period in each round the subjects play for real money every time they inflate the balloon they're risking that it might first and then their money would be gone as pets I incur nest we've been able to demonstrate that people who tend to be greedy are more likely to take risks when performing this task so they inflate the balloon further than do normal test subjects and we see that people who tend towards greed also demonstrate an altered brain response in this archaic see in this graphic we see how our brain responds to rewards and a punishment so far we've been able to demonstrate that the more greedy the test subject the weaker are the punishments signals so she has indeed wished - technology GABA is this interesante that's that what is interesting is that these people also tend to want to maintain night State the classic experiments of old Simula on the brains dopamine system are very interesting in this respect the amine cysteine indium if electrodes are implanted in exactly this region of a rat's brain and the rat is then put into a situation where it can stimulate that dopamine system directly by pressing a lever the rats will continue pressing the lever until they die is a test equipment and this is presumably one of the biological mechanisms that helps explain excessive breed [Music] [Applause] come on Ren there you go bloom we go oh you can have two okay where's my lead oh you already have two [Music] most primates are highly social but these guys are atypical in that they're also highly tolerant there is a hierarchy and everyone knows who's on top and the individuals at the top get more males get more matings females get more access to resources but you don't have this really steep hierarchy where there's one individual at the top who gets everything and you also see some things that you don't necessarily see across the primates like respect for possessions so we can look for instance at how do you respond when you get more and I get less how do you respond when you get less and I get more and that's tractable to study experimentally hey guys so the experiment itself is very simple it take two monkeys or two Apes set them next to one another and you interact with them sequentially and what they have to do is a very simple task so we give them a token they return it and give them the food reward for having completed it but then the critical component is how does this individual respond to that medium preferred food like a cucumber or a piece of bell pepper when their partner gets something much better [Music] see this that could be due to inequity it could be due to hey look my partner got something better than me or it could just be due to general sort of greed for lack of a better term hey there's a better food out there and I wanted from an evolutionary perspective the behavior that we consider greed which is acquiring as many resources as possible is important most animals live more at the margin than modern Western humans do so not acquiring as many resources for them is a real risk of death in human societies so my perspective is that Green has taken on not just acquiring as much as possible but acquiring as much as possible explicitly at the expense of other individuals and I don't think that that's something that you can apply to animals one day narcissus came upon a spring that was so clear that he could see himself in it as if in a mirror when he saw his own reflection he fell in love with its beauty we too like to see ourselves as the center of the world the individual is now the measure of all things and so we yearn for recognition and self-esteem we collect relationships photos and likes SUVs shoes records are we like narcissus addicted to our own egos [Music] [Music] being successful in business is an art and when you have it you can be able to take things to a level that people would be surprised how much you describe me to price this we'll talk about that the International price this talk about our prices 700 square metres fifth floor x eight floors x our logo price one thousand one thousand two thousand it will cost you five point six million yeah I rather do those types of videos cuz that's exactly what it's gonna be I will tell you my philosophy is very simple there is a thin line separating a businessman and a criminal why because anything I do somebody's bound to self cheated him so all of us as businessmen throughout the world whether it's Bill Gates its Richard Branson we are all viewed the crew knows but it's because we think beyond other people think President Mugabe is my brother from a European perspective or the nephew from our African be a brother we cannot have the world full of critics we went there and by the shrinked there are fewer critics more duels that way the world economy will be nice to live welcome to my house I want to show you around as well as the achievements I've had for for so many years and yeah you know it's cool which is near my old offices they gave me an award for building a school block and then an organization help us help ourselves honored me for my work for humanitarian reasons so they gave me this award where this award from BAFTA its main focus is to recognize those who have done a lot of work in human rights affirmative action and empowerment issues you know internationally that's me in here with my main lounge where him if you come in and friends and family we are we we do meet and toss around you know have conversations of sorts political economy and family [Music] the property has a helipad on top so when it's cold here we did we do put the heaters so it really has you know heaters over here and this room is called him that the dining room if I'm refurbishing this house this is the only room I don't refurbish because it gives me that sentimental relationship with the president and yeah the man that money can buy [Music] this is it I know where I came from I came from being a vegetable vendor my bed was their floor the grand elliptic floor that's where I used to sleep with a very poor linen blanket that goes beneath me and one on top and that history is why I want to you know be able to show I got a live well [Music] [Music] things like the racetrack and all other forms of public spectacle are of interest to folks for so many reasons one aspect of the racetrack is gambling another part of it is to highlight one status relative to one's fellow human beings somebody is quote better not by how big or strong he or she is but rather how one dresses how you conduct yourself and how you establish that you are richer than more worthy than and therefore more immune from death than all of the other folks who surround you in some ways this is no different than dominance hierarchies and primates [Applause] we love heroes and therefore have become preoccupied with being the best at something even if it's how many hotdogs I can eat in ten minutes in America we're number one not in science or literacy or anything important we are number one in depression however how could this be what you have to do is look at cultural values to see if there realistically attainable by the average individual if you're a male you're basically valued by how much you have and this is the so-called American Dream if you work hard enough you can have as much money as LeBron James or or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates [Music] but realistically for every millionaire there's got to be hundreds of thousands of people working part time at Walmart without benefits same for women but they have a different cultural burden we teach women that in order to be beautiful you have to be ridiculously thin your breasts excluded of course so if I can't floss my teeth with you you're too fat and you have to remain perpetually young which of course is biologically impossible Wow we cherish values that are simply not possible to attain [Music] if you say I want to be true to the world you got to get rid of all your aims and when I say your imes I'm talking about I'm this and I'm that I can do this and I can do this oh yeah I did this last year oh I can do that oh I'm better than him so all those times it's egos [Music] there's a lot of people in South Africa both black and white who carry the Eagle page on them and they carry it high as a flag you see and and those are the people who we would see as the future bureaucrats of the country if you are driving into a poor neighborhood where you know people are starving to death and you're driving down with your mercedes-benz or your rolls-royce that is the worst thing you could ever do driving with this ego to say I'm better than you you know you'll never be where I am those people are lost [Music] then each terminal if I believe I have to assert my ego the only way I can do that is through greedier I'm forced to constantly cooperate something into myself that lends stability to my ego those can be material things but they can also be spiritual things for example ideas like I'm important for example or and somebody due to money or fame of my title or something like that our entire modern world is based on this here for the picnic green destroys people's of the earth why because it isolates us and because greed is something like a drug you know I have a more I want to have because whatever I have no longer satisfies me so it's not what I actually possess that satisfies me it's the constant striving for more religion has known for centuries that this drive lies within us humans but this drive is also our ruin a playlist [Laughter] [Music] since time immemorial there have been stories of people who could never get enough people like King Midas he asked Diana says to grant him a wish but everything he touched would turn to gold but even his food and his drink turned to gold it seemed he might starve or die of thirst gold and riches have always been cast under the spell of omnipotence and a whisper of eternity what I ask myself gives money such a powerful allure [Laughter] the coupla poof's coming out Spanky Karev I chose banking as my career I'm a trained accountant and I worked with the Ullaeus bear & Co our gay bank first in Zurich I on the Cayman Islands which is a tax haven job I was promoted to compliance officer waning I was the legal conscience of the company name ins [Music] ina give me security a certain amount of greed is instilled into you that was true for me too I have to imagine you start to think only in monetary units I think what dollar signs appear before your eyes and in your heart then they're there and they're the only thing that matters feed poor feed a lot of profit and making sure you don't get caught bands the way I operate out to the course in minor functionals in my function as compliance officer I determined that we had criminal clients tombi been lower names like bin Laden I was a Mexican drug box it became clear to me that I was working for a criminal organization and that the bank was a participant in tax evasion and fraud we 12 industry hint at some of the talk I ended up feeling morally and hunted given took the matter up with management McDonagh management Anjali evolve it or we were threatened the entire family ended up leaving the Cayman Islands very suddenly try to bank had been Swiss bankers in the Cayman Islands who have been killed their house key custom suits to an extent my decision to leave the system was a moral issue but what was more important I think was that I realized the system had turned against me theme Keegan for example the threats that were made against me in the Cayman Islands the way I was fired and then threatened again the bank would destroy me if I tried to file charges against them on Tiger where the dog fell on the rocky bank the bank sent private detectives after us I was followed on my way to work I had to change the route I took to work change my workout is the site of a black car would upset me I was completely smoked I even considered suicide I wanted to drive me crazy they involved in pipe these darts and volkov top estate prosecutors had all the information but they did nothing with it but the son Pony it's a politically but it would make the criminal clients uneasy they would realize they're no longer safe and protected either so with that in mind the authorities don't go after the bank without the bonk they go after the man who made the truth public laws they're evolved tightly I spent 217 days in prison the first 30 days were in 2005 the rest in 2011 by those times I was in solitary confinement spending 23 hours a day alone in my south there were prisoners who flipped rapidly started banging against the doors screaming this right sort of Switzerland and basically every country they protect their golden calves the golden calf in Switzerland is banking secrecy that's why no one had ever investigate the Yuliya spare Bank even though the state prosecutors know that yulia's bear might help deceive the US tax authorities so forth for political reasons the state prosecutors who never investigate we could be a flower question was how could we create test conditions that would approximate the behavior of a stockbroker for example our loss Meteor functional and magnificent we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activity in our test subjects it is currency 9 we can look deep into the brain without including into the structures responsible for the reward response our subjects play a stock trading game and have to decide whether they want to invest a large amount of money or a small amount then they get feedback during the game as to whether the share price is rising or falling we've been able to determine that people who are especially greedy they display a more muted response in regions responsible for punishment and loss of money this mechanism enables a kind of disinhibition I'm making this monster an art in Tamil under their Quinta naama bay ston the assumption that ordinary and average people will be risk averse is that it makes sense for the finance industry which is optimized for outcome to hire people who are more inclined toward risk yeah R Biden they achieved that with bonuses and with targeted hiring practices an efficiently person allows five Flaubert dozen I believe it's just a matter of time before the next finance crisis will hit [Music] yeah we'll watch it Jeanette okay tonight what in exchange what you did great okay thank you very much [Music] when I started hearing about Warren Buffett's and Bill Gates worth it was run about the 3040 billions but now it's 70 billion you know in life if you have only a billion dollars you can be able to leave for 273 years and eat or spend ten thousand dollars a day how many of us live for 233 years so if you have got a billion that means you can even spend thirty thousand a day because you're not gonna last that long but still other people make much more you know nobody can say I don't want more if people like me don't make money there is no taxes that enables government to function so therefore people who make money enable things to happen and I'm all of those people [Music] more growth more affluence more contentment this is the promise of those who mean well with us and we're only too happy to believe them we do our part are we hoping to buy ourselves happiness many Western Europeans and Americans they no longer really have a firm belief in God but you have to believe in something you know we have these belief systems that reduce death anxiety but there's always going to be a rumble of panic beneath the surface of consciousness we're gonna take this death anxiety and we got to do something with it and one thing that we can do is by oddish [Music] by the time you can talk you have already been pelted with commercial images like the Nike check and the golden arches we know them subliminally [Music] our children are growing up in a world that is radically different from the ones that you and I grew up and their brains have been modified accordingly manufacturers of consumer goods they are spending literally billions of dollars to ensure that no child is left behind in the commercial rat race we're basically in a sense no different than amoebas we are attracted to anything that fosters life and pleasure and we're repulsed and afraid of anything that threatens that state of affairs shoes shoes and their shoes everywhere shoes sometimes you don't want to let go of something you keep it for instance this shoe I've never won it but I think it's been sitting here for like prayers still brand new and it's the same thing with this one still brand new that's one still brand new this is a designer shoe I don't want to be limited because in in the Bible Genesis says you must have dominion over everything that gives me that strength nobody in the Bible I can open it for you nobody is poor Abraham Moses everybody he's a rich man in the bible bible does not talk about poverty the Bible is the biggest money machine everywhere each verse talks about money that is something that people need to realize and I'm happy that there's something like this I think the key for the material society is that it will always tell you that there's something missing you need something else we're all contributing I don't think it's only the you know you can't just blame someone who's trying to sell you something so demand and supply you know we're all sort of supporting each other in it and we've all gotten into this cycle that we are unable to find ourselves free from [Music] talking about 24 hours I would say 23 hours and 55 minutes samsara is saying come you're missing something and by samsara I mean the habitual patterns and you keep thinking they're calling me samsara is calling I need to go there have a car have a house have a partner be busy be neurotic that's what I would say of course you don't call it that way you call it being someone being capable finding your identity [Music] whether it's discontentment you're always looking for more you're always looking for more that struggle brings about so much insecurity and unhappiness [Music] one of the reasons why people acquire so much is because it feels good there are both neurochemical and psychological feedback loops it causes you to continue doing it well beyond what you actually need it's one thing when you go out and I can get a cup of cool warm coffee on a cold rainy day it's completely another thing when you buy a you know 75th pair of shoes you really really don't in any stretch of the imagination need those shoes but they're still gonna make you feel good there is this drive to as we say in the u.s. keep up with the Joneses in our wealthy set on in Park Avenue everybody's 16th birthday party last year everybody handed out iPods well this year we're gonna hand out iPads well this year we're gonna do this and so there's also this sort of ratchet effect there's nothing wrong with being a consumer I mean to stay alive we have to consume things but that we literally surrounded ourselves with stuff to the point where we become imprisoned in a gilded cage we became consumed with consumption we gonna keep buying stuff until the last drop of petroleum has been burnt [Music] a Flemish proverb holds the world is a haystack and each man plucks from it what he can we humans wish to have to possess but the question is can we have anything without taking it away from someone else [Music] in 1657 the Portuguese came through Mozambique they were the first people to be here exploiting gold Africa is like a thumb so anybody who sets himself up somewhere it would just extract the minerals and take them away you can imagine a country ten times bigger than the map was colorized by one person in Belgium who called it is from this was absolutely unfair on the African continent [Music] that's it you stand by principle we have the right to ownership of our resources our land policy was right the man has done a lot for me Mugabe ensured that the masses got land which they got for free and they are producing we may not have kicked off or at the best of how things should be but people are catching up and that particular movie met people must be equal must be treated equally all of them [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] when the Christian missionaries got to Africa how long had the Africans been there forever they were the first humans and when they got there did they say oh we would like to learn about the customs that you have used for hundreds of thousands of years what did they say you're Catholic now or we kill you all right so they just said we are the best the rest stop doing that and you're Catholic now let's play bingo [Applause] in the back of our head we know that the current Western approach to life requires that we directly and indirectly take advantage of other people's war and stuff go together and they always have our ability to consume wanton Li requires the involuntary subjugation of large swatches of the rest of the world you cannot be an American in less you can have a banana anytime you want it or coffee anytime want it well for that to happen I need people to grow bananas and I need people to grow coffee and they may like to have something else besides banana and coffee but we're just gonna send our military and install our businesses there instead the military and the leaders of the fortune 500 companies are literally and symbolically inextricably connected [Applause] this whole place is full of minerals you know so yeah I want to take you down so that you can see the David Livingstone the man who discovered this force we can say doing business this colonialism if the Americans the British the Germans take away their money Chinese man amass c'mere a Russian man I'm askin the thing is if we do not have capital as big as the one the Chinese are bringing into Africa we will not be able to exploit those minerals and should we created arrogancy towards money to say that exploitation only happens in Africa is wrong most European countries have got slaves even in Europe America there's two people who take people illegally keep them and keep them as slaves and are using them pimping them and all sorts of things so that must go because it isn't the right you know thing to do the on on a human being regardless of what kind of bondage you are in you can break that bondage [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] in the biblical story of Babel mankind wanted to build a tower that would reach to the heavens God punished its bride by creating a confusion of languages the Tower of Babel the ultimate symbol of self-indulgence and excess when humans aspired to be gods of bad things happen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] who'd of Emma had a nose at funerals in 1994 who - Velma started working for the barre banking establishment he soon discovered some strange things and tried to speak with management about them the dark stiff it was above board but the bear management weren't all too pleased about that would it and he was fired and then he became a whistleblower passing on a CV tax data to the Swiss tax authorities he figured they'd take action given dimensions and find somebody a house in victory but offshore to be ninja players like to talk about fall shoring today offshoring I mean not only tax havens but also what I call havens of collusion and concealment this is Ugland house in the Cayman Islands the registered address for nineteen thousand different companies as President Obama said neither it's the biggest building in the world the biggest tax scam well it's not the biggest houses Disney current estimates say about 21 or maybe 31 and billion US dollars are hidden offshore offshore fistic say Joe behind I'm afraid because I was part of this sister and I know how these people end up the some ancient sister named tweak on their path is strewn with corpses is imagine Gare de Lyon he's been a gay ignore might become an opponent of capitalism because I see what terrible things it's done to the world the West has embraced itself at the expense of third-world countries on a massive scale or thief in a manner that I believe is contrary to all humanity Giga near the mention CAI que tu - office the arrogant those who currently hold power will use every means of their disposal to ensure the system remains in place unchanged fish day until us be as high tastes the hubris of the lords of Finance is explicable in a few ways one is that we have the highest regard for people who appear to have the capacity to generate infinite amounts of money I think another reason that we venerate them is that it just appears to be magic money makers make money out of making money and then finally I just think money has become the new God and kind of a secular universe [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm not saying people shouldn't be rich you work hard to get there and it's your right but there are those who don't actually care they just take and take and it causes problems when we have the Kings who are running the world from their palaces they knew the value of gold the more I have of this the more I could have of whatever I want and that's how it grows and they'll make sure that the poorer people gets poorer we saw that back then and we starting to see today again I don't need a Lamborghini I don't need a mansion I just need simple things like hi hi talk talk you can't live a life without money and you can't live life without love because you have to love other people so that they can love you back and you're to it to make to have man so that you can give life they were the way you want it politicians most of them are greedy because they say especially heinous or Africa there's a lot of corruption yeah [Music] poor people who are surrounded by poor people for the most part they're not depressed it's when there's poverty juxtaposed with inordinate riches that's what fosters depression and unwellness there are people who say this is a good thing that self-interested people acquiring as much as they can or that they would like the rising tide lifts all boats then some people are gonna have more that's fine well the counterpoint though is that I don't think it is fine [Music] [Music] I wonder is mankind perhaps not an error of evolution nature is bizarre experiment on a small blue planet are we really mentally incapable of looking ahead [Music] there's been any number of great civilizations the Aztecs the Incas that have from time to time imploded on themselves if you look back historically at societies that have collapsed they often do so right after they appeared to be at their most auspicious moment if we think we can just keep increasing the number of humans on

"he planet and provide each of them with the lifestyle that we in the West currently enjoy without turning the earth into a humanely uninhabited smoldering heap I think we're deluding ourselves our frenzied desire for infinite amounts of stuff will have the paradoxical consequence of being the first form of life to be responsible for our own extinction it's very ominous I would argue [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] this is a ground zero for climate change for this is where we can get closest to the big ice and this is why it's happening in 1978 as a runner for the elders I gave a talk at the nominations that the big ice is melting so when I finished I got the standing ovation and and then they say that that love is a well-spoken young eskimo for nobody heard the message whoever go be in India in South Africa in Tokyo in Hong Kong in Rio de Janeiro New York Copenhagen Paris Berlin [Music] no matter where go nobody cheats nobody [Music] at the time of my birth this ice was only averaged 5 kilometers thick but now on the average will be about 2 kilometers that means 3 kilometers of ice is melted when it gets warmer and it is getting warmer every single day with one Celsius the water will literally expand more than 2 meters handbook is only 75 centimeters above the sea level London is less than a meter as well I wanted you to see these big eyes to feel her energy [Music] this big ice on the top of the world carries a wisdom because everything what happens on mother earth will end up in the North hemisphere for in the antarctica south hemisphere we drive on tires made of rubber but addabani lost eating rubber so all that tiny pieces of rubber had to go somewhere so the wind would catch it and he goes off to the jet stream and the end here and it becomes too heavy here they fall down a snore but when the Sun comes back rubber loves Sun so it melts the ice only faces only figures is telling you something [Music] mankind is like a teenager they don't care about what's going to happen tomorrow this big ice will melt in your lifetime you before you become all like me most of this one will be gone catastrophe is on its way catastrophe you and I we cannot even imagine water will always win [Applause] [Music] Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans in punishment Zeus created the seductive Pandora and gave her a box as a gift even though she had been warned not to bend or opened the box and all the evils of the world escaped only hope was left inside the [Music] human race we have a tremendously decent track record so far of extra cating ourselves from profound difficulties once we understand what produces them we have to evaluate all values is this important to me because I'm a cultural meat puppet that's just having my strengths pulled by the society at large or have I really systematically questioned what I want and why I do what I do [Music] so you either give up and despair and do nothing or you do something and you do it with passion and conviction [Music] [Music] the cult of les was a project that I started for myself to try to get rid of everything that I owned because I found that the more things I owned the less happy I was [Music] as I was traveling I noticed that I didn't really miss all of the things I had owned when I got back I couldn't really tell you you know what those things were so rather than continuing to keep them I decided to get rid of those things the cult of les was like a website that I put together and I listed everything that I owned at the time and I put a description next to it and a price tag and then over the course of about a year I sold all that stuff with the goal of trying to get everything down into two boxes and two suitcases [Music] and kind of my rule was if I couldn't remember kind of the last time that I used something I would get rid of it I find myself not worrying so much about what I'm going to buy next but more like what I'm going to do next or where I'm going to go next [Music] the idea of minimalism manifests itself in our work in a lot of ways but mostly I guess what we're known for is really how our product looks [Music] sustainable growth is good because that implies that the thing that you're building into the world is replacing something that is obsolete and it does it better and more efficiently whereas unsustainable growth in a lot of ways is something that is often very toxic to the market or to a lifestyle to me wealth isn't just measured by what you own or how much money is in your bank account it can also be having experienced a lot in your life I think it's very important for even having some very solid relationships with your friends like there's nothing better than a good friendship and it makes a lot more sense to invest in that than it would be to invest a new couch for your living room or anything like that it's very difficult to describe when something just feels right but that felt very right for myself [Music] [Music] if somebody could take one clever use in every country in this world a person who's got vision a person who is honest if every president of every government could say for one day get someone out of the society to be a president for their country just forward that one day it could make a big difference [Applause] the manifesto of the world in order for us the three billion youth of the planet the climate crisis is a matter of survival you world leaders have known about the climate catastrophe for 25 years we cannot simply sit back and watch let us work together the climate clock is ticking the main problem of this planet is the mindset people know the consequences of what can happen what they do people know what is right in people who know what is wrong and still they don't do the right thing I want to ask why so it makes me both angry and sad like I'm a you know I'm a human being too like why can't you listen to my decisions about my life like who appointed you ruler the world and allowed you to decide to take away my future so we're now here because we're frustrated and we want to make sure this gets done but just never straight what [Music] in Malawi more than 70% died young people so kind of like okay if they if young people we don't act now then when is it going to be the right time in Hong Kong there is there are a lot of youth teenagers they start to think to change their society by their own Mexico for example has large petroleum reserves because the politicians are only interested in the money they're exploiting the ocean and don't care that it's being polluted by oil and that species are dying out they don't care as long as they make a profit but the Mexican people aren't profiting from it at all oh no no legaia nada they'll keep getting and getting and that's what greed is born people are confused and they don't understand so if they were come somewhere else and they were to be taught something different they could probably step out of that and then look back at how their life wasn't be like oh my god if like my life was not actually that good even though I have all this stuff [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the choices we all make I speak for those that stand by and say this is my continent it's not too late the time has come we'll go fight and make a difference [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if mankind is truly the crown of creation and also comprehends his own impermanence where does this endless desire come from what about the saying you can't take it with you [Music] everything in my life had been going pretty normally my work as a neurosurgeon and all that and then I woke up at 4:30 in the morning with severe back pain and soon thereafter had grand mal epileptic seizures and was driven into coma and then I was taken to the hospital and at that point they determined that I had a severe and very rare form of a gram-negative bacterium meningitis that destroys the neocortex the part that is responsible for all the detailed awareness in our consciousness when I first got in the hospital I had a 10% chance of survival by the end of the week in Qom I was down to a 2% chance of survival no chance of recovery it's a perfect model for human death and yet it was more like the blinders coming off so when I came back to this world on day seven all of my memories of Evan Alexander's life before coma were completely gone all language any concepts of humans earth this universe any knowing of the beings around me you know my mother my sisters my sons I had no clue who these beings were before my car I was very much a modern conventional scientist what's called reductive materialist the journeying soul who comes back from the near-death experience knows there is nothing to fear about death it is actually an awakening to a far grander existence that is who we truly are and that changes the way one can see oneself and how one self then interacts with other beings I would say that any perception of of greed and selfishness and accumulation of material goods in this material realm is really a symptom of fear a fear that we in and of ourselves are not worthy and so we try and accumulate physical goods and kind of build up our little pile as if that will draw people to us or draw that love that we deeply want it's a bottomless pit we've separated ourselves from the phenomenon of death [Music] anytime death is on our mind there's a process that kicks in to get it out of consciousness my wife is a therapist in the local hospice and she says look you have to sit with deaf it takes courage to say this entity that is me and was here yesterday and is here today may not be here tomorrow and will not be here in some vaguely unspecified future that that takes takes some guts [Music] we're just starting to study what happens to older people as they become more aware of death some people become wiser become more compassionate and now the trick is how do we metaphorically speaking pop that in a bottle and get young adults to start drinking it I'm very much afraid of my own death [Music] I'd having said that though I would like to think that I'm making slow but steady progress to coming to terms with the fact that I will someday die it is something that I don't look forward to at the moment let me leave a bit and make more money and let it visit me at some point with my little cousins and grandchildren are you know growing up so I need time before that [Music] it can happen anytime one minute you hear the next minute you've gone [Music] do you have to go to the school of anxiety in order to ever become a mature human being if we could accept with grace and humility the fact that were finite creatures we need to do that we need to let go humans appear to be the only creatures from existence without purpose is meaningless I believe there are two exceptional days in every life the day we are born and the day on which we understand our purpose what is important what is essential what do you live for I think happiness is vastly overrated being happy is not unimportant but happiness in and of itself does not ensure that life is meaningful it does not stop us from tranquilizing ourselves with the trivial [Music] if you're just out to be happy there's a lot of ways to do that but it doesn't render you any more mature and it certainly doesn't render you in a position to sincerely confront the fact that you're an ephemeral entity destined to die I would argue that there's got to be more than two life than the singular pursuit of happiness you need some stuff you know I like shoes and my bicycle in my house but I'm still with Mary Poppins in the long run enough is as good as a feast to me oftentimes happiness is found in the things that you didn't expect to find positive so just to give you an example recently one evening I was out with my kids we've taken a walk to the park and we were walking home and we've had lots of what we call fireflies lightning bugs little bugs that light up in the evening and so we spent 45 happy minutes catching fireflies we played with them for a while before we let them go it's those quiet moments but everything seems to be working well together you're enjoying the people you're with you're enjoying the activity you're doing and oftentimes it's found in those situations that you can't buy yummy - Gucci oh gosh Buddhism flourishes best wherever there is a society of people who have cost materialism and consumerism found it to not be the answer of happiness and peace and perhaps that will be the first gate that opens them up to finding answers not on the external but finding much more answers within one's own self you're always on the driver's seat and therefore you can choose to drive straight or you can choose to drive wrong and so your own awareness your own potential of being mindful is much more powerful I think happiness is found where there is inner contentment simplicity and contentment [Music] your money will not impress anybody how many bags you carry from a shopping center will not impress what kind of car you drive is not going to impress or will make the difference is what you bring from new in your heart into the world and I wanted to give you an experience which directly relates to the celebration of life [Music] [Music] I don't know if you can feel the energy this is a Midnight Sun and this is a full moon completely opposite of one another Oh No Oh Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Marnie neo [Music] life is a ceremony in itself so you had to recreate your ceremony to celebrate your life uh-huh that's the key for the chains there's no other key are there solutions I hope so greed is a complicated ally of motivational forces that has driven creativity innovation and discovery on the other hand with each uniquely human innovation there's been an unanticipated downside it is a blessing and a curse we're probably the first species to run into the problem and evolution doesn't create solutions to problems that don't exist evolution is blind evolution doesn't plan for the future evolution doesn't worry about moral consequences we have moral principles and we all know them but we don't live by them anymore that is our problem we need to listen that's not always easy to understand that every action of my body my speech and my thought patterns interconnect and impact the lives of the others if that genuine sense of awareness could be developed human life could be and is the most powerful and the most beautiful gift for everyone I like how Albert Camus put it in one of his notebooks come to terms with death thereafter anything is possible [Music] this is what my mother would do she says oh oh Oh [Music] some imaginative but thou is it formal Oh Elizabeth sure would be charged with adoption novel [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]

54,0,Melting ice – the future of the Arctic | DW Documentary,"Climate change in the Arctic is fueling not only fear, but also hope. Sea levels will rise and flood many regions. But the melting ice will also expose new land with reserves of oil, gas and minerals. New sea routes are also emerging.The melting of the ice in the far north has given reason for great optimism, as newly-found mineral resources promise the Inuit a better life. But international corporations and self-proclaimed 'partners' such as China also have their eye on the treasures of the Arctic. Some even dream of a polar Silk Road. As large corporations position themselves to exploit the treasures of the far north, the indigenous people, the Inuit, are fighting for their independence. Our film team spent four weeks with a geological expedition to the north coast of Canada - a place where no human has ever set foot before - and were present at the geologists world’s northernmost spring. A microbiologist with them also collected DNA samples that could help in the development of new vaccines against resistant germs. However, the most important resource in the far north is still fish: Greenland supplies half the world with it, yet it still doesn’t bring in enough to finance necessary investments in its underdeveloped infrastructure. And in Canada, the Inuit are also struggling with their government for the right to share in the wealth of their own land.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Documentary,U0aNeYZL8jY,"[""[Music] the Arctic is often described as a vast expanse of eternal ice but in some parts of the region that's no longer the case [Music] this is Ellis Muir Island in the Canadian Arctic this strip of coastline was once covered with ice but the nearby glaciers are melting so we can see more and more of the land that lies beneath them some researchers predict starting in 2050 the Arctic will be ice-free in summer so what will happen to the region is all that ice melts this will lead to almost 2 meters rise in sea levels all over the world the Arctic helps to determine the climate for a much wider area including parts of the u.s. future climate change due to the ice retrieving the world map is being rewritten with the Arctic in the center that will cause massive changes here and in other parts of the world I think it's the biggest challenge facing the whole world in the future [Music] a challenge or an opportunity during the summer after the ice has melted vegetation blooms along the coastline animal bones indicate that wildlife has returned [Music] more and more scientists are coming to the region in several countries have claimed mining rights how will those rights be allocated geologists can now study land that used to be covered in ice land that is rich in natural resources the competition for this Arctic treasure is fierce these resources include oil natural gas and rare earth elements taken together they're worth trillions of dollars the indigenous peoples who live in the Arctic region say they deserve a share of these riches new sources of income would help them improve their lives and have more of a say in government policies that affect them [Music] these scientists will be the first to study a particularly remote part of Arctic Canada that feels great you know after days are waiting and then you get ready to go on the field we got close twice and now we're getting on that's excellent right let's see what awaits it'll probably be a bumpy ride because of bad weather more than a century ago Arctic expeditions led by Umberto Nabila and Alfred Vigna made headlines around the world today research trips to the region are not nearly as demanding as they used to be but they are expensive about 15,000 euros per person [Music] [Music] resolute Bay is often used as a starting point for scientific expeditions in the 1950s the Canadian government forced indigenous people from northern Quebec to settle in this remote but strategically important region Susan Sullivan ik was a child at the time [Music] there has been a lot of scientists that have come up here and I guess there are more now I'm expecting that there'll be a lot more people coming up north to find out more about vegetation or things that were frozen that are trying [Music] July 1st is Canada Day the country's national holiday but the local Inuit residents don't have much to celebrate the village of resolute Bay needs more jobs schools and hospitals the inuit want more financial support from the canadian government they also demand more autonomy so that they can live according to their traditional values Susan Sullivan ik hopes that her grandchildren will be able to lead better lives than she and her parents did she says that the Canadian government should formally apologized for the forced resettlement of the Inuit people and provide better jobs and job training programs [Music] for young people they are today there are so many more possibilities for them to get proper education and we hope that we'll see within the 10 20 years that they'll be an in abductor we now have lawyers we now have well nurses that are Inuit but we need more in with in the professional system the Arctic region includes parts of five countries [Music] Denmark Norway Russia the USA and Canada in 1999 the Canadian government created a new Northern Territory called Nunavut which means our land summer has arrived in Nunavut but it's still cold just three degrees centigrade the researchers arrived from resolute Bay they'll spend two months on the territories north coast there are no settlements here and no roads either there's not a lot of vegetation because the tundra subsoil is permanently frozen the scientists set up their camp and it's anything but luxurious their only connection to the outside world are the transport helicopters this expedition is financed by the governments of Canada and Germany Germany has invested a lot of money in Arctic research and will continue to do so I think it's very important as we continue to study the effects of global warming we need to find out more about how the entire climate system functions in the descansar clima vdz gansan processor force union Carsten pipian is a geologist who works for Germany's Institute for geo Sciences and Natural Resources which is part of the Federal Ministry of economics and technology there are scientists here from several other countries as you can see from these flags Stevan grass pee is a geochemist who works for Canada's department of energy and environment his work here will focus on the composition of rocks American biologist John Speer will study microbes that could be used in research on antibiotic resistant bacteria so right these are each one of these little green tough tubes is $15 each and they are for extracting DNA out of samples so I'll collect like a little bit of a pencil eraser sized amount of material and I will insert it into these tubes and we'll shake it around I'll take it home and we'll extract DNA out of it at home [Applause] the weather is good today so the scientists head out to do some work when these mountains were formed millions of years ago the local environment looked much different there was no ice cover and the land was covered with plants and trees geologists take a long-term view of life on earth they think in terms of millennia not centuries and many scientists believe that today we are living in the final stages of the most recent Ice Age [Music] Stephen grasp II discovered some unusual vegetation on a mountainside recently and now he's come back to take a closer look there's a freshwater spring here a rare occurrence in this part of the Arctic the topsoil thaw is only in the summertime grass B speculates on the origins of the spring we're finding more and more different areas with Springs and we're able to record the temperatures we've left data loggers in the springs through the winter and we can see that they flow all winter long so it turns out that these very high latitude arctic regions is actually some areas of very active groundwater flow and it challenges all our conceptions as to what's happening and it really tells us we we don't know as much as we thought we did so it's exciting because new things to learn the researchers have dug this the ice spring it continues to flow even in winter when the temperature is minus 40 degrees centigrade the water temperature at that time is six degrees Speier captures a thermal image of the spring before the team heads back to camp geologist Victoria Pease specializes in the study of plate tectonics the movement of parts of the Earth's crust she's been doing research in the Arctic for twenty years and also teaches at the University of Stockholm today she's working with a colleague from Canada [Music] [Music] [Music] in the Arctic as a whole in the global warming de-icing framework of climate today industry not just petroleum but other economic resources fishing shipping transportation mining oil and gas are all interested in accessing what they perceive to be a new reservoir a new region right and I would say that the industry side of things are very interested in the Arctic what's going on here and how they may be able to capitalize on ice-free conditions in the Arctic some experts speculate that the melting of the Arctic ice may open up new shipping routes between Asia and Europe that could have substantial strategic and economic benefits for several countries including China we believe that China do have a role to play in seeking peace and stability in that region and in promoting accessibility sustainable development in the RT area Chinese government issued a white paper on the Arctic policy in which the polar Silk Road has been officially announced as a policy of the Chinese government and you can see the northern sea routes have become commercially feasible after years of a celebrated melting of ice in the Artic region China aims to create a new Silk Road trade route that would run from Asia to Europe via the North Pole right now China has to move its exports to Europe through the Indian Ocean the proposed new Arctic roof would cut shipping time by 20% or about two weeks some experts say that China also wants access to the Arctic's rich supply of natural resources the growing Chinese middle class is basically screaming for resources from all over the planet and and and and the Arctic is no exception so what you see is basically the same interest for resources as China have in South America and as China have in Africa and and you can also I think see that China moves in in the places where United States is not present or where United States pulls out then you see China pulls in and we also start to see that in the Arctic meanwhile back in Arctic Canada Victoria Pease prepares to fly back to camp the research that she and her colleagues are doing here could be used by any number of countries the scientists have no control over where their data ends up and that's fine with Victoria [Music] I look at the tectonic environment where rocks form and that information is useful to the industry and what they do with it is beyond me this research work is difficult time-consuming and expensive it's not yet clear on the government's and businesses that are funding these projects we'll make use of all the data but if they have a strategic interest in the Arctic after the ice they'll have to start preparing now I just start with some materials from the Franklin Basin these researchers at Germany's Institute for geosciences and natural resources in Hanover are going to analyze some rock samples that were taken off the coast of western Greenland they've got a lot of work ahead of them first they'll cut away a slice of rock that's just 30 microns thick about the same width as a sheet of paper then they'll examine it under a microscope my calendars Jesus Christus this sample is almost transparent it's thinner than a single human hair that will allow us to examine in detail how this material interacts with light and that will help us identify the individual minerals that are contained in this sample current video incentive in AHA lead and if it's here we return to Nunavut the local residents sometimes find jobs helping the foreign research teams several countries have a vested interest in exploiting the region's natural resources and the scientists research may help them to do that the Inuit hope that is the Arctic ice continues to melt they'll be able to share in the economic benefits and have more of a say in how they live their lives over the centuries the Inuit have proven that they can adapt to even the harshest climate conditions but they're tired of living in primitive dwellings and eating only the meat and fish that nature provides as their ancestors did before them this is Greenland's capital nuke located on the southwest coast Greenland has been part of Denmark since 1814 but now enjoys a great deal of autonomy still subsidy payments from Denmark make up about 60% of the territory's budget the capital is in the middle of a construction boom as Greenland gains more control over the allocation of revenues generated by the exploitation of natural resources we want to diversify our economy in terms of generating new income sources for our country we see the mining as as a future income source along with tourism along with other industries that we are trying to attract to Greenland so there is a consideration of making our economy less vulnerable for rapid there or something changes official the fishing industry is a key element in Greenland's economy fish and shellfish make up about 90% of total exports and as much as 20% of GDP Greenland left the European Economic Community in 1985 in a dispute over fishing policy part of today's catch is being unloaded at the part of nuke Maalik Olson works for Royal Greenland the territory's largest fishing company it has more than 40 processing facilities in Greenland and also on Canada's Atlantic coast the company headquarters are located here in nuke the most important fish or shellfish is shrimp for Greenland I think it has a good price in the international market so it's a good species to have at the moment our main suppliers are the local fishermen in for the near coastal fishery so there are approximately 3,000 people fishermen delivering the fish for our factories and besides that we have a lot of trawlers that are fishing in in the sea Royal Greenland also operates its own fleet of fishing vessels one of them is just come into port Manik Olson meets the captain the ship was at sea for two weeks and brought in 250 tons of fish the catch was immediately frozen on board this is the cooling facility the temperature is minus 25 degrees centigrade each bag contains 30 kilos of cod some scientists predict the climate change will force large numbers of fish and shellfish to move north into colder water in addition there are indications that the area off Greenland's coast is being overfished Moloch has seen that happen before the cut is a species that is coming back back in the 80s there was a lot of a lot of cut in the Greenlandic sea but suddenly it disappeared so there hasn't been cut fishing in the last 20 years in Greenland so it's its first the last years that it started to come back after the trawler unloads its catch it goes back out to sea the market for fish and fish products is good right now sales and prices are rising still the fishing industry does not generate enough revenue to support Greenland's entire economy on its own so the territory will have to find new sources of income at the moment the fishery is not cannot alone maintain this economy for Greenland so we have to welcome some new businesses in in Greenland tourism is one of the things that the politicians are talking about and and there we have to develop new businesses to to gain some more economic growth in Greenland [Music] Greenland is one of Europe's most remote tourist destinations but visitors are not attracted by luxury hotels or wellness facilities there are none here they have come to see the territories breathtaking natural beauty those who are looking for a unique travel experience will find it here there are ruins of Viking settlements [Music] the Northern Lights and Arctic wildlife including reindeer these vast landscapes are populated by more than 20 species of mammals and dozens of bird species [Music] but Greenland is an expensive place to visit food prices are high mostly because supplies have to be imported the infrastructure needs a lot of work only small planes can land at the airport in Newark the runway is too short for large commercial passenger jets greenland's government is trying to line up foreign investors who will help finance improvements high on the list of potential partners are Chinese businesses I'm not afraid of China in general I think China as as a market for commodities and and metals and minerals is an important investment country last year a company owned by the Chinese government submitted a bid for the expansion of three small airports in Greenland but the government in Denmark stepped in and blocked the bid citing security and financial concerns in any case Greenland needs to make a serious effort to improve its infrastructure definitely the the logistics are very difficult Greenland is far away from both Europe and North America it's a very big island the biggest island in the world spread out over a very large area so definitely logistical challenges and also environmental challenges in forms in form of bad weather in large parts of Greenland many people earn a living by hunting one of them is Tobias ignites Yuson who lives in Tazi Locke on the southeast coast during the summer he goes hunting every week in the winter months he catches fish this is the only way that he can provide food for his family it's new popping up my father and brothers taught me how to hunt I no longer alive so now I'll go by myself Benny I heard it my family lives on the meat all the fish that I bring back so far we've always had enough to eat we've never gone hungry I made sure of that Tobias and his family eat reindeer and musk ox meat at summer and in winter mostly seals and narwhals a small species of whale [Music] Tobias is not concerned that the Arctic ice is melting he's learned to adapt to his environment Tobias often takes along foreign tourists on his hunting trips the extra income has allowed him to buy a few luxuries like a snowmobile and an outboard motor for his boat been out doing it be out okay we can't grow vegetables here we can only eat what nature provides and we don't waste any food if we don't eat it right away we'll freeze it and store it either killing them weeping on top top those who prefer to buy their food instead of hunting or fishing for it can shop at the supermarket's into Zoellick but the food in the shops is expensive because a lot of it has to be imported mostly from Europe some food supplies are brought in by helicopter [Music] there aren't many trees in Greenland only a few species are able to grow here mostly in the far south but that may change because of global warming during the summer some crops are grown in the south as legend has it the region was given the name Greenland by a tenth century Norse explorer he hoped that a pleasant sounding name would attract settlers [Music] the residents of tezi lakh would love to grow vegetables here in the summer and that may happen if the Arctic ice continues to melt two thousand people live in two Zoellick it's the largest town in southeastern Greenland but behind the colorful facades of these homes many people suffer from depression and alcoholism the community only recently started to discuss these problems openly the causes include the town's high unemployment rate and the poverty that goes along with it domestic abuse is common the suicide rate among young men is high and during the winter the bodies can't be buried because the ground is frozen [Music] [Music] the local mortuary is located next to a church the bodies are kept here until spring many local residents simply have not been able to cope with the transition from a semi-nomadic eco centered culture to a modern society that's based on commerce and consumerism some are frustrated by the presence of wealthy tourists when they themselves can't find a job there's no need to go hunting anymore when you can just buy food at the supermarket many people have ended up on welfare [Music] [Applause] [Music] every family in Greenland knows the pain of the social problems that we are seeing in the statistics and they are quite high I mean it's both suicides and as I said we do see a lot of violence as well and violence against women and children and this is something that we need to fix and I think we need to fix it within the next generation or otherwise it will be every every family is being affected by this three four times over we have to stop it now Tilly Martinez son is a member of Greenland's Parliament and has been speaking out on these problems she's half Inuit and half Danish she believes that Greenland should maintain close ties to Denmark because she fears that the indigenous peoples will not be able to survive on their own politician aleko Hammond also hopes for a better future for Greenland but she believes that this will only happen if the territory wins its independence from Denmark I have a Danish passport but that's all I am not Danish I don't think Danish I don't speak Danish at home I don't feel like a Dane and I don't feel like at home when I'm in Denmark [Music] Greenland continues to move toward independence from Denmark and today even young Inuit children learned to take pride in their traditional culture their language and their homeland [Music] a lot of people around the world are definitely concerned about the effects of global warming but Benny and Greenland see these environmental changes as an opportunity to free themselves from foreign influence many of the European immigrants who helped build this territory are buried in the cemetery independence is a question of what society that we want in the future for the people of Greenland independence is a question of the freedom of the choices the government of Greenland should be doing in regards to the Foreign Affairs in terms of the safety and the military issues connected to Greenland Denmark is responsible for Greenland security and maintains several military bases here but in the near future Greenland will have more control over its defense and foreign policy still some Danes are reluctant to sever ties completely for a number of different reasons the Danish Greenlandic relationship goes back many hundred years so there is there is cultural ties there is historical ties people have married each other there a lot of Greenlanders living in denmark there's a lot of Danish people living in Greenland so so so it's not just you know a matter of pulling the plug and then say from now on we are independent Denmark also understands the importance of maintaining good relations with a territory that is strategically important and rich in natural resources as the competition for those resources intensifies Denmark aims to maintain a security presence there many Danes believe that the government's current policies on Greenland benefits both sides that is where I would argue that that it is difficult to find a better deal if you are looking at the world from a Greenlandic perspective then then being partner with with Denmark and and I would doubt that if you partner up with China or anyone else that there would be no favors asked in return China keeps a close eye on developments in the Arctic from its embassy in Reykjavik Iceland the Ambassador says that the world has nothing to fear from Beijing's trade policies the Chinese government has no intention of a competing with the US side for worldly influence we regard issues based on his merit and also we have a strong wish to develop a good relationship with all the countries as world powers compete for position and influence in Greenland the Inuit people are standing up for their rights when these children grow up they may find themselves living in a country that has won its freedom from Denmark but is heavily dependent on China the Inuits in Canada also want more autonomy some even favor closer ties with Inuit peoples of other countries we were one people before governments were organized and divided as through borders we work with why we work across borders we have always been one in eight we recognize that we know we have rights as it teaches people Oh colic egg easyacc is a former chair of the Inuit circumpolar Council and often speaks out on issues that affect indigenous peoples here she's meeting with an old friend former Nunavut premier Eva re-ack they've set up camp on the outskirts of none of its capital Iqaluit we will never completely lose who we are that's it's not in the picture [Music] [Music] we want to work with our governments and we want to work with the industries that are up here they want to come up here recognize that fact and work with us to your collective benefit I guess every year hundreds of delegates from dozens of countries gather in Reykjavik for the annual Arctic Circle assembly the participants include politicians scientists business executives representatives of indigenous peoples and others who are interested in the future of the Arctic region and how it will be affected by climate change the organization's chairman is former Iceland president Olafur a grim son he says it's important to bring together as many international representatives as possible to discuss policy [Music] the problem for the Arctic is not in the Arctic and it's in the heavily industrialized countries in the world and without putting that in perspective we will never gain a comprehensive understanding of the future of the Arctic the Arctic ice has been rapidly melting now for two decades the process has even affected glaciers in Greenland that are 100,000 years old scientists estimate that 10,000 tons of Arctic ice are lost every second due to global warming but some say that this may turn out to be a positive development summers are getting longer there's vegetation growing I I believe you know there are a lot of all annuity things that have become so I guess it's their prophecy I believe this prophecy as the Arctic ice continues to melt the indigenous people stand to benefit from the exploitation of the region's natural resources and the creation of new trade routes increased prosperity may help them to preserve their natural way of life but as Olaf I goodi'm sand points out the future of the Arctic has become an international issue we are now seeing for the first time in human history the Arctic becoming global inputs the consequences for the rest of the world from what's happening in the Arctic and also how the rest of the world impacts on the Arctic [Music]

55,0,Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,"Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life – and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. The country’s most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin’s major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

country is unknown as it is contradictory is slowly opening up the best way to get to know it is by train women in trouble a lot of memories come back to me I look at everything it's very romantic I enjoy it a lot I'm not in a hurry we start our journey of discovery on the Shatt al-arab the river that forms the border between Iraq and Iran a region that was once hard fought over Abaddon was partially destroyed by the Iraqis during the iran-iraq war today it's a bustling port the station's located in the nearby city of Karim Shah our train stands alone at the platform and we are feeling a little weary and exposed in the name of God dear friends welcome this is a typical train in Iran you can see how diligently our where employees are cleaning it have to be quick so they're done before the departure supposedly German virtues is far away from home maybe a left over from when the railway was first built some sections were constructed by German companies today Iran is one of the few countries in which the railways undergoing a renaissance assigned seating makes the trip stress-free and comfortable our train leaves chorim shah and heads north not far from the Persian Gulf would take the trans Iranian railway on a 1400 kilometer journey to the Caspian Sea the construction of this railway line was once the prestige project of the sheriff Persia a central investment in infrastructure Alysha razor shark add a lot about Iran's economic development but what I am victims admitted then with the one he did a great service to this country by building the railway up - Peter - you know how much to visit Iran I love our Mustafa passengers and cargo are transported by train there 38 millions of passengers a year as well as lots of machines vehicles and goods or years too much in 1925 when Reza Khan came to power as Reza Shah Persia was a structurally weak agricultural country the train was intended to help the country called Iran from 1935 onwards flourish economically the Shah ruled with an iron fist and the day the Islamic Republic of Iran has it's very own understanding of democracy there's no freedom of the press here the railway owes its existence to the country's natural resources it was built to transport oil passenger transport was unimportant at first but that's all my young follow my wishes I always take the train when I travel jovica thought they said in verse 11 sir the Train is a good mode of transport that you can wrestle well our army can definitely mine either have me at the Hoover it's a very journey I'm retired we shall get the media for a year Iowa before that I worked with the raw materials company for 30 years serving my country well model our bottom we're in one of the most significant regions for global energy Iran has the world's fourth largest oil and second largest natural gas reserves the state-owned companies don't publish exactly how much they extract every year the country is highly dependent on income from raw materials however as a result it's interested in loosening the economic sanctions that have been in place since 2006 rubbish as subtle I selected oil was discovered in Iran and exported more than a hundred years ago astronaut Amamiya Satoru hybrid Michiko hollow that isn't what I say the Kadena stuff Oh Daria which the train line that used to transport the oil to the ships on the Persian Gulf runs right next to us suppose as message about a shared captain as vanishes get enough as we might set a model have any job that might set him on Castro without the oil the railway line wouldn't have been built oil exports created the economic conditions for its construction that was unusual in Asia at the time railway lines were largely planned by the various colonial rulers and built for their needs in independent Iran however the Shah was in charge even raised special taxes I said and foolish as money money for the railway line came from a tax on sugar and she insisted that way we didn't have to get into debt with other countries she's hearted you know that negative the construction of the trans Iranian railway to the good 11 years 230 tunnels and 4,100 bridges were needed for the difficult terrain it was worth it the costs of transporting oil were reduced by 80 percent it used to take weeks to transport the oil now it could be done in a matter of days [Music] water has also always been important in Iran we're visiting the legendary hydraulic system in Schuster [Music] it's a unesco world heritage site the water from the Garga river was channeled to power water mills once enough water is dammed the where is opened just like with a regular mill and those stone is put into operation using hydropower the grain is ground it's a simple principle that still works today this workplace is also pleasantly cool even when it's 48 degrees outside we leave the plains behind and start climbing into the Zagros Mountains the trans Iranian railway runs through the day's River Valley for 70 kilometers it's one of the most scenic stretches of the entire route [Music] railway has made this remote region accessible a halt for prayer the trains have to make unscheduled stops Islam is the official religion in Iran the faithful have around twenty minutes to pray there are prayer rooms in every station with a strict separation of the sexes we continue our journey in this vehicle a trolley we've been invited to join a maintenance team on its daily inspection trip the railways an important employer here [Music] the roots here in Lauriston has a special appeal I've been working on this line for 18 years it's really good work I'm interested in what I do I love my work and do it as best I can times unofficially the unemployment rate in Iran is more than 20% so secure jobs with the National Railway are highly sought-after even though the works hard the track bed is always moving because of the heavy train in addition to continental tectonic plates meet in the Zagros Mountains and they also caused the ground to move what's the boss quickly checks that everything is as it should we're allowed to travel a little further with the light trolley after a short journey we're in BCA a very popular place people come from far and wide to visit this waterfall at 70 meters it's an exciting natural spectacle it gets busy here at the weekends people even come here from distant Tehran to chill out and smoke of hookah when we're visiting we only see men women aren't supposed to enjoy themselves in public in Iran but the Iranians have a relaxed attitude to water there's a saying we're where there's water there's culture water invigorates us water is life lighten the earth are dependent on water there would be nothing without water we reach what's quite literally a high point of our journey the highest point on the iranian railway network at 2217 meters this high point in the Zagros Mountains is here between Darood and Iraq during our oriental railway adventure we constantly tried to chat with the people we sensed they were fearful they didn't want to say something inappropriate on camera our retired train drivers not scared however Giardia pneumonia one day I traveled from half-day petal shoosh the station chief told me that a woman was very advanced in her pregnancy and was in labor one is the mango giveaway he told me she had to get two hundy mesh - taffy the traffic controller said he wouldn't do it I took her on the train when we arrived at the freight station she gave birth to a healthy baby it's correct body and limit then Isaiah monkey we're arriving in God a highly religious City which is popular with all iranian 'he's maybe for this reason [Music] its inhabitants are considered by many to be fanatical Shiites there are lots of religious schools in gone the Ayatollah Khomeini he lived here until he was exiled in 1964 after his return - he spent most of his time and gone but many pilgrims come to visit one of Iran's most important Shiite holy places the Fatima Matsumae shrine but adherence to Islam as the state religion is crumbling among the population people feel confined they feel the state and religion are interfering too much in their lives the totalitarian claim to power no longer fits with a modern society even though the people's faith is faltering it's still good for business here many pilgrims come to gum for Friday prayers in particular and these pilgrims are hungry for sohan guns said to have the best so hon it's made of wheat germ flour and sugar and sometimes cardamom saffron oil or butter even though few people talk about the char these days when he tried so hard during a visit to bomb he made it famous throughout the country uh very we asked dyad for his secret recipe but he would only tell us a little bit we got part of it you should start work in the name of God and then it always goes well we do it the way the scholars taught us we stick to that and our success vindicates us muhammediye the new railway station in gone is like a no-man's land way outside the city nobody lives here but it connects to the high-speed rail line to Tehran I just feel that we're proud to have a train that so fast high speeds aren't without their problems we don't like the stress during the day in particular it can happen that people step onto the tracks there's no fencing that's not good but apart from that it's great on the last 135 kilometers to Tehran the train races through the desert here it's cool inside thanks to the air conditioning unit and there's a movie playing it's the pride and joy of the Iranian railway we're on the Iranian railways fastest train the parties it was built by Zeman's Donner Party and has a top speed of a hundred and sixty kilometers per hour had access we'll have this not just in my past life - paddies paradise at 160 km/h there are no problems with the air conditioning in this train even with a blistering 50 degrees outside the tracks follow astora croute the Silk Road this caravanserai is evidence of that mechanic in the name of the God the most merciful wherever that came were Hamid are bad caravans arrived this is one of the most important historic sites in Iran and it's very well known if you stayin volunteer that a young a khadeem that was already when people still traveled with horses and camels they would spent the night in such a caravanserai what's offered on each other still hasn't yet become a very distant there were caravanserai is every 30 to 40 kilometers along the route roughly how far a caravan of camels could travel in a day the central courtyard is a characteristic feature this is where the horses and camels were looked after it was a welcoming place where travelers could relax and bathe and refuel for the next leg through the desert but now we're going to Tehran by Express train travelers don't need caravansaries anymore now they can be gently rocked to sleep we soon reached the outskirts of Tehran Iran's capital has a population of more than 8 million in the mid 1920s when razor shark into power the city had just 250,000 residents he fueled the modernization of the city thereby attracting more and more people he had the main station in Tehran built by a German company it's currently being refurbished we've covered around 900 kilometers since the start of our journey it's time for brakes we can get an idea of the size of Tehran from Mount Russia which overlooks the city the bazaar quarters are must for every visitor to the city [Music] we dive into one of the biggest bazaars in the world Aled 10 kilometers long 30 thousand shops and a hundred thousand jobs the bazaar is the shop owners are powerful in 1979 they were among the supporters of the Islamic Revolution fearing the shah's pro-western economic policies since then women have had to wear head scarves in public that too is good for business when a customer asks about the price the design or the color I know at once what taste she has if she asked for a light headscarf she wants to buy it for a young woman or a girl if a customer wants a black headscarf it's either for an older woman or she has no time and has to buy one quickly notice there are guardians of public morals everywhere making sure that all women obey the headscarf rule that applies to female tourists too we discover this station near the bazaar it was abandoned a long time ago it's part of the narrow gauge railway that started operating between Tehran and the Shia Abdul Azim shrine in Rea in 1888 making it purges first railway this locomotive dates back to the old pilgrims train the locals call it the Machine duty the smoke machine but instead of using the train the pilgrims initially preferred to cover the nine kilometers to the shrine on foot as I had always done a former passenger remembers yoga most okay Malika devil's best remember when I was 12 I went to shah abdul aziz with my family there was a big garden there at the time called back to tea madam the people from tehran went there and relaxed under the trees there was a lot of pushing around when we wanted to board the train when Jamie left and Barry pitch me Yagami anak they were elbowing each other as they climbed onto the trailer the arrow-holder than was very divided in Verona Mehmet and Bala this place of pilgrimage is located on what was once an important intersection on the Silk Road it has existed for more than a thousand years and is the fourth most important place of pilgrimage in Iran it's a holy place for Shiites [Music] as mikonam austin has that Apple as he has rathi Abdul Azim pilgrimage site is one of the most sacred places in Iran as what report on these sites in the historic city of Ramachari three descendants of the Prophet are buried here Vanuatu gonna pay cumber as well some great shiite scholars and only she mad fool herself unfortunately non-muslim cameras aren't allowed to take a closer look at the shrine well otherwise we'll miss a thing not even a smallest grain of dust on this larger-than-life Quran at Tehran station passengers can't get onto the platform without a valid ticket [Music] the platforms are open shortly before the train to pass [Music] this train to bandit or c'mon on the caspian sea also has allocated sea [Music] we're going to cover four hundred and sixty kilometers on our second leg [Music] the Greater Tehran is home to more than 15 million people once again the conductor forbids any interviews it's a shame [Music] we try our luck at the rug washing this tool is called chesh may Ally water quality here is said to be particularly good both for carpets and bathing [Music] the men handle the hand-knotted rugs with something like veneration rugs have been washed here for a long time today the only people who come here are those who can't do it at home such as Afghans who live in rented accommodation this place used to be full of rice these days most rugs are dry-cleaned the foothills of the outboards mountains not to be confused with the Mount Elbrus the highest mountains in the caucasus mountains pointers north our journey is currently taking us through the fertile valley in Zarine dashed a remote region that can almost only be reached by train many Iranians haven't seen this splendid landscape before either but there are many other reasons to prefer the Train to a car marques are aware from Tehran we want to get to sugar we take the train because the roads are safe there are lots of accidents the train safely the Train continues to climb almost imperceptibly Iran is a rich country even though most people don't benefit much from it they're suffering under the economic sanctions and high inflation taking the train isn't always about nostalgia Iran's north is also rich in natural resources high quality coal is mined here the coal mine employs 70 men who all earn around 300 euros a month about 50% above the legal poverty line it's not a lot of you consider the strategic significance this mine once had although I'm good how about this mine was set up because coal was needed for the steam trains during the Second World War muscle sister the trains transported weapons and soldiers and are so near oi salvo and went from south to north well I wanted to go far to survive alone for your services these days the coal is used for non-military purposes such as iron smelting or just heating people's homes but during the Second World War the coal was used by the Red Army in its fight against Nazi Germany 19:41 Russian and British troops invaded Iran they confiscated the trans Iranian railway which was quite new back then from then on it was used as a transport corridor the Persian corridor 646 boatloads of war equipments were moved by rail from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea that allowed the Red Army to launch a decisive offensive against Germany in 1944 [Music] the heavy military trains needed a lot of coal they had to negotiate differences in altitude of as much as 2,000 meters beautiful structures such as that good pass made it possible after a few minutes we reach the pride and joy of the Iranian railway their esque bridge because of its significance in the Second World War is also called the Victory bridge 120 metres tall it's the highest railway bridge in Iran Valda Eichner the Austrian engineer who built it is buried in this small Cemetery within sight of the bridge if the towing pod Hoddy the people celebrated the inauguration of the bridge and sacrificed their animal I think equals it as I shot of that it was Tommy bean and dad who they were proud that razor Shah had come to their village and hamburger Holly that poor poor boy many important people came with him including from the military they all wanted to see whether the bridge was stable it's said that the Shah forced the engineer to stand under the bridge with his wife and only daughter as the first train crossed for this complementarity the pole they would have been the first people to die if it had collapsed in port-a-crib Assad but it can't be questioned say man trains still cross this bridge today we continue our journey and reach the fertile Caspian coastline [Music] rice is a particularly common crop here the quiet sounds are evidence of the hard work on the fields of the dreams of the women doing that work [Music] preparations for baking bread we've been invited to dinner by the cushion family it's evening and everyone's looking forward to the meal we've been travelling during Ramadan meaning that Muslims aren't allowed to eat or drink between sunrise and sunset the only exceptions here are the old the sick children and pregnant women the hunger and anticipation are huge we're all excited about the fresh bread but still baked here in the traditional way all the remaining preparations are made in the kitchen in fairness that this mash is part of every meal for us it consists of flour rice flour rose water vanilla sugar and milk flashes these ingredients are mixed and put on the hob it stirred until it becomes thick this mash is a staple of Iranian cuisine we eat it to break the fast honey it on your houses at last it's sunset and people are allowed to eat and drink the family sit on the floor in the traditional manner we were allowed to sample the delicious bread as well we would have liked to enjoy the hospitality of the Christian family for longer but we had to move on [Music] norther sorry we depart from the historic track there was once a 128 kilometer track here built under German supervision the aim was to collect data that would help estimate the exact cost of building the railway by the way travelers and that includes train passengers don't have to fast during Ramadan I would be funny we're heading to be sure to visit our family for Ramadan following over there we like taking the train we always use it we like it safety and convenience and we're always together and that's why the Train is a good choice for us gelato this section of the journey seems to be a good one for sleeping that's no surprise because the Iranian railway has invested in modern carriages here [Music] it's good for the train staff to MusclePharm riding wealth loss of homologa more when the passengers are comfortable we're happy to have a little versa roadside initial there since we bought these air-conditioned trains from hi own died five years ago we and the passengers don't have problems anymore otherwise with you my own blood level we reached the terminus of the trans Iranian railway in Banda tour c'mon this small port is unspectacular it was once an important Russian supply hub the temperatures here are more pleasant than in southern Iran a short walk along the old track takes us to the Caspian Sea trains haven't passed this way for a long time the Caspian Seas the world's largest enclosed inland body of water Hossein takes us on his boat and shows us the island of me and Calais which is a protected Nature Reserve wild horses roam free here we use the peace Inquirer to talk to her saying about the significance of the term freedom Oh freedom means that you're left to your own devices and that you can say what you want - time is to be scored visibility rhythm of them I suppose it doesn't mean being naked going to a nightclub and drinking alcohol freedom also means security why we have freedom in our country but it's a bit limited but the country and its society are changing offering hopes that Iranians will

56,0,Testosterone — new discoveries about the male hormone | DW Documentary,"Testosterone has long been seen as a metaphor for aggression, but is there really anything to the idea of the testosterone-driven male? Prominent scientists explain how subtle the hormone’s effects actually are. Men with a lot of testosterone have long been accused of violent and competitive behavior. Now the image of the sex hormone is changing. Unlike in the animal world, the general statement """"testosterone makes one aggressive"""" cannot be confirmed in humans, and recent studies suggest that it can actually even promote selfless behavior. One of the leading experts in this field is Jean-Claude Dreher from Lyon. He says his laboratory experiments show that testosterone does not make men aggressive but instead allows them to act in a strategic manner. Those who are more testosterone-charged tend to be friendlier towards others in order to bolster their own social status. British behavioral psychologist Simon Baron Cohen demonstrates how testosterone determines our gender characteristics when we are still in the womb. Meanwhile, his colleague Oliver Schultheiss from Erlangen has found out how testosterone can improve our learning abilities.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Documentary,G0Iq45Nbevk,"[""testosterone is the most important male sex hormone men who are heavily influenced by testosterone are said to be egotistical and they enjoy taking risks but a number of European scientists have been trying to find out whether testosterone is really as bad as its reputation [Music] we've come to the munster University Hospital to talk to doctor Michels it's man a German specialist in the treatment of diseases that affect men he is also an expert on hormones Tesla stolen is swoosh tanisha feeder dinging testosterone is responsible for the development of a number of male physical characteristics including hair patterns on the head it also determines beard growth affects muscles and a man's overall personality it's a much more complex hormones than some people might think too often s indicting encanta most testosterone is produced in the testes but a small amount comes from the adrenal cortex [Music] the specific sources of testosterone are the lydic cells the hormones that are responsible for developing male characteristics in the body are called androgens the most important androgen is testosterone [Music] levels of testosterone rise dramatically during puberty and then remain at a high level but researchers have also found significant short-term increases in this hormone immediately after birth - Asians claw varoom does Perseid as shrine ABBA it's hard to say why that happens but it seems to be a part of the maturation process in the brain and in the male reproductive system the spirit of a monastic were hopes of mukesh young christian wolff lives in Heilbronn at the age of 20 he discovered that he had too little testosterone in his body doctors later determined that the cells in his brain were not sending out the proper production signals the cause of the problem wasn't clear at first wolf had a hard time even describing the symptoms it took a long time for doctors to come up with a proper diagnosis as vondopoulos concerts man realizing that something was wrong was a gradual process it didn't happen overnight feeling worse and worse I had no energy at all and no sex drive either but I could feel something just wasn't right then I was diagnosed with depression and I realized that something was seriously wrong with me wolf was a medical student at the time and a bodybuilder he kept a close eye on his metabolism and testosterone levels but they couldn't figure out what was going on I got along well with my family and had a girlfriend I was doing well at school and then I figured out that this might have something to do with the testosterone deficiency so I had some tests done and the levels turned out to be about zero that's a bit low isn't essential vanish [Music] how much testosterone do men actually need in tuition it's on average men have at least eight to twelve nanomoles per liter of testosterone toises anything below that represents a deficiency but the amount also depends on genetics I'm a single machine Finnegan a tech woman's testosterone levels are much lower about five to ten percent that of men they use the testosterone to synthesize estrogen system the primary female sex hormone through the fut is that synthesis is carried out by an enzyme called aromatisse it can be found in cells in several parts of the body including the brain adrenal glands ovaries and testes in the face of such testosterone levels Christian Wulff chose a potentially risky form of medical treatment we'll sit out okay messiahfest I knew I needed hormone replacement therapy after other possible causes like vitamin D or zinc deficiency had been ruled out wasn't one of the side effects of hormone replacement therapy is that it suppresses sperm production which can cause infertility testosterone and covered testosterone is naturally produced in the testicles but the process begins in the brain specifically in the hypothalamus sign and sleep Danna sent our destroyer ironhide's it links the body's nervous system to the endocrine system through the pituitary gland unrelated to perfuse the pituitary gland is divided into two sections the anterior portion produces two key hormones LH and FSH LH is responsible for stimulating the production of testosterone in the testes FSH contributes to the production of sperm these two hormones report back to the brain on whether the body is producing enough testosterone and sperm the brain adjust the amounts of each as necessary [Music] in the test system even testosterone replacement therapy suppresses the hormones in the pituitary gland that are responsible for sperm production it's like a birth control pill v and the pure feeling man eyes don't look too feminine Budong but if a man is testosterone deficient and wants to have children we have to take a different approach low testosterone can have serious effects on the body but can too much of this hormone make men overly aggressive this is Leone home of Frances Center for cognitive neurosciences jean-claude Rhea is a research director here Draya has been studying the influence of testosterone on human behavior and he's found little evidence that testosterone strokes aggression in men to the effect that testosterone has on human behavior is by no means clear but there is some indirect evidence example high levels of testosterone have been found in some prison inmates who have committed serious crimes and we did a study which indicated that patients who are given testosterone injections could become more aggressive it's only 50 million new condition testosterone can also actually improve social behaviors noxee pal some problems related CBT so at this point there's little hard evidence pointing to a link between increased levels of testosterone and aggressive behavior drea conducted an experiment to try to prove or disprove these claims his first task was to measure the testosterone levels in the participants blood testosterone is a fat-soluble hormone so it can pass through the membranes of cells bind with hormone receptors and then produce changes in the cell's structure testosterone can be identified and measured in various bodily fluids including saliva urine and blood before the experiment begins one group of participants is injected with testosterone the other group is given a placebo we tried to determine whether the increase in testosterone levels would contribute to a change in behavior this graph shows that both groups started out with approximately the same level of testosterone injections then we gave one group testosterone injections and recorded the increase in the level of this hormonal system now the test subjects are going to take part in a game exercise called ultimatum the game is frequently used in behavior research it's designed to test whether a person is generous or selfish one of the players is given a sum of money and is required to share part of it with the other if the second player accepts the offer the deal goes ahead as planned but if he rejects it neither player gets any money at this point we observed no difference between the player who had been given testosterone and the one who has until into systole and I said that now the rules of the game are going to change a bit the players will be able to use the money to reward fair behavior or punish unfair behavior and this is where Draya and his colleagues observed a difference between the player who got an extra dose of testosterone and the one who didn't [Music] silver bishop team miss Cruz it's a subtle difference and we confirmed it only in the second stage of the experiment the group administered with extra testosterone imposed a more severe punishment when they believed that they hadn't been given enough money but at the same time they also reacted more positively when given more money than expected we observed a big difference in the behavior of the two groups even loop-de-loop so can testosterone also stimulate generosity in men the researchers were surprised by the results but the situation is more complex than that Draya says there's a subconscious motivation at work here [Music] this phenomenon shows clearly that you can improve your social status if you cooperate with people or engage in other kinds of positive social behaviors utility so while testosterone can influence aggression it also plays a role in the ability to act with generosity so the noise State drea has been looking for more evidence to support his theory on the influence of testosterone so he's been studying brain activity 30 system testosterone based behavior can improve the man social status and that process could be linked to various mechanisms in the brain particularly a group of neural structures known as the reward system baltimore improved social status generates a sense of well-being like a reward that may explain the boasting trade commonly associated with excessive manly behavior to god there's always a motivation behind generosity if someone sees you being generous they're more likely to think highly of you for example men will probably be more generous if they know that they are being observed by women cubes this indicates another link between testosterone and generous behavior so testosterone may be responsible for positive and negative behavior in both cases this behavior seems to be directed at preserving or even improving social status [Music] psychologist Pranjal Mehta is an associate professor at University College in London his research focuses on how hormones particularly testosterone influence human behavior the evidence for that myth that testosterone is directly related to masculine traits like aggression has not worn out in the data so there are plenty of results suggesting that testosterone is either weekly or unrelated to aggressive behavior at all in in humans including human males so the field is still trying to unpack these kinds of effects to understand when testosterone might be related to other behaviors like helping and pro-social behavior as well meta has carried out an experiment that involves the ultimatum game similar to the one we saw earlier it's actually a way to look at two kinds of behaviors one is trust to what extent is the first-mover trusting and two to look at reciprocity of trust if someone is hyper trusting is the second move are going to reciprocate that trust as in the experiment carried out by jean-claude rhea one player was given an extra dose of testosterone the other player was given a placebo the experiment will measure the level of trust between the two the player administered testosterone can use his money to make sure that the other player also profits but will the second player give back some of his winnings as a gesture of gratitude or will he keep it all for himself we found two interesting effects first is consistent with the stereotype testosterone reduced trust in the first mover so that is somewhat consistent with the stereotype testosterone being related to competitiveness and threatened the environment and maybe mobilizing more selfish social behaviors right so I want to keep the money next the players reverse their roles in both tests the player with the extra testosterone shares his winnings with the other this is an example of pro-social behavior we know that reciprocity in cooperative situations that is going to Gardner status and what we found is that testosterone boosted reciprocity and we're arguing that in a cooperative environment it's again as through prestige and pro-social behaviors that you gain status and so though in those situations testosterone actually might boost pro-social behavior Mehta is convinced that testosterone plays a much more complex role in human behavior than researchers previously thought for example it can promote socially positive behavior but there's always a motivating factor behind that behavior you can imagine when we think about our leaders and people in positions of power they have expertise knowledge and experience that they're gonna relay to their subordinates that's part of being a good leader that's also part of some definitions of power where you're helping others as a way to influence others in some way so you can think of it as pro-social but it's also in some definitions an exertion of power but concepts such as masculinity status and power are perceived differently in various cultures around the world we'll the test results differ from one country to the next so my laboratories in London someone else's laboratory is in Germany someone else's laboratory is in a rural part of the south of the United State that should see erratically be expected to change the results but the effects of testosterone on the human body are the same regardless of culture and geography when Christian Wulff found out that he was infertile he started looking for solutions my mother took me to see a urologist and he told her that I will never have children but I could have a superlative sex life my mom didn't think it was funny so I started reading up on my conditioners in dusty my lines of folks are is there a medical solution to infertility caused by testosterone deficiency doctors it's Minh offers some hope [Music] when a man kena wound shut wound license one of the things we can do for men who suffer from this problem is to give them injections of ganado tropen hormones giggity happy Mike his form of treatment has been used for years even decades it seemed and becomes the gonadotropins include LH which is responsible for the production of testosterone in the testes and FSH which contributes to the production of sperm the treatment was successful for Christian Wulff his body was able to produce testosterone and fertile sperm for a short period of time he had the sperm frozen for later use he starts to nuts and if I had listened to what the doctors told me at first it would have ended right there but now I can have children all over Schulte eyes is a professor of psychology at Friedrich Alexander University in Erlangen his research work focuses on how testosterone affects the body specifically bone growth effective on testosterone testosterone and estradiol its counterpart in females contribute significantly to bone strength and density from prenatal development to maturity on this we income and somebody I'm in that is asked for example during the first three months of pregnancy testosterone causes the ring fingers of the male fetus to grow longer than the index fingers short ice notes that in general women's index fingers are longer than their ring fingers in men it's just the opposite you can see that in this image of a man's hand the index finger is clearly shorter than the ring finger testosterone clearly has an influence on bone growth even in the early stages of pregnancy it may also be responsible for the early development of the so-called power motive yes isn't shaft Liam Priscilla - Sean Service is that a scientist I'm interested in finding out where that motive comes from I suspect that its origins can be found in biology here salt ice is conducting an experiment in which the participants write a fantasy narrative this may help him to determine whether they are motivated by power the power motive is a common human characteristic that involves one person's efforts to have an impact on the behavior of others this motivation does not necessarily manifest itself in conscious attitudes or the beliefs that we have about ourselves our research indicates that the way we perceive ourselves actually has little to do with what makes us tick and what influences our spontaneous behaviors from influence this part of the experiment involves a series of 10 tests aimed at finding out how the participants respond to victory or defeat the test results can be manipulated one participant can win up to eight of the ten rounds the researchers want to find out whether any changes take place in the test subjects hormone levels [Music] we found that the power motive plays a role in their response to winning or losing those who won had higher levels of testosterone than those who lost even Phyllida and if one of the participants is not motivated by power but wins it has no effect on the amount of testosterone in his system we can't say that winning or losing is exclusively responsible for changes in testosterone levels we have to take into account factors such as the individual's personality and motivation but those factors are shaped by testosterone during fetal brain development clicked human thick lung but does it all come down to testosterone and its influence in determining for example male finger length and the development of the power motive women have only 10% of the testosterone levels found in men does that mean that they are less motivated by power we are invited of the space colony and vibe there's evidence that indicates that there is a connection between the length of woman's fingers and the power motive complex it's a complex situation that will require a lot more research scientists have learned more in recent years about female sex hormones but the relationship between women and power has not been widely studied the field has focused on male reproductive system and males for the past hundred years and has largely neglected looking at female sex hormones in the context of status and leadership and this is this is a large gap in the literature today we've come to the University of Cambridge to talk to clinical psychologist Simon baron-cohen part of his research focuses on how gender affects human behavior in general and the brain in particular we've been looking at sex differences in the mind between males and females on average and one of their tests that we use is where you have to find a shape that's hidden in a design as quickly as you can and we find that on average men are faster at finding this target hidden in the overall design Baron Cohen and his colleagues conducted behavioural studies of children and adolescents they started by testing hormone levels in numerous samples of amniotic fluid the liquid that helps protect the fetus in the womb we've measured the testosterone during pregnancy in the womb in the amniotic fluid so this is the baby in the womb and some women during pregnancy have a clinical procedure it's called amniocentesis where a needle goes into that fluid to take out some of the fluid and we can measure testosterone in the fluid and babies vary in terms of how much of the hormone they are exposed to so boys show more more testosterone than girls in the amniotic fluid in the early stages of fetal development the genitalia show no signs of gender distinction but after approximately the seventh week of gestation a gene on the Y chromosome can activate a process that results in the development of testicles later testosterone plays a role in the development of masculine characteristics in several parts of the male fetus including the brain we're looking at these long-term effects of the hormones presumably mediated by changes in brain development so we're measuring the behavior but the assumption is that the hormones have changed brain development in males and females because they're exposed to different amounts of the hormone after the babies and baron-cohen study were born he measured and analyzed their reaction to a series of images what we found was that the higher the child's prenatal testosterone the less eye contact the child makes at their first birthday so this was them a surprise for us because you would think iContact is influenced by social factors but actually it seems to also be influenced by prenatal testosterone the children were tested again at the age of two the results indicated that girls more actively sought eye contact than boys did and had better verbal skills they talked earlier and their language develops faster what we didn't know is why why do girls have this advantage in language development but now we could relate it back to the prenatal testosterone because we found that children who had a higher prenatal testosterone had smaller vocabularies years later baron-cohen conducted more tests on the children they were shown images of various facial expressions and were asked to describe the emotion the images portrayed and again we found that the higher the child's prenatal testosterone the more difficulty they have on this test of empathy which is a surprise again for us because we're finding there's even there it's eight years later since we measured the testosterone there's still an effect that we're observing to sum up girls did better on tests that involved verbal and social skills boys were better at developing analytical skills the same hormone seems to be involved not only in social development like reading faces and language and eye contact but also in non social skills like pattern recognition and and taking things apart to see parts within the homes a bit like on the rubic cube where you have to see the pattern very quickly the tests indicate that boys better able to understand abstract concepts but have less empathy Baron Cohen has used the findings to support his theory of a possible link between testosterone and autism we looked at the relationship between typical sex differences in autism because what is amiss more common in boys so we were trying to understand why why why why does being a boy lead you to a higher likelihood that you'll develop autism and the answer we're getting is that one factor may be prenatal testosterone research on this subject is still in the early stages and experts are still trying to find out what role prenatal testosterone plays in determining sexual differentiation in the brain the skewness the McNish there's no evidence of predetermination in the brain we're sort of pushed one way or the other by hormonal effects in the early stages of fetal brain development of course but very much development happens later after birth in infancy and beyond when hormones act jointly with a number of external factors in the environments and above all in a child social environments and here Pranjal Mehta has been researching the influence that hormones and social environment have on behavior development [Music] researchers have including my lab have looked at both directions of effects how hormones influence dominance and status related behaviors and how one's social status and the environment in turn can impact hormone fluctuations in a feedback loop meter also studied how people perceive themselves and how that perception influences their behavior do people consider themselves dominant or passive and what role does testosterone play and so what we found was that testosterone didn't have a direct effect and competitive decision-making but it really depended on whether they filled out the questionnaire suggesting that they were high or low in dominance so some of our work does suggests that hormones do impact behaviors such as competitive behavior but interestingly and inconsistent with the sort of myth about testosterones direct effects this depends on people's personality so the way we see ourselves so testosterone influences our personality and in turn our personality influences our level of testosterone high levels of testosterone are said to make men virile and dominant and society either views such men with respect or contempt testosterone also fuels competition among men perhaps it's no coincidence that this hormone was discovered during the late stages of the Industrial Revolution [Music] in the 1850s sharla Edouard Braun circa was one of the first scientists to speculate on the existence of substances that we now know as hormones he also regularly injected himself with a fluid extracted from animal testicles and claimed that this process improved his sexual prowess and physical well-being [Music] testosterone has long been associated with masculinity strength and vitality [Music] today testosterone replacement therapy has become popular among older men in some advertisements it's touted as a miracle cure much as Braun Sekhar claimed more than a century ago pharmacies doctors and drug companies make a lot of money selling testosterone preparations sales have increased sharply since 2007 dr. Michelle its Minh is regularly consulted by older men suffering symptoms of exhaustion many warrior testosterone deficiency may be the cause one Centurion zitz Minh tests the patient's sperm count and bone density among other procedures in most cases he's not able to attribute the symptoms to reduce levels of testosterone using bad seeing this graphic shows the testosterone levels of 10,000 men ranging in age from 4 to 90 the boys of course have very low levels signs intimacy and needs a good test is to only come here and improve it the levels increase during puberty then we see high levels of testosterone right into old age if we rule out disease there are several reasons why testosterone levels may fall in other myosins fairness is to say in the vast majority of cases these patients produce less testosterone simply because they're overweight Gupta's obesity is a problem for many older men and younger men too for that matter overweight men usually have a lot of visceral fat and that fat releases a number of harmful substances and it can lead to insulin resistance high blood pressure and lower testosterone levels to be good thing one layer of body fat lies just beneath the skin a second layer visceral fat is stored in the abdominal cavity near several vital organs excess visceral fat can cut testosterone production which can promote the storage of even more fat in the abdominal cavity this causes the spare tire that's common among middle-aged men testosterone is often associated with doping scandals and competitive sports Michale Kleber with the German Olympic sports Confederation is an expert on the use of performance-enhancing substances including testosterone testosterone plays a key role in regulating muscle mass and how the body responds to exercise during prolonged physical activity the muscles suffer minor trauma so afterwards the body starts repairing the damaged muscular tissue and increasing its strength and size until recently only professional athletes use performance-enhancing drugs now amateur athletes are taking them as well use of testosterone derivatives called anabolic steroids at commercial fitness studios is a huge problem right now we believe that 13 to 16 percent of all clients have used doping preparations mostly anabolic steroids it's a lot more widespread among amateur athletes than it is among the professionals healthy males produce four to eight milligrams of testosterone every day but for those who are trying to increase muscle mass and performance that amount is too little Christian Wulff tried using testosterone supplements to counter his hormone deficiency skip Sophia product in danger supplement new sweetie now you can find testosterone boosters and capsules I knew that they weren't going to work but I tried them anyway companies that make these products play on your emotions that's why I bought them and of course they didn't help at all Niska but but only anabolic steroids synthetic versions of testosterone can produce the kinds of results that the athletes want the use of steroids to enhance moments is widespread among bodybuilders of my night unfortunate Sabha and Habash not complete in my own research I came across the case of a 17 year old who was using these substances he was scary he was injecting more than a thousand milligrams of testosterone derivatives a week he was also taking Dianabol steroid tablets every day so in all that's a lot more than a thousand milligrams a week that's a dangerous amount for a 17 year old it's a neon escaping the abuse of anabolic steroids can have a number of dangerous side effects including high blood pressure strokes heart attacks and liver damage excessive increases in testosterone can lead to reductions in sperm production because the brain determines that the body has enough testosterone and cuts off the supply [Music] Pranjal Mehta has been studying whether substances besides testosterone can influence human behavior for example cortisol a hormone that's often released in response to stress and low concentrations of blood sugar there are some evidence that cortisol levels could impact the pathway between testosterone and behavioral outcomes specifically hormones don't influence behavior directly but there's a mechanism through which they occur specifically one mechanism is they bind to a receptor for that specific hormone in the case of testosterone that would be the androgen receptor this binding process takes place throughout the body like a key fitting into a lock Mirta believes that in stressful situations cortisol blocks the testosterone receptors [Music] if cortisol levels are high that could actually antagonize or or impede the relationship between testosterone and behavior presumably through molecular pathways such as receptor reduction and so we theorized what we called the dual hormone hypothesis this role-playing exercise is designed to test the effect of cortisol on testosterone one participant gives a series of orders to the other if the player who's supposed to follow the orders feel stressed his behavior changes we found that when levels of cortisol were low that effect occurred that higher testosterone was related to more dominance but when cortisol levels are high that effect wasn't there higher testosterone was not related to more dominance so this is suggesting that testosterones effects on dominant behavior in a position of leadership really depends on what's happening in the stress axis in the body so is it possible that testosterone is just one of many substances that can influence human behavior more research on this subject needs to be done at this point experts have come to a variety of different conclusions biology does not mean simplicity I think it's recognizing and appreciating the complexity that's we are human beings we're dynamic systems we've developed and evolved to adapt to different environments and that hormones actually their beauty again is that they are responsive to the environment so your hormones affect the way you behave but then the environment also affects your hormone release in general testosterone represents two of the major societal themes of our time competition and success the cliche is that men who have too little testosterone are losers men who have a lot of it are winners [Music] invited me which table starts ends I don't know whether I should be proud of how much testosterone I have or not it depends on what society thinks or desirable qualities in men and that concept can change depending on the culture and the era 13% testosterone is the stuff that men are made of the actual quantity is not so important but every man needs at least a minimum amount since I started testosterone replacement therapy I felt a lot better the depression and lack of energy disappeared in two weeks and things just kept getting better for me I'm not confused and unhappy anymore so there's no simple one-to-one link between testosterone and male aggression or quest for power latest findings indicate it's social and cultural environment factors that determine testosterones effects on manly behavior

57,0,Inequality – how wealth becomes power (1/3) | DW Documentary (poverty richness documentary),"Germany is one of the world’s richest countries, but inequality is on the rise. The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. For the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gröner, one of Germany’s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. """"If you have great wealth, you can’t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,” Gröner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  """"Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we’re more independent,” Gröner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanović, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. """"These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,"""" Milanović notes. """"Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?”_______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

who have a lot of say in this country but a rarely heard in public corner is worth millions and private assets and company shares all of it and self-made [Music] let's say you have 250 million you could throw it out the window and it'll come back in through the door you can't destroy it you can buy cars and they go up in value you buy houses and real estate is worth more you buy gold and the gold prices go up you can't destroy money by consuming we've been following coasts of Kona for six months through him and many others this film takes a look at inequality in Germany a first glance Germany is a rich and powerful country full of opportunities but if you look closely you'll see wealth is more unevenly distributed here than in just about any other industrialized country success often depends on your background [Music] why is that do the differences threaten social cohesion and democracy to find some answers we go around the world and speak to a Nobel Prize winner and other experts who have looked deeply into the issue of inequality the world is at a crossroads today people sense that the control of their nation is being stolen from inequality is the most pressing social problem facing us today welcome to the land of inequality [Music] it's almost 8:00 in the morning in Berlin good longer my house the driver is already waiting when the boss comes he has to get moving right away Christophe Colonna a teacher son has made his way to the top often working 20 hours a day he's what's called a high achiever I don't have a driver because I'm lazier I think I'm too good for that on the contrary I like driving I'm a passionate motorist but the question is what does my company pay me for for sitting behind the steering wheel or for working corner earns his money with real estate hardly any company in Germany builds as much as his cg group does and in the housing market the prices only go in one direction upwards his company has just bought a very special building the developer wants to turn their Stieglitz a Keisel office block into the tallest residential tower in the city custom governor is always up for a challenge he wants to run all the way to the top in less than five minutes a race against himself 30 floors 120 meters 600 steps an employee times him with a stopwatch it's half a minute faster than the last time angry well it was pretty perfect but I could still do it better I could still remember back when I was finishing high school I watched Boris Becker when in Wimbledon and I thought just you wait I'll be right up there with you you know today's an apartment here will cost between five and ten thousand euros a square metre from up here corner can look down on many of his construction projects you can actually follow the trail of the last 20 years here in Berlin nearly 4,000 apartments and another 3,000 are under construction we've played a big role in housing construction here one stop this is Coronas headquarters in Berlin every company like this is a realm with the boss at the top and the staff beneath him corners company now employs 500 people they all have good contracts he says the 2015 tax statement from your brother there's a lot to pay one of his most important employees is his personal assistant Angelique Lisa you still in Dusseldorf then he'll be going on to Zurich then tomorrow he'll be back in Berlin Friday and Leipzig and then he'll be away over the long weekend and what about sleep not a lot there are rumors of between four and six hours I also don't think it'll be much more depending on how busy he is or whether he's traveling you can tell from when his emails arrive I'm an assistant like her has at least the same level of stress I have the boss is only as good as his assistant you don't notice it with her she's only been in the job for a few months so she's still fresh but she also has the Constitution for it Mario Lauterbach guards the door downstairs he's had a permanent contract as a security guard for half a year benzine outside gets in yeah but I went to school for 14 years I speak two or three foreign languages so if I ever got the opportunity again and had the initiative I could imagine becoming a lawyer or a judge that's something that interests me a lot latter Bach earns about 2,000 euros a month gross that's enough for a modest life but not much more his boss on the other hand has been able to build up millions of euros and assets can the guard live on what he earns from me that's what counts if he can then I've done my job as an employer if I pay a guard so little that he can't live off a salary then I've done something wrong so you think comparing him with you is nonsense of course it's nonsense I've stayed home from work due to sickness three times in 30 years ask my guard how many times he's been out sick if I have a slipped disc I come to work if I have a 40 degree fever I come to work if my wife quarrels with me and keeps me up all night I still come to work ask my security guard comparing us isn't fair or correct justification is miscarriage dismissed fish dish will he ever be able to afford a house with a pool of course not but he does not want that I know my security guards I know my caretakers would you like to trade places with her groaner didn't say yes right away I guess if I had to answer spontaneously my first answer would be no and I believe if I thought about it for a long time it would still be no that's actually got a lot less to do with him as a person or what he does it's just a question of my own attitude I wouldn't want to have that much responsibility would you like to have a house with the pool yes but then maybe not here in Germany where in Greece so whereas the one can only dream of a house with a pool the other can afford several properties Kristoff corner has a villa in Berlin and a penthouse in Cologne with a view of the cathedral but little time off how much distance should there be between those in the middle and those at the top and how big is the gap in reality there's a lot of data about poverty in the poor but very little about the rich estate asset registry would help but there isn't one and so a team from the German Institute for Economic Research is trying to find out more if you try to represent the wealth distribution in Germany in a graphic way you can do it quite simply on an a4 sheet of paper and a few look you can imagine a coordinate system like at school with an x-axis and a y-axis and with the y-axis this here I show the amount of wealth you can easily display ninety-five percent of the population on this sheet here in the - area because a part of the population is in debt or even insolvent and then there's a relatively broad area where assets are virtually zero until it finally starts to increase exponentially at the outer edge instructors this describes 95 percent of the population but the question is of course how far away is the richest person from this manager magazine puts the Reimann family business at the top of its rich list for Germany the family's estimated worth thirty three billion euros so if 95 percent of Germans are graphed on an a4 sheet that aemon's would be a whopping six point six kilometers further away every era has its mother lode in the past car makers made big money earlier still the families who owned the big trading houses became hugely wealthy now real estate developers have joined them gustaf corners rice began here in leipzig 20 years ago he invested when prices below it was all ruins or scrap [Music] I love everything you see to the left and right has been redeveloped built and rented out by us his company says it now builds one in three new apartments in the city but coast of Cavanaugh's Korea has been unusual he was not born a boss he used to work on construction sites himself every other stone has been replaced here with expertise with a sense of proportion to create an entirety and it helps if you have worked on scaffolding like this yourself I can do masonry I can lay concrete I can lay steel I can plaster walls lay tiles put up the sods that was my career the company started out as christophe grew nabokov Steen's to building services then we took on specialized construction then contractor work and project development until we became the company that we are today Kona has also invested in this former industrial district this is the class family Thomas and Kirkland with their two children they live in a rented apartment around the corner they wouldn't mind having one more room well you have to say it's an oasis in a built-up environment each building has nine classic apartments and two penthouses one large and one small at the top I'd like to show you all the floor plans in the trailer so we're about where the woman is right no the house is next to that the houses themselves or at least 20 meters further back to the penthouse apartments there we have a four room 123 square metre apartment with a 60 square meter roof terrace I think we need to be realistic the penthouse isn't what we need or what we can afford I take a classic four-room apartment with a balcony or shared garden I think that's what we'd be looking for that would interest us then let's take a look at a floor plan parents would practically have a separate wing here a sandpit playground and recreation area so in general the target group is young families yes typical young families give me some idea of the scale I'd be interested in a four-room apartment first floor would come at three thousand four hundred fifty euros the foreign apartment would cost four hundred and fifty thousand euros to buy the classes are a typical middle-class family they both have good jobs buying property used to be the way to start building up assets was a Matthias tarbush at the spoke we were 30 before we could even start to think about our old age and accumulating wealth to date now I'm almost 40 and we still haven't managed to put away much in terms of reserves I even come up with the minimum amount of capital so that banks will be able to give us a loan a sticking point the screens not food the other fueled 94 percent of buyers here aren't from Saxony that means this is currently a market where normal Saxons can't participate even each Michi encode the class family isn't the only one with little chance of owning their own place in all the richest 5% of Germans own half the apartments and houses every second person owns no property at all most Germans rent and are having to pay more and more for living space the purchase price of an 80 square metre apartment has soared in the last 10 years leipzig is an extreme case only 10% of the people here own real estate 60% of all new buildings and 94% of refurbished all buildings have gone to bias from out of town [Music] don't you want to get your shoes dirty mister I can feel pretty fastidious while the Klaus family hesitates others are snapping up the houses on the market did he make a killing again he did did he get another bargain we keep getting repeat offenders here they buy one house after another this is the third right it's his second his second complete one and the apartments before we went for a meal and I said it won't cost less than 4.5 and he got it for 3 well I'm crazy right today the time is ripe for us to make money here with the standard and my company urgently needs it that's not a crime no I don't think it is such a bad thing the real estate market is symptomatic it enables those on top to make more profits while others can hardly afford to live in their own city anymore behind this is the more basic question does profit for the one mean loss for the others today's typical property buyers are rich people well-off retirees yes and investors the others like Thomas Klaus and his colleagues can only look on [Music] honestly when I look at what's being built in the sluicey district I need a practical apartment to live in and I don't think they're building them to be lived in they're building them as investments and I can't join in that game none of my colleagues can't either that probably also creates housing that doesn't meet the needs of the city and most of the population scary because many people are being left behind banks digna there are many parts of life see who are nowadays you find one place with high priced apartments and another where the people who just couldn't afford to live in them anymore had to move to it's a crappy situation when you say that for whatever reason you have to get out of your apartment but you'd like to stay in your neighborhood but that's not possible [Music] in a neighborhood in the eastern part of Berlin bigger schlosser has been the scene of an escalating conflict between residents who are afraid of losing out economically and the man they accused of making the deal of his life here Gustov kkona arrives and his security guard stays close by when he's here he usually gets police protection I'm going to be disturbing your lunch break today so let me at least say good morning Korea has been the focus of an angry backlash his opponents filmed the first encounter with residents and protesters let me ask you is this a dialogue it was nice whether they were meeting me for the first time we could call it the birth of the boogeyman they got to see an entrepreneur who has arguments on his side and won't back down and it's precisely this stupid thinking that prevails in society there's always a direct connection he makes money and he's become wealthy so we must have stolen it from someone it's all about politics he's charging 12 euros a square metre nobody can afford that well we have smaller apartments 35 40 50 square meters which any nurse can afford even at 14 euros a square metre as long as it's well made has great light she'd love to live there instead of in 60 square meters over there for 8 euros a square metre Clara knows that many of his workmen or the police officers who protect him had difficulties finding affordable housing but he says his millions of square meters are not the cause of the problem but part of the solution [Music] how do you strike the right balance between rewarding achievement and letting everyone share in it what consequences does inequality have for society the real general finding is that inequality being a way of making people feel more distance from one another stretches the social fabric it phrased the social fabric it pulls us apart from one another physically experientially and psychologically there's nothing necessarily wrong with inequality of course people have an unequal endowments of intelligence and beauty and they have different parents and where I start to worry as a sociologist is when people accumulate dynastic wealth and dynastic wealth means a lot of money that gets transferred down through generations because that starts to stabilize systems of inequality across society and that constricts the opportunities available to everybody else coast of Ghana may have worked his way to the top but even for him there's still a glass ceiling you can't buy your way into the world of dynastic wealth you can only be born into it Kirsti on fly - best all-time traces his family tree back to the year 1135 he's a descendant of the fogers one of the richest families of the Middle Ages you can always use a winch to pull in the deer and you've killed a stag which normally weighs well over 100 kilos then you need mechanical help to get it into the vehicle would look a bit odd when you drive around towing a dead deer in a trailer people sometimes find that a little strange the car he's is to transport dead stags as an old Austrian military vehicle when bechtolsheim uses it in the 300 hectares of forest he owns somewhere in central Germany we're not allowed to say exactly where back was his condition for letting us film him discretion is everything why had some visits in the morning a forest is a wonderful feeling because you have the run of it so to speak Keltie I think it was the publisher of deed site countess den Hoff who once said you always have to own everything you love I can comprehend the question philosophically but if I answer according to my natural instincts I'd say yes I like owning things that I find beautiful man rush to gardenia demonize Shirin imprinted by citizens not Eagles it had the great inequality that exists room on your folks is wanted for the economy and it's unavoidable obviously if you're an entrepreneur and you have inherited something and keep it running properly you will have more than someone who's just an employee do you think that things are by and large fair in Germany yes by and large I do I don't sense any real feeling of injustice and the part of most people on the street lights Lord after stars it can be not having during the week from best Hawthorne works with a view of the main river in Frankfurt he heads what he calls the family office this exclusive establishment is essentially what used to be known as a private bank perhaps you should add that this is one of the few old Frankfurt patrician houses that survived the Second World War intact this old terrazzo floor or this handle this banister you don't often find them in Frankfort today these display cases you can see the remnants of what once made patrician dining culture so special Oscar Moffitt you have to imagine a family office as just that an office that takes care of the interests and all the financial needs of a single family or an individual that ranges from let's say five or ten million to several hundred million not even the employees know all the names of the bank's clientele the wealthy come via personal recommendations they know that from battle time will offer them something that normal savers can't get from a bank these days interest and returns on their money we've done work together to create an asset structure one for the future let's say you want to invest so and so much in real estate and with real estate you also have apartments and commercial buildings and maybe even logistics stick stocks it's maybe thirty percent you might put 10% into pensions and 10% in cash the rest is invested in other things private equity forestry and so on we help families to maintain their fortunes for generations that is what we aspire to the legend surrounding germany's post-war economic recovery sometimes and evokes the notion of a kind of monetary zero-hour when everyone supposedly had to start from scratch if you wanted to get rich you had to work your way up according to the myth what's photomask Noveck shortly before the first world war a former interior ministry official published an almanac of millionaires in buda Shanda in these books you still find numerous names that look very familiar today if you look at the lists of the wealthy you get the impression that old money plays a huge role among the big fortunes today I'm hiding guns awesome for moving our biases line the ups transition dean dean the gap between those who only have work do you and those who belong to the upper class has increased enormously if i took for clue such i think if people understood how how deeply unfair economic competition was in the modern global economy they really would be up in arms [Music] it's the end of Thomas class's shift after visiting the construction site he and his wife considered the real estate agents offer at the moment the family lives essentially from his income his wife has reduced her workers to take care of the children [Music] the children are eager to tell their father about the events of the day they visited their grandmother once the children go to bed the parents talk about buying the apartment in the middle of the city when this dish walked on join us mommy first you are all enthusiastic and a bit dazzled by the idea and the beautiful project and by the question about whom the project is aimed at well at young families like you on the one hand that's flattering but on the other hand when you then hear the price and think about it again these are dimensions where I say that a family like us are out of it we aren't expecting an inheritance or any other sources of outside money we have to earn it on a monthly basis four hundred fifty thousand euros I don't even know how many annual incomes that would be as I income in the severan so at some point you start to worry that the step downwards into the lower middle class is much closer than the step up into the upper middle class I think everyone has the same feeling I'm lucky I have a big employer I feel like I have won the jackpot in Leipzig but that doesn't mean that we can keep up with the developments in the real estate market being mauled the classes are not poor but they belong to a group that has come under pressure in recent years the middle class the people who have no fortunes but have to work for prosperity in recent months thousands have sent in comments online for this film project under the hashtag on Graceland for example they've reported their salaries an industrial clerk in the car industry 1600 euros net a social worker in a rehab clinic 1648 net a civil engineer nearly 2000 net a medical specialist work 12 years of training 2768 net a net income of 3500 euros puts a single person in Germany's top 10% of earners accumulated wealth is particularly unequal half the population has less than 17 thousand euros in reserve that would let them buy a base-model VW Golf all shoes and clothing for 1.6 children from birth to the age of 18 or just 3.3 square meters of a newly built apartment in Frankfurt the vast majority of the gains and income have gone to people at the very top of the income distribution in the top 1% of the income distribution and incomes for people in the middle class and below the middle class have essentially not increased or have even fallen at the bottom very large middle class is necessary for peaceful and democratic societies and if you now have polarization in rich countries and if you have shrinkage of the middle classes then you really have a problem or you are really moving to a new territory that is just unexplored yet in u.s. the question can really a successful democracy exist with very polarized of citizenship with lots of people who are rich but also lots of people who are below the middle-class level the world is at a crossroads today that if it doesn't try to write a new social contract those who have been hurt the many many people who have been hurt will repel [Applause] there are a few places where all social strata come together but even where they do exist it doesn't mean that the pool the rich and the middle classes actually meet how are they doing they're playing tactically Costa Fiona has paid for a place in a luxury suite in Leipzig main soccer stadium we in the luxury area of paying for their cheaper tickets through our high contributions everyone makes their own contribution maybe that guy pays 20 years for a ticket I'm actually paying 2,000 for mine there's a certain justice there now at the family office in Frankfort the bank's own Forester has come to call I brought all the figures let's start with Finland Christian fund bechtolsheim has been using his clients money to buy up forests in Finland New Zealand and Uruguay what's benefited us you can see it here in the timber prices in Finland the development last year spruce and pine have seen a huge increase since 2016 and that works to our advantage the Sweden solution copy mm-hmm authorities German forests are just insanely expensive there are very few areas available and when an area opens up people jump on it like crazy surprises a double tripled quadrupled over the past 10 or 15 years of course this is also due to the low interest rates that we currently have people are looking for everything they can find where can you invest money where can you safely invested or invested very profitably it's an intrinsic conflict can we briefly talked about Uruguay how does the return look relative to our plans we're doing quite well Uruguay is our most conservative projects this is a new global form of capitalism financial capitalism to find out how the system works sociology stat Brooke Harrington first trained as an asset manager it's a global profession and that's why I had to go to 18 different countries you know from the Cayman Islands and the BVI all the way out to the Cook Islands in the middle of the South Pacific to the Seychelles and Mauritius to New York and London and Switzerland all over one of the things you learn in wealth management school is to regard the world as kind of a legal financial shopping mall and you go to each different state in the world the way you would go to shops in a mall picking out the laws and the conditions that are most favorable for what you want to do or what your client wants to do with a particular asset so what you have to know is a wealth manager is where's the best place to get the laws that you need to do what you want to do with the art collection or the yacht or the family business the family office is the starting point of a global investment chain the wealthy entrust from best all time with their money among other things he invests with these fund managers they send it all around the world ensuring it earns much more interest than say a normal savings account I'm glad that you're here to say it at the outset we are really satisfied with the performance you have achieved so far currently we are at nine point three percent since the beginning of the year they say the secret of their fund is automated investment they have an algorithm that scans the global economic situation and converts it into traffic light signals green means the computer buys a lot of shares and when the signal jumps to yellow will read fewer yeah the curve is flat and you can see it because the signal isn't dark green we do the market timing we are the ones who ensure that a customer can re-enter the market because we operate without emotion we have no emotions our entire set up our entire algorithm is purely quantitative normal geopolitical upheavals such as those in Syria or Ukraine none of them has such a global economic dimension that it could really knock the world economy out of sync and that's our benchmark where we would intervene in the traffic light it has to be an event that knocks the world economy off-balance and at least in history no conventional war has done that many people would now say here are six well-to-do people sitting at the table and all they're doing is trying to increase their wealth for many you are kind of an economic bloat what would you say to them frankly nothing because no one ever asks net I think it's pretty tricky in Germany everyone thinks he can join Deutsche Bank as a trainee at 18 then become an authorised signatory and then eventually a department head and then retire at the age of 65 as a class-b director with a palm tree in the office and a chair with arm rests that world is definitely over that's for sure in the context of modern investor capitalism there's been this massive shift of power from labor to investment it's called financialization dissonance cloud these are very clear elements of an artificial world for which only an abstract amount of money counts a vanished but not the quality of life locally among the peoples in the markets in society now you can get rich from being a rentier capitalist that is not from your work not from the sweat of your brow as they say but from putting your money at the right place and at the right time the right things Tomasz class has been working as an engineer for siemens for nine years he sits on the works council and could imagine staying here until he retires with or without a palm tree we have employees who have been trained here they've worked here all their lives it's like a family it's not just work it's a bit of family and a bit of life the staff and I are very attached to what we do here together during the day good mind some - just recently Siemens posted six billion euros in annual profits but then worrying rumors began circulating investors were reportedly putting pressure on the company saying this plant wasn't fit for the future actually nothing is secure even everyday life living in a rented apartment is insecure we're currently secured by a single income and that is now on very very shaky legs you suddenly realize that when you get a situation like the one we're in now students really insist [Music] a few streets away from the Siemens plant cassava corner has invited all his staff to the company Christmas party he just bought this old post office railway station his wife Anna and his youngest daughter are the first to show up then the boss arrives a lot is riding on him his employees are also worried for much the same reasons as Thomas Klaus in recent weeks the financial Press reported that investors have taken over 50% of the company's shares [Applause] before though dear friends family it's amazing to be able to stand among you you are my motivation seasoned minam will to pursue is easy where my strength yeah I think you have been convinced by a letter from the management perhaps signed by me that we are still the same family no matter who owns the shares no matter who will have a say and so forth yes we do Capital Markets yes we have to refinance ourselves yes we have to reposition ourselves I will also be doing that no matter in what post I will be available to you in the future what we have achieved so far as to be a truly great and big family have a nice evening and thank you at some point every company reaches a certain size where its banking and financing structures are no longer sufficient I have to deal with the financial institutions and all that if I have that under control then I will remain in my post but if I don't then I'll be voted out faster than you can possibly imagine [Music] it looks like the whole world is being shaken up by big money it's a game that few can play and even fewer can win but when those at the top stopped a jump ship and those below have to worry about a crash what effect does that have on a country today and in the future [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

58,0,Inequality: how wealth becomes power (3/3) | (Poverty Richness Documentary) DW Documentary,"How much power do people with a lot of money really have? Who decides how Germany should look? These questions are the subject of the film """"Land of Inequality - Power.” Many studies show that a small but wealthy part of society defines a country’s political direction. It’s the same all over the world. German researchers evaluated hundreds of opinion polls on the topics of the economy, environment, foreign policy and finance. They then examined what poor people wanted from politics on these issues - and what the rich did. The differences were clear: """"An obvious example is taxes on property,” says Armin Schäfer, a political scientist at the University of Munster. """"Higher income groups are more skeptical about any reintroduction of a property tax, whereas lower income groups definitely want it. So far, we have not reintroduced a property tax in that form.” So who gets to decide what Germany looks like? To find out, our film follows building contractor Christoph Gröner, who has made millions from the construction business. Gröner wants to build an entire new district in Cologne, which is facing a severe housing shortfall and where rents are soaring and the poor in particular feel ignored. But he has faced delays in getting building permits. Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker says: """"It is a city’s job to provide land and grant building permits.” But can’t it do that faster? Gröner says the politicians should take their foot off the brakes. To show how much power money really wields, we go to the places where politics and economics come together - to the district town halls and the VIP box at a Bundesliga stadium. And to Europe's largest real estate show in Cannes, where billionaire investors use their financial clout to shape cities and regions as they wish.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Hoffmann is on top of the project and will be submitting our building application in November okay but starting construction July first is a bit late isn't it processing the application generally takes 12 months I'd still try to speed things up oh yeah wherever we can but the city has said clearly they need to prioritize tasks because they're understaffed that's not good enough then we'll have to meet the mayor I want that permit by spring I won at March 30th we break ground April first I want to move in 18 months later experience has shown no in this case I'm not bothered by experience [Music] cleaners cologne project illustrates a common dilemma companies want to build apartments that maximize profits tenants want apartments they can afford the city government has invited residents of Cologne to a local gym for a meeting to discuss the future of their city and identify the issues that are important to them I can't afford tenure as a square meter the evenings host is colognes mayor inria tulika lost time here - conversation centers on the divide between rich and poor I understand your position but we can't tell people where to live or when to move everyone has to decide that for themselves for many years local governments sought to ensure the supply of affordable housing by building themselves then a wave of privatization swept across Germany in the 1990s and investors took over but the city needs thousands of flats which is why mayor Baker needs Kuna City has a duty to provide the space and building permits needed to ensure sustainability in the housing market we haven't yet managed to attract enough investors how do you respond to investors who say either you let us have our way or we'll take our project elsewhere investors investors do that but they know I'm open to negotiation and what about mystic Luna and that building permit he's waiting for several times a year and we trying to reach agreement and lay out the next steps are you both satisfied now we're at least optimistic the meeting in the gym reveals that in the struggle against rising rents many residents feel abandoned politicians who decides today what the Germany of tomorrow will look like who really wields power in Germany we asked residents in Duisburg and live say [Music] this is what members of the German parliament thought their answers would be Macan politicians I think people wouldn't say politicians because they know politicians don't hold any power I'm sure too few said that they're the ones who have power business the 1% the corporation's they said corporations should be the people but it's capital the corporations it's not politicians they're just figure heads the ones with the money do you find these answers frustrating no because it's true they're right but that's a problem for democracy it worries me yes you guys you've read rather they believe that politicians could take the responsibility you fightin for dr. Jameson of the gig I think we need to do something to show them we're not running after the money so to speak understand it in two hands near the Parliament building the battle for power and influence also plays out on the real estate market Florian Schmidt is on his way home he's not looking forward to the evening ahead [Music] tonight his own home is a ring for the round of the real-estate power fight [Music] sympathy was nice enough the two coming to see the flat like stereotypical Anglophone hipsters from abroad the visitors are interested in buying the flat that Florian Schmidt rents so they'll come in and then take a look at the flat it should be a brief affair it's a small apartment only sixty square meters the parents sleep on the pullout in the living room their 7 year old son and 4 year old daughter sleep next door this is where the kids sleep but my little desk is there too Lauren Schmidt moved in here when he was still a student now the flat is up for sale the potential buyers have arrived you're from the real estate agency yes the agent arranged the appointment his clients wish to remain anonymous they're from abroad and want to invest in Berlin's property market Florian Schmidt is a member of the Green Party and the councillor responsible for urban development public space and facility management in his district free design courts back mr. Schmidt are you surprised that being a politician doesn't exempt you from the danger of being driven out of your rental no not at all and that wouldn't be good either being a politician shouldn't guarantee preferential treatment he holds no grudge against the prospective buyers the problem lies elsewhere so I just want to make it clear to you it's not against you it's more against not against you it's assistant has lots of conditions what as a tenant Schmidt knows he'll probably be the loser in this round but as a politician Schmidt has a different opponent Christoph g'loona who wants to build in his district many local residents opposed the plans of course I'm somewhat wary of such people's because they produce a kind of urban environment that doesn't correspond to the type of environment we want to live in we say that it would be best if buildings were owned by the people who live in them and not by people looking to extract a profit from them the same applies to new buildings we want people who live in the building's to own these buildings as coops we're working for the people while mr. Koerner works for his shareholders Florian Schmidt dreams of a city where real estate is in the hands of housing cooperatives and small property owners Gruner bought this former post office tower in Schmidt's district with the intention of installing hundreds of apartments at the time of filming this report he'd locked horns over the development with Schmidt who believed voters and politicians should have a say Gruner complained the district was delaying the building permit he found a lucrative interim solution though by renting a few floors out as office space on this day he was using that space to host a new year's event [Music] his plans foresaw luxury apartments in the tower with welfare housing relegated to adjacent buildings nice to see you he's become my secret weapon every day each of the individuals standing up here go that extra mile they sacrifice vacation time get in trouble with their partners at home because they can't explain why or because they're suspected of having joined a sect so I'd like to say a big thank you to you my colleagues and now please return to the audience so that everyone can see me please councillor florian schmidt was also invited to the reception I got a message from ploy on Schmidt last night telling me you wouldn't be able to make it mainly because of family reasons maybe another opportunity to meet can be arranged I'm ready and willing I'd be happy to have a chance to talk ploy on Schmidt is a representative of the people sent by his political party so basically he's just a prisoner of his own circumstances of his party and his district I wouldn't want to be in his shoes if I were I'd do things differently this is the district free design cords back Florian Schmitz district I don't know where things stand mister Corona is meeting the urban planning committee next week so maybe that will be a good time Lauren Schmidt was once an activist who attended demonstrations against big business and its representatives people like una today he uses his role in city government to steer development in an equitable direction but he can't build the needed living space himself the district has acquired a few buildings but its budget is small so he needs investors this is a gas station by the canal today the department is discussing a different project here we're talking about closing a gap with the hotel ok well we need to put a big question mark behind that tearing down houses that people live in is just the kind of thing we don't want to be doing so I'd ask you to not give any recommendations of how this could work to listen if none at all ok Joyner and Schmidt plan to meet soon to discuss how to move forward with the formal postal office building it's unclear how that conversation will go is wealth power we are absolutely at a crossroads right now in the 21st century in this very year given the socio-political forces that are operating on a global scale and of course that leads into the political issue political inequality that stems from wealth inequality you hear a lot about how wealthy people seek to influence elections and that is certainly a very real and serious problem but it's much bigger than that studies in the u.s. have shown that the wealthy steer the direction of the country if the rich elite has a policy objective it very often gets what it wants whatever the elite doesn't favor is likely to fall through even if it's backed by the lower income majority [Music] is the same true in Germany I mean Schaefer is a political scientist who's investigated this question we were surprised to find that the situation in Germany is skewed in much the same way as described in the US study Bundestag lawmakers have consistently geared their decisions to the interests of higher income earners and higher tier jobs and the interests of people who are less or belong to socially disadvantaged groups are systematically given less consideration and the stomata srinagar offered what policies did this impact the researchers conducted hundreds of surveys on topics ranging from the economy and environment to Foreign Affairs and finance they grouped subjects into rich and poor and asked each to define their desired policy outcome in what area was a divergence most noticeable I don't feel as well next is an obvious example the higher and individuals income the less likely they will be to support a reintroduction of the wealth tax whereas lower income earners definitely want it back to this day we haven't seen the return of such a wealth tax we're winding up with the government of the 1% for the 1% and by the 1% at the football stadium in life seche gustav g'loona has rented a box where his single-seat costs 10,000 euros per season it's a place to cut business deals [Applause] the game is on gwenna uses the time to network how are you I can't complain he's often scored goals himself up here like recently with another major project that had hit a snag we bumped into the city finance minister and had a very polite but firm conversation with him two weeks later we met at his office and found a solution that was for a 350 million euro investment in the end politicians know that it's here in these halls that they'll meet the decision-makers from the business world people who ultimately have a say in and are responsible for urban development right now we still have more than a billion to place in the land of inequality ordinary people sit in the bleachers while the movers and shakers seal their deals and private boxes [Applause] here in the stadium lapses we'll end up losing this game but the deal that counts for Christophe Kelowna takes place at another venue the berlin district office of heedless and courts burg corner has an appointment with councillors Schmidt closed-door talks have been going on for hours Karuna wants his building permit Schmidt wants voters to have a say we talked we don't have a deal yet but we took a first step today how do you see it you've pretty much summed it up the meeting is over but Christophe greener and Florian Schmidt stay behind for a one-on-one colognes carnival is the icebreaker the businessman dons a costume in the annual parade it brings back memories for the politician my mother would dress the whole family up as dying trees in the 80s now it's time to cut to the chase my problems with mr. Schmidt arise when he gets a building permit that he has to sign and he doesn't sign it it just doesn't sign I don't think that's okay I think that's when he should have the guts to say yes I'm a politician and I'm in the green party but right now mr. guna has a right to his building permit so whether I like it or not I'm going to sign I'd say there are at least two ways to see that other people would say I have guts precisely because I'm not signing the building permit people feel frustrated and I sort of do too even though now I make a decent living I live in a small apartment and I'm looking to move and there's simply nothing on the market appeal or if there is something a hundred people are waiting in line hey we'd be welcome to rent one of our flats we'll see but I do feel that ultimately what's happening here is a struggle for power and attention for you too I don't think we'll be assessed by how well we played our hand at some point someone is going to count Apartments and I'd like to be assessed on those merits does money change people's behavior it's a question social psychologist Paul piff has been researching for years for one of his experiments he enlisted hundreds of people to play a rigged game of Monopoly what we did in this game of Monopoly was just manipulate with the flip of a coin whether some people were rich or other people were poor we randomly assigned one person to be this rich player in this rigged game so they got two times the money to play the game they got to roll both dice instead of one to move around the board and what we found is that across all of these different sessions richer players made more noise as they moved around the board they took up more space in the room with their bodies we had a bowl of pretzels the richer players took more pretzels and they are more likely to be talking to the other person with their mouths full when we asked them to describe why they'd won they were way less likely to talk about those external forces those features of the environment their luck that random flip of a coin that had gotten them into that privileged position in the first place and they were more likely far more likely to talk about what they did their own skills their own talents their own successes their own wherewithal their own acumen the decisions they made in the game the world as a boardgame Christophe Cunha is flying to France for one of the most important events on his annual calendar the real estate exhibition in Caen I could cut to the front was my very self important person past but I won't tickets to the fair cost 2000 euros their investors pledged hundreds of billions of euros many politicians depend on businessman like Kona now he's about to meet the people he depends on the property market takes place right next to the yacht harbor investors from all over the world attend it's their money that decides which cities will get new buildings and revive districts and when miniature models seeking big investors the mayor of Cologne Henriette Rika is also here the issue of the building permit for Christopher owners Colonia is settled he says he'll have it by the beginning of July he's satisfied in Kannan Henriette Rika is meeting other investors one every half hour mr. mayhem is the biggest property fair in the world as a growing city we rely on investors to build our properties so we have to showcase ourselves we have to share what cologne has to offer henrietta lakers cologne pitch is directed at a list investors sovereign wealth fund managers and pension fund executives Christophe Cunha does not want his meetings at the fair to be filmed here in Caen it's evident that there is no longer such a thing as the economy today there's the real economy where for example people build houses in which other people live and then there's the financial economy where property is just another asset to turn money into more money the business journalist hands Jurgen Jakob spent years creating a who's who of the world's richest investors and found out who owns the world the world belongs to those who've mastered the art of using other people's money to turn a profit for themselves in the most efficient way possible I'm livid it's you this is how the asymmetrical ratio between the real and the financial economies has developed in the early 70s the two were still equal but by 1990 that ratio stood at two-to-one in 2000 it was 3 to 1 in 2017 the world's financial assets amounted to approximately 300 trillion dollars the real economy is worth just 80 trillion dollars meaning the ratio is now almost 4 to 1 like banks asset managers have grown increasingly powerful the biggest investment firm is Blackrock black rocks holdings for example includes 6% of Siemens shares almost equal to the amount held by the Siemens family in fact Blackrock holds shares in every company listed on the German Stock Exchange and major global companies in total Blackrock has assets amounting to some six trillion dollars meaning it manages more capital than the combined state revenues of the US Britain and Germany [Music] something has shifted if investors control more money than the world's wealthiest nations they have power power that politicians can no longer rein in this universe advisor ina constipated to a certain extent it's an artificial world the people in New York Chicago or Los Angeles who control International Finance capitalism have virtually no contact with the realities of a company or consumer market sweep cut in item for poha macht they're juggling abstract astronomically high figures and trying to meet abstract targets that's the world they live in and all's well in their world as long as the numbers look good it's evening in Caen Christophe Cunha is hosting a party in the yacht harbor goona finances his multi-billion euro projects with bank loans but he also needs investors money a very warm welcome to everyone thank you for coming tonight now it's his turn to pitch when it comes to bidding more often at a disadvantage sometimes we don't land the contract for a really big project why because there are other parties with dubious intentions they buy it divided up and somehow make a few extra euros selling the pieces and the result is a scattering of overpriced properties what we need is fast financing we need cheap money and for that I need you esteemed bank managers and investors I need your support it concerns me that there are more and more parties who aren't interested in creating added value they just want to do business and there's nothing illegal about that per se but they're stronger than we are Christophe Cunha has made millions in property development but investors bankroll billions he has to defend his decisions before politicians as well [Music] the investors who control the money are virtually invisible tonight not one agrees to an interview it's a new world order back in Berlin first of Luna is jockeying to keep up with the global competition he's just arrived from talks with an investor we were in London today and shook things up we did very well with our partners sorry I can't stop smiling you know it's always a tough game again in which only a select few get a share of the prize [Music] people sense correctly that the control of their nation is being stolen from them they sense this all over the world and they're not wrong that's food duties and it's making people feel like they've been left behind like they no longer belong and they view the future with despair we see it in the drop-in party membership as well as in election results and I think it's a very dangerous development it's batali your to be stinking rents and property prices are rising salaries for the most part are not there is a nagging suspicion that politicians are no longer the ones writing the rules opting out of the democratic system is one form of protest here in lapses and induce book residents were asked if they vote kind of what does that mean depends on the situation I didn't vote last time because honestly the system is to correct of course if immigrants my whole life I went to vote if I was even in a political party for 30 years Pataki but in recent years I felt really let down by politicians did you vote last time no why not no time unfortunately no no because nothing gets done no matter who's up there nothing gets done says Alexander Hospital of baby Bella and an older daughter in school Alexandra Hospital mother together with her friend Marcos Zog she shows us their live safe neighborhood of cleaner so it's nice here it's I wouldn't say it's nice what's not nice here the prefabs aren't nice yes the prefabs define the neighborhood I agree that's a con so pros cons even we do have quiet trams one out of three residents here didn't vote in the 2017 general election one of the lowest turnouts in Germany the majority of those who did cast a ballot voted for the far-right AFD party Alexandra when was the last time you voted yeah it's been cada a single one it was just after my 18th birthday manic was my older daughter had just been born I was so proud to be allowed to vote for the first time and I voted and in the last election no say you've completely stopped yes how come because there's no points more than anything Alexandra husbands had children to grow up to have a better life and more opportunities than she's had she's trained as a geriatric nurse Marquez Zork works in a large furniture store they have differing political views ordinary people are heard and seen but the rich hold more Swale for political parties and there are basically no rich single mums there are they just have nannies right you still have faith in the political system I do believe that I can change something with my little vote that's why I vote if I thought there was no possibility of changing anything at all I wouldn't go vote either what bugs me the most is the kindergarten and school situation does that there's no acknowledgement that it's harder for a single parent to have a proper job that feeds the family than it is for couples it's the money it's like this and as long as those conditions for single moms don't change I won't go vote but can democracy work if people don't participate Clovis I think there'll be a new order if people stop participating then what happens then instead of democracy we'll have what dictatorship what can happen if too many people believe they and their elected representatives no longer have any power Jasha monk is from Munich and teaches political science at Harvard University he studied the impact of inequality on democracy in Deutschland HUD see a lot has shifted in Germany 20 years ago only 16 percent of Germans favored having a strong leader who didn't bother with elections and Parliament that figure now stands at 33 percent researchers asked younger and older generations across the world how important it is to them to be living in a country that is governed democratically the results show that whether a person is from the US Poland the Netherlands or Spain the younger they are the less importance they attach to democracy in Germany two-thirds of people over 50 approve of democratic governance not even a third of subjects under 30 feel the same [Music] this map illustrates the number of people who did not vote in Germany's last general election the darker the red the more non-voters the second map shows how many people voted for the far-right AFD the darker the blue the more AFD voters two forms of protest for younger people it's all very abstract the idea that we could one day lose our democracy and end up with communism or fascism is unimaginable to them so they're more willing to experiment they think ok these people Trump from the AFD and even some in the far left parties I'm sure they're partially attacking things I actually support but it can't get too bad I was let's see what they do on remind us a tune that in Germany populist Tsar seizing the moment and echoing voters concerns like here in girl it's in Saxony where many are scared of losing their jobs the AFD has organized this rally the main political parties have stayed away it's infuriating when Zeman's closes plants here and moves them to the czech republic and we're sick of being a cheap labour region how many of you work from morning till night and still can't make ends meet [Applause] [Music] she mentioned a lot of people are asking what about us where are our fates being decided do we still have an identity to home where are those decisions being made somewhere else entirely people are are angry and they're angry for good reason in a lot of European and North American countries but the their attention has been diverted to things that aren't really the source of their anger and frustration and that's the dangerous part I think we have learned lessons from the past that we should not let this inequality go out of bounds we're the only solution is really a destructive one solutions are needed before populism lures voters with the false promise of a quick fix but who can offer such solutions would it help to raffle off a few seats in the German parliament among ordinary citizens should cities be building affordable housing without the help of investors should wealth be taxed after all kirsta Fiona wants to continue pulling the strings that shape Germany's future maybe even more openly than he is today do you feel powerful yes who's more powerful you or politicians I guess business managers are more powerful isn't or more powerful because we're independent I'd like to enter politics someday do you already have a plan for that climb founding a party right now really yes I think we'll soon reach a point and when it'll be important for actors currently working behind the scenes to step out onto the stage

59,0,Climate change in the Antarctic | DW Documentary,"Few places on Earth are as remote as the German research facility Neumayer Station III. The scientists who work at this outpost in Antarctica are studying the effects of climate change -- under extreme conditions.Journalist Matthias Ebert traveled to the station to find out more about their research. The scientists are particularly concerned about the speed at which Antarctic ice is melting - and its impact on global sea levels. The researchers have also been studying a large colony of emperor penguins that lives near their facility -- to find out more about how these birds are adapting to climate change. Ebert reports on the daily lives of the scientists who work at the Neumayer Station, and how they cope with the extreme weather conditions, isolation, and cramped quarters. They've even managed to grow some of their own food in a greenhouse at the facility.Ebert documents the damaging effect that global warming is having on the Antarctic, and the risk that this poses for the rest of the world. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Begich decker back when you first arrived you're sort of overwhelmed by the fact that you're in Antarctica but this place has been made as Germans there's possible for better or for worse and you can help yourself to typical German candy for instance and in the well-stocked pantry you can find food products that are available in any German supermarket dr. Begich decker bag is used to carrying out complex operations but up to now she's only had to carry out routine checks you don't have any insects here or any flu viruses we just have contact with the same eight people but in some cases when these people return home and encounter normal circumstances they'll find that their stay here has affected their immune system that's your net so came from had beer get worked as a surgeon at a hospital in Hanover for more than 20 years but was intrigued by a newspaper ad about a job offer at the NOI Meyer station she took the position after her four grown children gave their approval I asked myself whether I wanted to spend the rest of my career until my retirement doing the same morning rounds at the hospital it was time for something new the outdoor working conditions are extreme every day scientists Molly shot Luna and Osama Mustafa set off to do their research on penguins we always take along emergency supplies including a tent [Music] the ice here extends 200 meters beneath the surface [Music] a few kilometers away we see the first ice blows large expanses of white that float on the sea surface there's nothing here but ice and emperor penguins these birds thrive in this harsh habitat mahi Charlotte and Osama are studying this penguin colony on behalf of the German government's Environment Agency the birds breed in the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter the scientists are monitoring the chicks fate and using accidents on inside room would you at this point they've grown quite a bit and the parents often leave them alone while they go to look for food now that chicks are slowly starting to form groups amongst themselves and that will give them some protections mahi Charlotte and Osama are going to launch a drone to help them count how many penguins are in the colony the camera takes photographs at specific intervals ideally those pictures should have quite a bit of overlap so that afterwards we can take the photos and piece them together preliminary estimates put the population of this colony at about 26,000 the Penguins migrate to the frozen sea ice every year to breed and raise their young but some experts say that climate change could threaten the birds existence Mali Charlotte explains why for this particular colonies there's a real risk that the structure of the sea ice that they breed on will change if the temperature rises and the ice recedes or breaks up earlier than expected the Penguins breeding season will be cut short or maybe they'll have no place to breed at all that could threaten the future of the entire colony here it's important to us that people in Germany for example find out what is happening here and realize we need to protect these birds something has to be done now not in 30 years we've all finished and twice as much penguins have hardly any natural enemies in the Antarctic during the summer months emperor penguins forage the icy waters for food after breeding the male incubates the female single egg during some of the harshest winter weeks [Music] the researchers often find the carcasses of penguin chicks that have died in the extreme cold [Music] Alexander VIN tell in Benoit valise take the birds body back to their lab to try to determine the cause and time of death do you doesn't they probably died two or three months ago you can tell by their size their bodies are frozen so they've been well-preserved a lot of the chicks died young in these extreme conditions it's really tough here we found a lot of dead chicks that were the same size we suspect that they died at the same time maybe in a storm but despite the deaths of many chicks the colony's population has remained fairly stable for years Alexandre and Benoit are looking for some penguins that they tagged years ago either with GPS devices or rings on their feet that data will help researchers find out how far the birds travel to find food [Music] but today the researchers only come across more dead chicks this one probably died recently maybe just a few weeks ago will measure the carcass that beak length the wing length in the weight to determine their age at the time of death is the servation site for dt2 stab few other penguin colonies are studied as extensively as this one [Music] thermal imaging cameras and high-resolution lenses record the bird's movements especially during the winter months when they huddle together as fool's it seems funny the aim of each bird is to use as little energy as possible during the winter breeding season that's why they try to optimize their position in the colony what's fascinating is that the creatures managed without any hierarchy anyone telling them what to do to rotate their position in the group in a very orderly and collective way the researchers are concerned about the impact of global warming on the Antarctic sea ice because it could permanently damage the fragile ecological balance in the region thus if we meet the one point five or two degree target agreed in the Paris Convention we can save these birds if not they'll be extinct by 2100 the latest one the neue Meyer station requires a year-round maintenance the snow is being moved to the facilities underground garage and storage area to help shore up the basis of the 16 hydraulic columns on which the structure stands [Music] every year the technical crew raises the columns by about 100 centimeters to keep the structure above the surface of the snow and ice [Music] I like the way that science and technology interact here science needs technology but without science there would be no technology every year Holger Schubert gets the snow grooming machines ready for the summer season time is of the essence there are hundreds of kilometers of snow roads that need to be leveled but first the machines need a tune-up and it's minus 15 degrees out here today since its guns when it's really cold it's better to work in pairs so that you can keep an eye on each other's faces and look out for any signs of frostbite commitment or to four fabulous eating the researchers have adapted well to the extreme conditions electrical engineer Thomas shod has to keep everything up and running one of his most important tasks is to collect fresh snow and convert it into drinking water the snow that we brought in is melting now I want a temperature is about six degrees it'll be ready in two hours or so Tomas knows the station inside and out during the long winter months the skeleton crew has to be self-reliant among Thomas's duties the maintenance of the sewage and wastewater treatment equipment we will declare the above used purified wastewater in the flush toilets the water is so clean that you could drink it at least in theory criteria discrete pavia this is the station's heating system which keeps the facility at room temperature even during the coldest days the system is powered by three diesel generators the power plant also makes use of any waste heat that's generated and outside a wind turbine brings in even more electricity but up to now renewables only account for a quarter of the station's energy needs this is all in plan or mobile doesn't actually run we're working on introducing more wind energy and harnessing other sustainable resources it's very difficult in these conditions with these extreme temperatures and storms the wind turbine often ices up Mako's shu maha is an atmospheric chemist he has to walk a kilometer and a half everyday to reach a site where he takes no samples he's going to pound this plastic tube into the snow afterwards the sample will be carefully packed and shipped to Germany for analysis these tests are aimed at determining how new snow turns into glacial ice over time maca says it's pretty solitary work you spend a lot of time by yourself out here in the middle of nowhere and the weather conditions are extreme speeding the temperature can drop to minus 40 and there's the windchill effects with such odd vinta by marcus works in his own building which houses the air chemistry observatory he monitors the presence of greenhouse gases in the Antarctic atmosphere listen here we have four big pumps that feed air into four different filtration systems Marcos records the increase in soot particles for example during large fires in the Amazon rainforest but his main focus is on carbon dioxide and other compounds that can damage the Earth's atmosphere we measure the co2 and then capture the molecules in a sodium hydroxide solution this milky liquid here that's as it's diesel Michigan Smith subscribe by analyzing the individual atoms maquas can determine where the carbon dioxide comes from overall he's seen a significant rise in co2 levels known to be a major contributor to global warming this steep increase doesn't just represent a serious problem for the areas where these gases are produced the industrial regions of the northern hemisphere those materials have now spread around the world and we've even found them here in Antarctica for years scientists like Makos have been calling attention to the increase in greenhouse gases but politicians have failed to take action this is a second it's a scary situation because we've observed this increase and we actually know what impact it will have despite our best efforts no one is willing to stand up and do something to try and stop it scientists that's not only scary it's really depressing you take your measurements collect your data and you report your findings and those facts are just ignored [Music] this frustration is why Marquess organized what is almost certainly the world's southernmost climate change protesting he and his colleagues here at no Meyer station wanted to show their support for young people around the world were also taking part in demonstrations maybe at the far end of the planet but even this far-flung part of the world is being affected by climate change a photograph with symbolic power meteorologist Michelle cough is responsible for determining what impact global warming might already be having on the Antarctic atmosphere for his research he collects data that include wind speed solar radiation and the reflective properties of the ice crust German scientists have been taking such measurements in the Antarctic since the early 1980s these reports are sent to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change vendhya the schema spacing when we talk about climate we have to look at data over a period of at least 30 years one year's worth of information simply isn't enough captain Stonyfield echidnas here michio is getting ready to launch a weather balloon it goes up every morning at 11 o'clock and measures air temperature and the density of the ozone layer to an altitude of up to 30 kilometers Michio says that so far his data show no evidence of global warming here at this specific spot under stats own at this station we haven't recorded any changes in temperature many other research stations in Antarctica haven't either but there has been a sizable increase in temperature in the Antarctic Peninsula the Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of the continent researcher there has shown this rise in temperatures has led to accelerate a glacial melting if it's coupled with ocean warming this could have a serious impact on the sea ice where penguins live and breed ocean warming could also further accelerate the melting of the glaciers this would contribute to rising global sea levels the scientists at the NOI Maia station are making a substantial contribution to the complex research required in these fields but they're also studying how to grow vegetables and other produce in this harsh environment this is the Eden ISS project a hi-tech greenhouse that may one day provide astronauts with the technology they'll need to cultivate plants during extended space missions after you've been here for a few weeks in the darkness and you've only seen white it's a wonderful experience coming in here with the smell it makes you think of being on vacation in Italy when you open the window it's great tomatoes peppers and cucumbers grow without soil the plants exposed roots are sprayed with a nutrient solution this is a real luxury for us since June we've been able to serve fresh lettuce every evening later we added tomatoes and cucumbers people love it a mother a few Florida beloved chef Catalina noun Dorf says that this is probably the world's southernmost vegetable garden finding the s and after the first harvest we celebrated we used to have letters flown in from Cape Town but we hadn't had any for at least a month so this was a real event for people is saying finally something green Don Varas from vidoes Alliance war was greener here Catalina is even preparing a dish with fresh pesto made with basil leaves from the greenhouse the other ingredients come from the freezer the researchers here are laying the groundwork for the development of plant cultivation technology that may be used in the future onboard the International Space Station Catalina enjoys her work at NOAA Maya but she does get homesick sometimes my oldest nephew got married recently but I had to stay here I wish I could have been there I really wanted to go so you do miss your loved ones Sport is one distraction regular workouts at the research stations gym help keep the staff in good physical and mental shape do your physicist ediot quagga tries to get everyone involved I can't just sit around for a whole year and do nothing so we all ended up coming down here to get food at first it was really hard and we all cursed eded but now we love her [Laughter] staff at the NOI mayer station can also look forward to a drink at the end of the day but they have to accept they'll have the same drinking buddies for months on end the Mandel if you prefer to avoid people you don't belong here as your combat feel and plot is very small group that we all depend on each other we have to help each other are they heaven and we really need to have a strong team spirit if Tiger team to some note give fact [Music] and so ends another day at the NOI Maya station a unique research facility located in one of the coldest and most remote places on earth

60,0,Kiribati: a drowning paradise in the South Pacific | DW Documentary,"Climate change and rising sea levels mean the island nation of Kiribati in the South Pacific is at risk of disappearing into the sea. But the island’s inhabitants aren’t giving up. They are doing what they can to save their island from inundation. Can COP23 help make a difference?UN estimates indicate that Kiribati could disappear in just 30 or 40 years. That’s because the average elevation is less than two meters above sea level. And some of the knock-on effects of climate change have made the situation more difficult. Kiribati can hardly be surpassed in terms of charm and natural beauty. There are 33 atolls and one reef island – spread out over an area of 3.5 million square kilometers. All have white, sandy beaches and blue lagoons. Kiribati is the world’s largest state that consists exclusively of atolls. A local resident named Kaboua points to the empty, barren land around him and says, """"There used to be a large village here with 70 families."""" But these days, this land is only accessible at low tide. At high tide, it's all under water. Kaboua says that sea levels are rising all the time, and swallowing up the land. That’s why many people here build walls made of stone and driftwood, or sand or rubbish. But these barriers won't stand up to the increasing number of storm surges. Others are trying to protect against coastal erosion by planting mangrove shrubs or small trees. But another local resident, Vasiti Tebamare, remains optimistic. She works for KiriCAN, an environmental organization. Vasiti says: """"The industrialized countries -- the United States, China, and Europe -- use fossil fuels for their own ends. But what about us?"""" Kiribati's government has even bought land on an island in Fiji, so it can evacuate its people in an emergency. But Vasiti and most of the other residents don't want to leave._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

We have to build a higher wall So the water doesn't flood our home In the past our wall kept breaking because it was only this high now it's higher and more stable It protects us from the sea many walls collapse at high tide, but we're lucky our walls still standing In just 30 years tear tates wall could cease to offer any protection from the sea The island state of carry bass is one of the lowest lying countries on earth the narrow Unprotected atolls in the South Pacific are on average only 2 metres above sea level the nation consists of 33 such attles spread out between Hawaii and Australia more than half its hundred thousand residents live on the Tarawa Atoll, but for how much longer Climate change is threatening the people of Kiribati Sea levels are rising storm surges and severe tropical storms are flooding the sparsely populated country with increasing frequency For the locals, it's a question of survival Climate change has national priority for the government of Kira bas Joy, eating has been the official climate commissioner since 2010. He's alarmed by the changes caused by climate change It is warned that you know the community has to live in these conditions, you know, um, I would imagine you know, there would be a lot of uh sanitation problems a lot of contamination of the drinkable water Right now we don't really Have a king tide, you know, you know rising sea, you know They will let the during this period but imagine when it does come, you know And and that little seawall there is fully, you know submerged by by by water One day the people of Kiribati will have to leave their country the government has already purchased land on Fiji to provide them with refuge Everyday to Tower and his three brothers have to carry their fishing boat into the sea. It's hard work As you can see this area's flooded all this from here to all the way back there used to be beach Now the beach is gone and the rocks are washed up. That's why we have to move our boat everyday. Otherwise, it would get smashed The family defies the rising sea levels with a coral wall that resembles a fortress But with that the water is rising and rising Eventually the land over there will disappear, but we'll stay and float like an island in the water Tower and his family have become a symbol of Kira bosses' fight for survival His mother my entire and her granddaughter Anna often reminisce about the times before they were affected by climate change Twenty years ago the sea was far away we were safe back then even at high tide the water only reached this far We used to have a lot of trees. Our land was much greener. We had no idea we'd have to live like this one day The access road has been flooded for years the family can only leave their property by boat But so what when I was little life here was really good there were lots of trees under which we played hide-and-seek I've heard that other countries are causing climate change, but I don't hate those people It that way I see it differently the Western countries are doing many things to cause climate change they're to blame All I can do is ask them to stop The sea is increasingly devouring unprotected tracts of land in the middle of the South Pacific This isn't a safe place for the future When we have a high tide and a big storm the water smashes into the seawall and sprays over the top During storm surges which occur once a month these days the people of Kiribati defenseless against the forces of nature I'm scared that the water will continue to rise. Maybe we'll have to leave here one day and live elsewhere if climate change gets worse a Mangrove forest in the south of Tarawa There knots of thin strong roots make these tropical trees the perfect protection against soil erosion With a group of young people climate activists varsity team Amari wants to plant mangroves on the beach at amble during low tide Will plant 15 rows You have to plant the mangroves are hands width apart The city has been organizing a growing number of such volunteer planting events Okay, these are the seats from the mangroves and we picked them up and then these are the ones that we used to plant them And then they grow again we take three in case cuz when we replant them the waves will come and maybe two will be flooded away at least one will stay and be and will live so that's why we Take three all the time The people of Tarawa have already planted more than 50,000 mangroves on the beaches of the at all The young people here have grown up with climate change they're scared Period important I Just don't want to see Milan get round everything. Yes in my village way I live goes after The future prospects for Curie basses young people are dire, but none of them want to leave their home I'm so proud of you killing us Even though what we faced with it still proud of a country. This is where we belong It's our culture our identities. That's why I think this is where our hearts belong The hope is that these Mangroves on Ambo Beach will grow into a forest like the one that helps defy storm surges in the south of Tarawa Protecting the coastline has become a national priority for the people of Kiribati But there's no coherent plan and the government lacks the funds for long-term infrastructure measures Those who can afford concrete have built a wall at their own expense That's what it in when we has done a young entrepreneur from the village of table Oreo. I Think climate change will only get worse in the future One day Curie bars will drown when other people think differently, but I'm scared by what's happening. We have to protect ourselves That's why we're building the seawall this high The sea is calm today, but it's only a matter of time before the next storm surge arrives Terawatt is home to around 60,000 people more than half the country's entire population Livable land is becoming increasingly sparse says climate activists of a city Compared to ten years ago it not just like bliss people stayed in their homelands, but nowadays people migrate from there for a better future They give me a poor education for where for everything, and now it ended up like this and one live closely to each other In addition to climate change overpopulation is one of the biggest problems on Tarawa This is easily passed from one person to another and especially with the future of the kids The governments have a limits resource It can't employ each and every one of them on average a family here has five to six children Almost every square meter of land on Tarawa has now been built on the main thing That is strengthening us is the sea level rise. We have land erosion The sea is taking most of the lands and people here try whatever they have to build sea walls But it doesn't help when the water comes. No one can stop the water. It just comes and then take away all the lands again In 2014 the effects of global warming on kiri bus attracted international attention Yo, annotate iota made a bid to become the world's first climate change refugee when he applied for asylum in New Zealand The government of New Zealand didn't recognise climate change as grounds for asylum They didn't think that the people of kerry bus were threatened by nature and forced to flee as a result Yawara and his family were deported from New Zealand a year later Even though the situation in their home country has been getting progressively worse. It was a shock for the family What scares me is that our land is low-lying we're surrounded by the sea And it's being washed away around us Yoanna and his family have moved in with his sister, but they don't see a future for themselves on Kiera bas My biggest worry is my children. I want them to be safe. We don't want to wait until the end Many people criticize me for trying to be a climate change refugee saying I'm talking my country down But I want to leave again. It doesn't matter where we live our culture will survive with us Kirra buses first inhabitants settled here around three thousand years ago. The majority came from Southeast Asia and Polynesia The locals are a proud people who are attached to their traditions a By an atoll around 50 kilometers to the north of Tarawa is a different world, it's only sparsely populated The village of tübingen Akko has become a symbol of the impending dangers of climate change Over the past 20 years rising sea levels have destroyed kebab Jon's home Long time ago this is that land before and they used to have money a big house for like gathering people parties occasions and all the people before they live here and now they all move to tada the mainland Topanga narco is still home to 70 families. It was the second largest village on a by, yang Rising salinity from daily flooding has made the soil infertile Before I don't care about climate change when I hate about climate chat at all It's nothing and now I see the difference You know the impact and it's like worrying me and I know I'm thinking maybe I'm gonna move migrate to another Australia or New Zealand another country because the sea rising they're always increasing I Have two kids and then when I look for the kid then maybe I should move But Cabo wants to stay. It's not a question of courage. He just feels connected to his home We are from Kiev s we are proud to be the best we want to die here We don't want to go to overseas. We want to stay here When we move our culture we would be disappear There are lots of people on a buying who don't have work Cabarrus here on behalf of the government his job is to show people how to make palm sugar Hambo gonna be I know there was an Ogre boa is looking for a worker named Turk. Amber Palm sugar is obtained from the SAP known locally as 2 D of the palm blossom Tech amber has to climb to the top of a 20 meter coconut palm to collect it I'm do you mean up tech amber has three bottles of Tori's so far? That's enough for now Cibola learned how to make palm sugar in Thailand the government of kiri bas financed his training The Kirov US government also paid for the equipment here. This is a idea first one Accord them Up until now locals have only used the fresh palm syrup for drinks No, we're going to apply the fresh water a fresh story so Connor we want to eat we operate those, you know the water in the in uh, In the in the doggy so that we can crystallize the doggy Become suka, you know the soft parts The island of ABBA, yang is the perfect place for producing palm sugar there are thousands of coconut palms across the 37 kilometers You know cobra-cabra cutting as a source of income so our con men try to find ways which can help people like to win more money and this is one of the One of the income no income for the farmers It takes seven liters of SAP to produce one kilogram of palm sugar This is how you have to do it when you've reached this point, the fire mustn't be too hot You have to stir it the whole time Watch how I do it You have to push the tody up the side until it becomes hard and powdery The palm sugar from a by yang is set to be sold for five euros per kilo We'll continue with this work we can earn money that way and we can use that money to feed our families or He could be one this one is really quickly The government has plans to export the palm sugar from a bi hang around the world cub Our secured important contacts at the World's Fair in Milan in 2015 This is the sugar from your palm sap, this is what it looks like You want to try it What do you think of the new sugar it's not bad, right? Do you like it it tastes like candy this sugar is really different much more delicious Traditional caravans recipes are increasingly fading from memory women's rights activists and nutritionists Tonga fitty cross wants to fight that trend to Teach them how to eat food and how to prepare food with this they never do it before and to using the leaves in the Hips that they am their own country and they never use it because they don't know it that they eat a bowl You can use these palm leaves in many different ways not just to swat flies We'll wrap them around the fish Rip the leaves into two when you cook these leaves a liquid comes out that's very good for the stomach any guy Gonna fold the leaves like this and wrap the fish company nylon Fish has been prepared like this on kiri bass for generations He usually eats right food before but they went they imported food comes and that's where things has gone wrong because in Garages that the hospital is full of people to sick people and we try to cut down there the people too sick you know and receive the rightful so cut on tiem lack of vitamin Cynthia and their food and not The acanti they can't prevent any any disease You can eat every part of the squash the flower the stem the skin the seeds when you cut the squash Make sure you don't cut the slices too thickly Why do we want a lot of hugs in our soup? All these herbs have medicinal properties Your bodies take in these herbs and you get healthier, yeah, yeah, you're gonna okay not even oh boy You're not just making a meal. You are also making medicine dropper toy America Dharma pingatore America tour today at Two-thirds of kirov asses population consumes a staple diet of fish and imported rice a diet increasingly supplemented with high sugar foods Leading to rising rates of obesity and diabetes Soon-im got a body. I thank Tonga Fiji for this cooking class. I know more about cooking now I have a young daughter at home I'll cook with a lot of herbs and vegetables now so that she grows up healthy Up until now, we've only used these herbs for our customs. We didn't know you could cook them You can find everything she's showing us in the jungle. It's grandma one dependend afternoon everyone like their net out Nutritionist Tonga feet across his mission is far from over. She wants to share her knowledge in every village on a by, yang Traditional community centers on kiri bars are called man Yaiba the structures provide shade and protection Against strong winds and rain a Vienna is home to one of the largest manga bars in the region the environmental protection organization Kiri kan has invited representatives from several villages together. They're seeking ways to ensure potable water supplies So it is so important that we know that water is fresh water is clean And what is good for everyone so that we can all live long as a PK best people? Climate activists of our city is also working to combat the salinization of drinking water Dorian never but it burns Sometimes see water flows into my well and floods it all the dirt gets in we have no water to drink Our groundwater used to be fresh and clean we could drink it today it's salty and unpalatable to Wells near the sea are flooded quite Regularly and become spoiled by the salt if we were to wash with that water you'd feel like washing and sea water The salinity of water supplies isn't the only problem supplying clean drinking water is another challenge village representatives present their solutions We opted for this solar pump to make it work. We need equipment such as pipes to pump the well water to the houses We'll get the one about we thought about what would be the best solution for everyone that's why we chose a desalination plant We need a hand pump to supply ourselves with water You've suggested a number of ideas. It's important that the solution is cheap and will work for a long time We're going to lay out all of your criteria on the floor here Which solution will win? The village delegates are asked to vote That's an important part of the process says key Ricans Australian development aid worker Robert Kane We know this process isn't gonna lead us to a project It's really just getting people to think about The kinds of things the questions they should be asking when confronted with a new project all donors bringing a community There's not much export that comes out of view of us so there's no foreign income coming in which is difficult because Often you need the materials or the money and I think you someone need to break the dependency cycle Polynesia alofa founded the environmental protection organization kiri can Her goal is to support the people in kiri bus in their battle against climate change In Carabas most of the time the priority need for our people is water and that's why we got water into these communities The water is the priority we brought water tanks to collect or to harvest the rain Over the next few months every extended family will be supplied with their own water tank and solar panels to generate electricity part of a program funded by international aid People will be forced to live if we do not step in right now today to help them to adapt to stay That's what adaptation is all about for people to remain in their own homes in their own continued with their life and their culture I Wouldn't imagine my people living to another country. That is not this Because we have a very deep connection with our land but moving away to somewhere where you do not belong to you You will always become a second class person in your heart. You know that you don't belong there We're back on the main at all of Tarawa The Marine training center is a window of opportunity to a better life for many young Kira bars Up to 150 students trained here every year to become seafarers ship mechanics and cooks The drill at the training center strict as is the morning roll call 96 1197 24 not talking during the breakfast mess up so attached so what now I eat 45 F 39 long thickeners, but now the punishment here in the MTC desist scale So if a train is found today fingernails long fingernails Not wearing the younger chief told uniform I said for improper shame. That's to be punished. The change has to be punished for now The trainees have to rehearse a docking maneuver on the deck of a training ship today among them is 25 year old Tamara And the wrist and stream right so less than two plus one Seafarers from Puri Bass are in demand particularly on German vessels six shipping companies from Hamburg have offices on Tarawa supervised by Andrew Hines N' he holds the locals in high esteem and finds jobs for them on ships from all around the world Firstly the people who grow up on these islands have a strong connection to water They've been fishing and spending time on the water since childhood. They're strong in my experience It takes just one Kira bus to do a job that needs two Filipinos These 15 months are a process. They have to be on time be clean and well-dressed because they'll be confronted with a completely different world The trainees have to work hard for their dream all week long the demands are great Tamara only sees his wife and one-year-old daughter at the weekends He currently shares a dorm room with 19 other sailors Your this is my bed and that's my mattress made of palm leaves I Roll out the mattress every night. This is what it looks like. Yeah This is how I sleep Nagging them t0 I chose to train as a merchant marine because it gives me the chance to provide for my family It's my dream to continue my training after I finish this program The training center has a good reputation on kiri bus, but even this modern complex faces increasing bouts of flooding As you can see the entrance to the basin has become blocked by sonic rocky reefs and he's Built up here overnight because a small section of the seawall has broken Option it the water was a bit higher than usual and lacking or insufficient maintenance cost it to break That's a good food. I see Varga Voronezh the current deposited the sand here one had to hear off guitar People mess about with everything just like they do in Europe driving along this causeway You can see that the water exchange is restricted to just a small aperture all the water from the lagoon has to squeeze through Human interference with nature with disastrous consequences not least because it's changed ocean currents The causeway is a costly never-ending construction site The primary school in bond Ricky every morning begins with a prayer more than 90% of kiri buses population is Christian School is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14 Right now these are the three forces caused by global warming So, what does the future hold for Curie buses children it's a subject addressed in primary schools We want to alert the children to what's going on here and how they can deal with the problem most of the children are scared of climate change The children's fears differ from those of their teacher but They're all very concrete She's scared of the future, too We can emigrate to another country or confront the problem and live with it I always tell my students that we have to find ways of preventing soil erosion We have to build sea walls and plant mangroves we mustn't cut down our trees anymore The children have drawn pictures to illustrate what they think will happen as a result of global warming Our beaches will be washed away. This boy says we're using too much fuel In this girl's picture the land is submerged Everyone she says is swimming in the water because the ocean is washed away the land if sea levels continue to rise She says we'll all die These children are growing up with a palpable fear of the future This girl tells us her home was flooded just last week It happened while she was sleeping her mother woke her up and carried her out of the house This girl says she's very scared about climate change she believes many people are responsible for it But as a child, there's nothing she can do about it The village of baan, Ricci has become increasingly susceptible to flooding after heavy rainfall often the high water lasts for days Trainee Seafarer Tamara and his wife better our have bought a small house here We're going to live here in the future I'm currently living with my wife and my daughter with my parents, but we'll move in soon Once I've completed my training at the Marine Center, and I'm earning money by working on a ship I want to start raising my children here I Want to have a garden here, but I have to plow the soil first I want to build a fence and plant sweet potatoes and tapioca Maybe letters too As a crew member on a large container ship tomorrow we'll be able to earn up to 700 US dollars a month That will place him in kiri boss's middle class I'm very excited to be moving here. I'm so proud of him when he gets a job and starts earning money We'll be able to build something and have a bigger family if he didn't have a job We'd have a lot of problems. We wouldn't be able to lead this life. I'm very happy When night falls on Tarawa the fishermen sometimes recall a centuries-old fishing method Tear later and Matteo light a three-meter torch made of palm leaves on the beach at Tomiko The warm light of the fire lures small tasty reef fish into the shallow water It's not like it used to be when there were fewer people here Population growth has fueled an increase in fishing because of rising demand Many fishermen now use neon lights to attract fish It's rare that I writer and LaToya catch any fish with their traditional fishing method these days The one dog I've only caught her tomorrow It's hard to catch fish these days I feel the current has changed Tiger Antigone that in that day giving Mike my butt itchy The fishermen wonder whether climate change is to blame for that too The fisheries ministry are Cuba's Marine biologist our ante Takeo has been investigating the health of the coral reefs around Tarawa and the surrounding atolls for more than ten years Using measuring tapes he and his team regularly monitor coral growth and health What we're seeing is the more popular corals now are the ones that are detecting and more resilient to change Into increasing temperature, they're surviving more in the hot temperatures. They're spreading over which is okay in a sense that the corals aren't dying They're spreading there are lots of them But it's only it's like survival of the fittest The polyps that make up the stony corals are among the winners of climate change They seem to be particularly happy in the waters around kiri bass Because they're so resilient all that change That's why they're in really improving their Coral Cove is massive, even they could mean survivor you know storms and stuff like that a Hope for kiri bass but only healthy coral reefs can grow with the rising sea levels Their natural breakwaters and provide important protection for the islands during major storm surges Here in South that all wears in urban area there's a lot of factors affecting coral reefs construction infrastructure The main thing is it is rubbish since there's a very high population here in South tunnel which causes rubbish Yeah waste done to the coral reefs that's putting heavy pressure on As a result there are signs of degradation among weaker coral species in many reefs around Tarawa The population is set to double on Tarawa over the next 20 years climate coordinator Troy heating and the government of kiri bas face a huge challenge Unless we find a solution now to address this problem, you know If we were to top up the land here sand and you know kind of reclaim it, you know, that may be an option The government is even considered moving its people onto artificial floating islands futuristic visions and exorbitantly expensive designs by international architects Requires a period of Constant development and it's very hard to do with the lack of resources that we have science tells us the other timeline Something that we very hard to accept right now it may be that in just 50 years Kiri Bass will no longer exist. It could be the first country to be wiped off the map by climate change They're still very small window of hope I guess. Yeah pride is is is something that will keep you going Maybe the end not yet. 4k diversity is life. I Still will be a curious You""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,0,Inequality – how wealth becomes power (2/3) | DW Documentary (poverty richness documentary),"Christoph Gröner is one of the richest people in Germany. The son of two teachers, he has worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?Christoph Gröner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children's home. Christoph Gröner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. """"What we see here is total failure across the board,” he says. """"It starts with parents who just don’t get it and can’t do anything right. And then there’s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today."""" Chistoph Gröner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality? In Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany’s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. """"Land of Inequality"""" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children’s outlooks._______ Watch Part I Inequality - how wealth becomes power https://youtu.be/AFIxi7BiScIPart 3 Inequality - how wealth becomes powerhttps://youtu.be/wEufTD39xrwDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

co-organizer Christoph Cunha urges the wealthy guests at the auction to dig deep who wants to buy Leonel messes golden boot and with it the virtuous feeling of helping children [Music] we the people who drive things forward who have the possibilities the time the money we must get involved we have one of the best countries in the world with the best opportunities so let's help to create equal and fair opportunities for children thank you very much for six months Christophe Cunha let us record him on his day to day activities thanks to him and others the resulting film gives an insight into today's society in Germany at first glance Germany is a rich and powerful country full of opportunities but if you look closely even in this industrialized country the wealth is very unequally distributed success often depends on where you come from but why should it be that way do these great differences threaten social cohesion to get some answers we talked to some of the leading academics around the world who have specialized in the issue of inequality including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz today people says that the control of their nation is being stolen from inequality is the most pressing social problem facing us today welcome to the land of inequality [Music] Kleist off burner keeps getting richer benefits if you an app if you have 250 million euros you can throw it out the window and it'll come back through the door you can buy cars and real estate that increase in value you buy gold and the gold price goes up you can't destroy money through consumption Luna earns his money in real estate his company says he is behind every third new apartment in lighting alone we built or renovated everything you see he's worked hard to get at the top [Music] I always go to work if I have a herniated disk a 40-degree fever if my wife and I have a fight night on sleep I still work the next day finish better so does his success automatically rub off on his children can you actually buy life opportunities in Germany Berlin 6:00 a.m. while other fathers are waking their children up this millionaire is working up a sweat during an early morning workout [Music] Kona's everyday life is strictly regulated time is money and that can be added to anywhere even in the car where he turns the backseat into an office cloner sees his assistant anjali glazier almost every day but his four children usually only at the weekends as a father you naturally try to get the best for your children a child that attends a regular school still needs a lot from their parents during the week that's where I fail completely so what I've done with my children and it's probably more honest is to tell them I won't be around from Monday to Friday so I can't give them the attention they might need during that time they'll be under the best supervision somewhere else sending your children to a boarding school perhaps gives them a better chance of getting a good education then school children who live at home under kinder know no man should happen Christophe Cunha doesn't want his children to appear in this film two of them go to an elite boarding school in another city the school fees are three thousand euros a month per child three thousand euros per month few families have that much even to live on four thousand people live in these high-rise blocks known as the vices eat lung in Berlin's noid Cone district mostly large families in two to three room apartments sixty percent of them are on welfare children who grow up here usually go to the zonin Elementary School 93% of the children there do not have to pay for their books because their parents are poor these have been known as problems calls for years but no one has done anything about it a Jew in China and she would mom good morning everyone [Music] full Ausmus yeah what should you pay attention to when you write a caption for your holiday picture your hands a full stop after a sentence no exactly all but two children in garages Tamiya's fourth-grade class have foreign roots she sets them a written topic my best experience on holiday you can also write something about it first and then draw a picture sunders called me she said we should meet during the holidays I had a tournament we came for me and my parents went to etiquette supermarkets I got a Kinder Surprise and then we went back home [Music] this is my breakfast but you can have some too Stephanie Freitag is a teaching assistant she's there to help with tasks settle disputes and go on school trips when a teacher is off sick for a long time and we don't have enough staff then it makes me sad if the children don't have lessons they don't learn anything I can manage up to the fifth grade we're also doing something nice aren't we right well I like that those who speak little German at home need more support there are currently four vacancies for teachers at the school I want to become a civil engineer because I want to earn a lot of money because that's what my father does and you have to be good at math I want to graduate from high school I want to study I want to become a doctor because I like helping people just a quarter of the children here will make it to high school in the rest of Berlin it's almost twice as many they do have their big dreams and goals but they may not always know how to achieve them because they somehow don't know the way or it's sometimes closed off swooosh Manson's head teacher Karolina Pocomoke URI would like to hire more teachers but she only has a little more money to spend than she would have at a school where all the children spoke German and nobody was poor what the children need and hire the people to provide that then things would be completely different also the people who live here can't afford a lot and when we look at what the children need whether it's a healthy diet or more exercise or proper work materials which costs a lot of money ah forget there are so many factors that determine everyday life in class that you can't even describe it in words just man mid-war and ask a nice song Brian come on - Kenna Ave I know parents who don't send their children to this school at all they group together and send their children to a school farther away or they even ask the schools to open separate classes for their groups of children Jimmy this is all social segregation to me soon social segregation in this context is the spatial separation of rich and poor what happens when those on top and those down below drift further and further apart economists and social scientists all over the world are looking for answers and investigating the consequences of inequality one of them is Berlin based educational researcher Marcel hellbitch in a recent study he discovered that in Germany the rich and poor increasingly keep to themselves and hardly ever meet our study looked at 73 cities especially in terms of social segregation and we concluded that social segregation has actually increased in all but six or seven of them in states of Goethe's one example is Berlin unemployment and child poverty are decreasing in the north of Nikon and Coit Berg whereas almost two-thirds of the people in the vises eat lung tower blocks get help from the state [Music] in the horror area the a40 divides the city of Essen north of the motorway seventeen percent of adults are on social welfare whereas south of the a40 the figure is only seven percent in many cities in Germany we see these pockets in certain neighborhoods where 70 to 80 percent of the children live off benefits for the schools this means a concentration of the social problems that go with that the education system has to struggle with this every day Dom it immerses butum system you talk of snow your kin from not only our rich and poor meeting less and less it's also becoming increasingly likely that children with and without immigrant backgrounds will go to separate schools this is an experiment involving two schools in Essen in orange t-shirts an elementary school in the far more affluent southern part of the city and in blue t-shirts children from a school in the poorer north of Essen the children have to ask each other a single question the pupils from Essen north ask each other are you a foreigner [Music] studies show that children growing up amongst many poor people or immigrants will most probably underachieve Makonnen does extreme we can precisely tell which children will have which chances we can work out the probabilities and I would know exactly where to send a social education worker or a good teacher if I had one so in particular when you look at children who move or who were randomly offered a chance to move to a better neighborhood through an affordable housing program they end up doing far better than the children who didn't have that opportunity showing directly that this can't just be about differences in ability or about genes Germany aims to provide education that doesn't depend on parents wealth the state uses taxpayers money to ensure that all children go to good daycare centers and good schools it also offers opportunities to those who have few but what if the state doesn't stick to that [Music] Kristof greener a millionaire and father feels he has a duty from a good home and the education policy is substandard your parents can help with that I think you have a bad home but a good school then the school can lessen the impact of the bad home but it's failed everywhere we've got parents who don't care and don't get their act together have an education policy with the doors wide open to the chaos we see today the entrepreneur is on his way to the Laughing hearts foundation for disadvantaged children it supports around 2,000 children in 22 care homes Ghana wants to see what's become of the money they donated and to initiate new projects here for example everything was full of concrete so we had the concrete ripped out and created a place where children like to spend time and don't hit their heads on the hard surfaces Kona takes one project at a time paying for tutoring dental braces and sports fields and all of it in addition to running his business could see you can do charitable work and get your homework done a small amphitheater will be built here for me it'll be a dream come true sometimes you feel like sitting on the floor and just playing you have to be careful in the job I do you can't just sit there and play because you know you're our real heroes thank you isten who needs the most time financial resources and support from children you can't save a poor old person although you can't alleviate the circumstances they live in but with a young person or a child you can still set the course in a sponsored this sports film for 100,000 euros many children here are under the guardianship of the youth welfare office and can't be filmed so it's fun to play here it's working out it's fun the girls from the children's home have rehearsed a dance for the event as a thank-you could I just have everyone's attention for a second I want to tell you some important information this field is here we created it because we believe in you children and we'll do everything in our power to make your play time as much fun as other children's play time we believe in you and we'll always be here to do these kinds of things if it becomes clear in a society that the richer people have much better opportunities than the poorer it also affects those in between the middle classes if they can no longer rely on the state to offer opportunities to all children no matter where their school or nursery is it has far-reaching consequences then the pressure grows to do the best possible for the children in Germany a family with two children is middle-class if they have a gross monthly income of between three and five thousand euros like the class family from Leipzig thomas klaus picks up his children Gustav and Louisa from the nursery a big topic at the moment is which school Gustav should go to we would like you and your child to join us for preschool in the periods from December to February we're offering your child a weekly preschool lesson so we can start school really start that's cool isn't it the school you're coming to you can also come with us it says only your child but you are our child too the children can grow up in comfort thanks to Thomas's job the engineer works only five minutes bike ride away from home they can afford an apartment in a good location but it's been clear for some months now that his company wants to save money and that entire plants are under threat possibly his as well so there we are we all thought we were part of the big operation and then some lawyer tells us we aren't I see a huge risk that we'll be left standing here empty-handed then we'll have lost if we're just ripped out of here without any control over it then we're really facing total defeat here in live scene as chairman of the Leipzig plants works Council Thomas Klaus travels to the Siemens headquarters in Munich where the managers want to announce their savings plans it's an end to the rumors everything in black and white I have two children and I also have plans for the future and they are largely based on a future with my good job at Siemens and now it's all up in the air when that future is no longer there then I'm on shaky ground it's a bit like the road to the slaughterhouse should be very emotional where does the middle-class fear of sliding down the social ladder come from for a long time the German middle class always believed that their prosperity would only increase but all that is about to change and it has something to do with global development economists Branko Milanovic has examined the consequences of globalization and number crunched large amounts of data on it his conclusion people's income has risen but not uniformly when we look at globalization and we are when we say about globalization we are really talking about the period of the last 25 to 30 years and we have two large groups of people who you can say are the winners of globalization the first group already belonged to the rich 1% of the world and they are getting richer and richer a particular interest are the middle classes in Asia especially in India and China where the income of 2 billion people has grown strongly they are the winners of globalization unlike the lower middle classes of the US and the industrialized countries of Europe income is also stagnating in Germany the group that you can say are losers although they have not really lost in real terms but certainly they have not gained very much from globalization are people from the lower parts of the income distributions in the rich countries so it's actually lower middle class of Germany United States Japan or France and they have incomes today that they had like 20 years ago bahama ski shafts we've managed to pull 2 billion people in India and China out of poverty house this is an incredibly positive development hopefully she pulls it right at the same time it's true that the lower middle classes whether in Mannheim or Michigan haven't got a lot out of it in the last 20 years new personas feel a perfect tightness in Spanish our second clip Marcy in concrete terms it means that if Europe fails to link globalization with principles of social justice there is a long-term risk of a rupture between globalization and the lower strata of the population Angelica's papa back in Munich Thomas Klaus knows now for sure that his plant is slated for closure if the management gets its way parts of the business will probably also be relocated to areas where production is a lot cheaper you got the sin off no matter how long this situation lasts there will come a time when I won't be working a kilometer away from our apartment when I won't have the income and security I have now and then I'll have to take a look at what I'll be able to afford I'll also be back on the job market and that won't be easy I'm well aware of that and there will be considerable upheavals for example this from you choose the family budget will no longer cover the flat we have now you the housing market in Leipzig is very competitive as in all German metropolitan regions people are moving to the city centre here real estate investors smell high returns rents have risen by 25% in the last five years the Ford of all three to four room apartments are rare if they have to move thomas classes family would probably have to relocate to the cheaper edge of town that makes them what price Construction done here is in the luxury segment it's like everywhere isn't it you know the situation in the big cities and I think we're on exactly the same sort of spiral here truly of course that would be attractive but given our current situation I need to give that much thought Christoph una is also building rental apartments here he says they are affordable to rooms for 700 euros excluding services that's 12 euros a square metre it's not the most expensive it's not the classiest but it says something it has style quality meaning of soul I'm very proud of it because I'd like to live here myself we want to become the VW of real estate so we need to step on the gas kalenna success also impresses his children they get asked about him at school in Milan Gandhi classic Omaha classmates say things like guna is that the one from the cg group and you drive up in front of the playground and they're watching and then Google CG group and say do you know what your father does suddenly my son comes home and says daddy is this what you do that's the kind of thing that gives you a little bit of pleasure all of a sudden he's interested and it's a mixture of Pride respect and a bit of sadness because I also know that the time I spent here is sometimes at the expense of the family opinion munch munch last indefinite [Music] anayia corner works in the basement of the old Berlin postal bank building which crona's company is currently renovating she doesn't want to just live off her husband her furnishing company fits out apartments including ones built by her husband the cleaners want to shield their children from their luxurious lifestyle as much as they can [Applause] this thing vomits oh that's why we decided to send them to boarding school there among their peers there and they don't get what's going on at home every day life is nice they don't have to see the events we go to how we go out or what we look like when we dress up for a ball or something can buy it what is chic man in tonight gift is hard to be good at boarding school there are rules and all the children are treated the same here in Berlin not all the children are the same there are children who have rich parents or poor parents fuchsbau Noland and there's a lot of tension among the children about what they have that the others don't Anthony hat I picked up my middle daughter from confirmation class and suddenly she hid in the front foot well my first ictus when I asked her what she was doing she said the other children can't see me sitting in this car those are the problems they have to deal with this and then do a local problem it didn't have good Museum at Clackamas Kapila z20 on movies haha there are a lot of situations where they have it easier but there are also situations where they have to compromise because they have used their a lot it's important to Thomas and Katherine Klaus that they and their children can stay exactly where they are there's a very good social environment here there aren't the typical rogues here where you think does that child even have a chance at all the home the parental and social environment all exert a strong influence and I get to see my friends from kindergarten back in school I'm not the same boy his friends will go to the same school as him and he knows where it is he's already thinking about who will be in his class we have to do everything to keep it this way the more uncertain the future the more important the children's opportunities become when the middle class is fear for their jobs they also fear relegation at Stanford University the downward trend has already been confirmed by figures economists Raj Chetty has evaluated how income has changed over generations he describes a trend that is discernible not only in the US but also in Germany 92% of children born in 1940 earn more than their parents did but then if you look at how that's evolved over time you see a pattern that has come to be known as the fading American dream where that steadily Falls over time such that if you look at kids who are turning 30 today kids born in the middle of the 1980s only 50% of them are earning more than their parents did and particularly they're going to likely to be the losers of globalization if they don't have high levels of education because one of the benefits of a higher level of education it makes individuals more flexible more able to move from one job to another because education is maybe not the only means but it's certainly the primary means by which people can improve their own lot in life and pursue those goals that they have [Music] the promise that the next generation will be better off has always been part of the German identity the modest Central European variant of the American dream but if that promise is broken it has consequences parents will try to maximize their own children's opportunities in life the struggle for status begins with the choice of elementary school [Music] Marcus Costel is a nurse at a hospital in Borkum he has a five-year-old son Luis who he doesn't want on camera Luis will be going to school in autumn Castel is afraid that his son will not receive proper support at a public school so he has registered him at a private school a Waldorf School at the moment he is so far ahead that he can already read and write and so on but the public schools would probably concentrate on the worst in the class first the downtime he'd have in school was a decisive factor for me as well as the different social environment she would be in Causton himself went to a public school run down buildings and big classes with a teacher standing at the front he wants to spare his son that but it doesn't come cheap there's a monthly contribution deducted as a percentage of your salary the highest contribution is five hundred and fifty euros a month and then there's a building fee that's three thousand two hundred euros for the entire school duration and then there are the costs for lunch and supervision multiple times cost which is energy between systems the shite district in boham more than one in five inhabitants here have a migration background and vodka site is home to most of the city's unemployed people right in the middle of it is the Veda Shula Marcos Castel has registered his son here it's a Waldorf School which are private alternative schools like most schools religious or secular they are largely financed with tax money because all children can go here at least in theory kirsten frikar is a teacher there she guides interested parents through the campus here's a classic you're doing great I'll come back again at the end of the year and see how they've turned out there is one teacher here for every ten children there are only 34 pupils in each year in the neighboring public school there are twice as many most of the time the children are divided into two classes that's great Bayla now you can start with the file reduce Mimi and mocha this is of course the attraction for all the students a real highlight the idea is to give our city kids an experience of what nature is and where does our breakfast egg come from not from the supermarket there's a school garden a school circus a theatre stage a sculptors workshop a canteen and music claps his instruments are important for their early musical education you want everyone to experience the success of creating sound [Music] I'm talking the proportion of migrant children children with a migrant background is relatively low here's that's something we don't like at all but it's obviously because they think it's a private school we can't afford it we have two groups who come here one is a big Turkish family it's like a clan that's branched out more and more and so we get the cousins of the cousins who have already been here it's like that I'm very cozy in the cuisine the cuisine man it's all about word-of-mouth I do the second our children here with an African parent these are the two migratory backgrounds that we have children from here although there are only two or three children for class not more not yet two randomly selected school classes one from a Waldorf School in Hana in purple t-shirts and one from a comprehensive school in Cologne skulk district in white the question to everyone do you speak another language at home other than German and do you sometimes help your parents to translate into German [Applause] on segregation is just getting worse the woody tied up both the total number of private schools and the number of private elementary schools have gone up a lot recently in fact the number of private students has increased by 30 percent in the last 20 years the increase has been especially noticeable in elementary schools here the number of private schools has quadrupled that's because you have parents willing to pay for it and do nothing to counter it also there are schools that need these high school fees or think they need them to provide a good education and most importantly we have an administration that neither has the situation under control nor wants to control it on average the state covers two-thirds of the costs of private schools most of the rest is paid by the parents this is how the public school administration saves money researchers estimate it could be as much as 2.4 billion euros a year since these private schools are replacing public schools the state has to ensure they're affordable Germany's Basic Law states that private alternative schools may only exist if everyone can afford them ahoy ticker stranded niche minimum cos it's the current state of affairs is not compatible with the basic law and the main problem here is that the German states which should be monitoring the basic law do next to nothing to put a stop to these discrepancies these Waldorf schools as well as other independently sponsored schools boast that they are good schools and many of them are they have an educational principle that's successful so why don't they take it over into the public school system that's what I'm wondering what this team does is the poverty seek media by start the state is supposed to ensure that good opportunities for children to not depend on their parents money because that often doesn't happen others take on part of the responsibility such as the patrons of the laughing hearts Foundation charity gala in Berlin where Christoph Cunha is also the evenings host [Music] I slept for four hours but I have enough energy for 10 days there's a lot at stake today we have to collect money for the children were really motivated but few children in care have been invited instead the rich and glamorous the Berlin senator for health care and equality is here it's nice to see all you beautiful people and you're doing something good thank you so much for that Dilek coal at is called the patroness here she doesn't have a say in what happens with the donation money but at least she has Lerner on her side they're both committed to saving children from going down dangerous paths in life the girls end up on the street that's how far it goes it tears my heart apart that cannot happen be a girl uka known from a children's talent show sings for the crowds [Music] [Applause] it's an event supported by the taxpayer yes Agustina vav- donations are tax-deductible so in the end the state pays half and we pay the other half and I have to sign the [Music] I have to do a little Heidi Klum here from Germany's Next Topmodel girl we have to do something with your outfits because you sang about a present we would like to make you a present for tonight an evening dress [Applause] I absolutely don't think we should be orienting ourselves around the slower and weaker members of society what I am quite sure of is that will be judged by how we the strong performers deal with the fact that there are lower performers and people who struggle in society like children or people who have fallen into poverty that's how we'll be judged what does someone who can afford anything do who doesn't want more money but more influence does wealth also help in political participation possibly even more than is good for democracy the Siemens employees in Leipzig are making photo greetings cards for their managers they'll see that their decisions affect people right now we feel powerless meanwhile Christoph Cunha is still fighting to stay globally competitive and for that dear investors I'll also need your support in the future so who really has the power they have the power""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,0,Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,"Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Documentary,StjIv33zJ9c,"[""decades on the topic of North Korea remains a touchy subject the world has passed judgment the country is beyond repair our preconceived ideas about the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea remain firmly in place an erratic or Willian regime paranoid schizophrenic a place of modern-day gulags a red dynasty long headed by a despotic film buff and now by his son whose portly appearance is topped with a singular haircut and then there's the country's nuclear arsenal a threat that makes the self-proclaimed innocent nations of the world tremble with fear when it comes to North Korea why do we so often resort to cliches in light of the difficult and often tragic situation the country's people find themselves in hyperbole seems rather inappropriate [Music] we're often told that foreigners are not permitted into the country that those who do manage to visit are not permitted to see much of anything and that those who do manage to see something should remember it's probably think [Music] someone once insisted to us that there were no high-rises in Pyongyang a disorienting claim given that one of us was living on the 24th floor of a building on Quine bak Street at the time [Music] this film was shot over a period of eight years by three people one of us is a translator of Korean between us we made more than 40 trips to North Korea but the film does not show prison camps or rocket launch pads that's forbidden as are images of soldiers construction sites shopping malls gambling pictures of people who do not have enough to eat and pictures of people who are eating avoiding these images is harder than it might seem [Music] [Applause] entering North Korea is still complicated but foreigners are permitted to travel and explore the country although they always have a local minder visitors are not required to proclaim their loyalty to the state nor do they only see what the state permits them to see and it's a myth that you'll never hear laughter in North Korea [Music] as soon as we leave the city the roads are riddled with cracks and potholes the bumpy journey is hard on drivers and vehicles that could explain why broken-down trucks and buses are a common sight [Music] depending on the season the workers in the fields might be harvesting wheat rice or potatoes although much of the country is mountainous the rest is primarily devoted to farming North Korea hopes to become economically self-sufficient someday every square metre of available land is put to use even on the steep hillsides but only barely 20% of the land is arable this factory was not filmed in 1920 but in 2016 using a small camera while exploring the city of Hama hung as so often in North Korea appearances are deceiving this is the country's largest fertilizer factory which Kim il-sung honored with more than 30 visits it's recently been modernised in a bid to increase the productivity of the country's cooperative farms [Laughter] cooperative farms like this one with its familiar oxcarts geese and ducks and the omnipresent red flags another visit to a collective farm a year later it's raining and everyone has gone to seek shelter the productivity chart proudly displays the farms yields we take shelter in the living room of one of the farm workers she tells us about the bitter cold winters hot summers and the fact breaking work in the rice fields her son is 14 small for his age she admits but the family has been through hard times her son was born just as the Great Famine was ending behind her one of the country's ubiquitous historical melodramas is playing on TV [Music] then she launches into a vivid description of her visits to Pyongyang in addition to the mausoleum of the great leaders I visited the Museum of the revolution the amusement park near the leaders birthplace the revolutionary martyrs cemetery the Science and Technology Museum and the grand people's study house I went everywhere [Music] anyone from the provinces who visits the capital comes here first the house where Kim il-sung was born the birthplace of the Republic this is where it all started they say the great leaders training as a revolutionary the resistance against the Japanese the struggle against the evil landowners and collaborators it's a story that's very familiar to people here and as Kim il-sung was the son of an ordinary peasant he's also venerated as a role model this is a place of pilgrimage year round in the winter the buildings and grounds are decked and sober white during our visit in 2011 we first saw local visitors wearing brightly colored winter coats imported from China by 2015 the classes of school children are wearing brand-name sweatpants even though their sneakers don't quite yet make the grade [Music] September brings the color of autumn and a pumpkin on the thatched roof in Pyongyang everything is bigger more modern more beautiful we were told by the woman from the collective farm the city has more of everything more light more shops more food more housing more work more education more culture who wouldn't want to live here the capital is more than the epicentre of the state it's an icon our farmer would probably have been told that these exemplary buildings are home to exemplary citizens scientists soldiers civil servants some of the most eminent live on the glossy New Marais or future scientists Street for a farmer from a village without so much as a paved road this would be an impressive sight [Music] and the people who live here seem to have plenty of time for leisure activities [Music] our visitor from the collective farm couldn't help but be dazzled by these high-rises the most famous of which looks like an atom when viewed from above and by the new district springing up around the city built with the labor of the country's soldiers and workers [Music] but it would be very unlikely that our visitor would ever set foot in one of these apartments reserved for the most worthy citizens it's perfectly neat and tidy though the residents have fled the camera there's a computer cell phone books and a sewing machine the balcony offers a view across the city in the midst of a real estate boom there's an abundance of color quite the contrast to the gray that dominated here just 20 years ago this real estate boom has given rise to a black market in Pyongyang in other large cities when the state Awards a faithful follower with a new apartment they pass on the old one to the highest bidder for a choice location prices can easily top $100,000 and only a fraction of that is taxed that ends up in state coffers Karl Marx might have called this the primitive accumulation of capital a visitor's tour might end with a trip to an amusement park or a waterpark one of kim jong un's priorities is building playgrounds for the people the entrance fee equivalent of two euros isn't cheap by local standards but everyone mingles and enjoys themselves even the adults get into the swing of things [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I came with my group but I don't know where my coworkers are now I'm looking for them [Music] I work at a large coal mine an hour away from Pyongyang I can't come often because of my work today we visited the great leaders mausoleum so I stopped by here I like to come to Pyongyang to relax after having fun like this work comes more easily what are you looking at go play we've never been abroad but now we have lots of water parks even at home in our province north of Pyongyang we will become the best in the world without anyone's help just by our own hands any more questions we're the best [Applause] some of the rural visitors seem a bit lost in the crowd but since many people don't know how to swim no one really notices but on state television nowadays people can even tune into swimming lessons the Sun is beginning to set a good time to visit the city's main amusement park beyond Pyongyang's Arch of Triumph like everywhere in North Korea filming anything to do with the military is banned but hard to avoid because soldiers are everywhere [Applause] some might call this nothing but bread and circuses but it's far more than that there's hardly a North Korean who doesn't dream of living in Pyongyang and every resident of Pyongyang is terrified of being expelled from the city for some foolish mistake forcing them and their family to live in exile for a few years or for the rest of their lives and a place where they'll have less of everything [Music] with its lights and sights Pyongyang inspires loyalty people flocked to the parks and swimming pools to enjoy what is the most attractive city in the country and even the world for the people who live here at least since their world ends at the North Korean border [Music] we've never witnessed a birth in North Korea but we've seen plenty of weddings for wedding preparations to be more precise like this professional photo shoot where the happy couple is posing in front of Pyongyang's most iconic locations it's monsoon season which means 38 degrees Celsius and very humid [Music] the bride and groom first went to the statues of the great leaders then we came to the flower park you see here near the water fountains soldiers usually like to pose in front of military monuments like the monument to the victorious fatherland liberation war what the wedding video doesn't show are the many people who helped make this happy event possible in North Korea most marriages are arranged through matchmakers it's their job to find the ideal marriage partner who will also be suitable to the families although marrying for love is just starting to trend arranged marriages are still the norm one result is that people usually marry within their own social class for many decades the country's elite was dominated by the revolutionary comrades of Kim il-sung and their descendants at the bottom of the social order were the families of people who had collaborated with Japan and their descendants in between were some 40 subclasses who were not permitted to marry outside their rank the end of Kim il-sung's regime the famine under Kim jong-il and the partial disintegration of both state and party that followed not only shook the country but also its traditional social hierarchy this helped loosen the stringent marriage rules today the most desirable professions for a husband are scientist diplomat the military and of course business professionals [Music] for years women traffic police were highly sought after on the marriage market but they're seen less often now with the installation of traffic lights [Music] young couples are expected to have children and their education will be put in the hands of the state at an early age the country boasts a reported literacy rate of one hundred percent a success that is attributed to the revolution the most important school subjects are math physics music and singing Korean and the lives of the great leaders from kindergarten on children are subjected to a rigorous selection process the best students spend their holidays taking part in sports at the young pioneer camps when we arrived at the stadium the competition is underway each side is cheering on its team the young charges aren't wearing the standard lapel pins bearing the images of the great leaders they're on holiday and children under 16 aren't obliged to wear them [Applause] then it's time for the tug of war the evil American soldier in the middle is tough he's already made it through several tournaments [Laughter] [Applause] finding a good husband having a successful career these topics are far more interesting to most North Koreans than the endless propaganda they're exposed to getting married is important and it's also the focus of the sitcoms that are broadcast on a giant screen near the central railway station locals stand here to watch them in the middle of December even in a chilly minus 15 degrees Celsius there's also an ad for automaker peon wah which means peace and Korean the company was founded by Sun Myung Moon s unification Church but has been fully owned by the state since 2013 [Music] the sitcoms portray a politically correct world the individual matters only as a part of the collective we're being a good worker is what counts [Music] in the winter everyone is responsible for a stretch of road no matter how much snow has fallen it has to be cleared that's why scenes of people scraping snow and ice off their patch of road before heading off to the office are a common sight in the winter [Music] for some unknown reason we had to wait for years before our guides allowed us to film in parks [Music] Moron bong park is a popular place for Sunday outings it's something like North Korea's Central Park we wondered why permission to film here took so long people drawing Park scenes hardly seem like a state secret then there are also shooting ranges dancers and lots of picnics on public holidays the state sometimes distributes meat and beer [Music] these pensioners free of family and professional obligations are enjoying a day out [Music] they're free style of dancing is not easily defined and has the air of a shamanic ritual [Applause] in 1956 filmmaker Chris Marker who was part of the first French delegation to visit the north after the Korean War recorded almost identical scenes of workers dancing by a train Factory [Music] we've always danced it more in Bangkok we come here with former colleagues we meet every Sunday to dance thank you why don't you stay and dance with us the district next to the park is nicknamed little Dubai at first sight it looks like a kind of commuter suburb but appearances are deceiving all sorts of things are hidden behind these tinted windows electronics stores pharmacies banquet halls supermarkets and a huge selection of bars and restaurants [Music] this television ad sings the praises of a luxury supermarket so heavily air-conditioned the staff wear warm jackets it's well stocked with everything from Swiss chocolate to olive oil French and Italian wines and imported fruit the elegant restaurants upstairs are popular with the dongju the money masters as the newly affluent are called they serve up sushi cappuccino a $20 steak North Korea is no longer an anti-consumerist state quite the opposite for those who can afford it North Korea's party newspapers don't publish restaurant reviews yet but given the number of restaurants barbecue joints and snack bars cropping up everywhere around the country that's probably not too far off is the North Korean obsession with food a remnant of the arduous March the famine that ravaged the country between 1994 to 2000 causing somewhere between half a million and a million deaths back then even the word restaurant was considered taboo when Kim jong-un came into power he promised the North Koreans they would never face such deprivation again now food has become a sign of success an important part of the culture almost as much as in South Korea [Music] we come across a 20-18 press release from the official North Korean news agency it reads from the 2nd to the 4th of April the 23rd cooking festival took place at the Pyongyang noodle house marking the day of the Sun the birthday of President Kim il-sung [Music] if there's anything North Koreans excel at its parades each time military experts around the world scrutinized the missiles mounted on the vehicles imported in violation of UN sanctions others analyzed the slogans or ponder the differences between parades over three generations of rulers Kim Mills son his son and his grandson but there's one constant over the years the images of North Koreans cheering on their leaders [Applause] [Music] it takes weeks of practice to make these living mosaics [Applause] normally filming rehearsals is forbidden North Korea only likes to display finished products to be an acquire a painting missile or a reform but it's a tempting scene since 5:30 in the morning students have been out on every square in the city practicing for the upcoming parade all of Pyongyang's main roads pass through Kim il-sung's square it's obligatory to slow down when passing in front of the portraits of the great leaders so the temptation to reach for our cell phones and cameras is high [Music] we observe the portraits as they observe us during our first visits here we were like many foreigners and tricked by their omnipresence but the more often we visited the less we noticed them the same does not apply to North Koreans cyclists are required to dismount from their bikes and look upon the statues of their leaders cars must slow down passers-by turn to gaze at the images [Music] shortly after Kim Jong Il's death a young upper-class woman tried to explain what the leaders meant to her it's a bit like you with your Jesus she said except for us Jesus would also be a member of the family [Applause] in the heat of the summer we occasionally saw a fan cooling the portrait of the leaders north korean art like this fresco near the entrance to a sports shoe factory is designed to portray the country as the party would like to see it it's not pure fiction but more often more an aspiration rather than a reality the real one factory or weeping willow paradise has 700 workers 70% are women they produce 1.5 million sports shoes a year it's assembly line work for years local products were conspicuous in their conformity now the factory is seeking to draw inspiration from foreign trends in marketing jargon this is what's called benchmarking so after he visited our factory our respected marshal sent us one hundred forty two pairs of foreign shoe models back home dummies and I listened by the demeanor he told us to display them at the workplace next to the ones which had been done incorrectly that allows technicians and employees to observe and compare them to ours our goal is to raise the quality of our shoes to an international level copying foreign trends reducing imports and promoting local industry makes sense in a country that is often struck by sanctions but for the plan to work the products have to appeal to North Korean consumers one new brand is called body bas with a be the shoes all sport three stripes in North Korea patriotism is still a key sales driver fashions are changing slowly too in the early 1990s a foreign ministry publication was still proudly defending the goal of a monochrome society something between grey and brown times have changed [Music] [Music] we pay a visit to a bowling alley bowling popular in the 1980s has become trendy again [Music] [Applause] upstairs people are playing the slot machines downstairs we get a good look at some of the latest fashions here two banners tout the party line it reads let's advance the social revolution that ensures the happiness and well-being of the masses if it wasn't for the slogans on the walls we could be almost anywhere in Asia [Music] this young woman is an office worker everyone dresses to suit their body type and coloring some women have square shoulders and try to disguise them the heavier ones try to dress on the color that suits them and then do the same don't they everyone knows best which clothes shoes and makeup to choose so they can look stylish have fun we come here with friends and colleagues to get some exercise and relax Bowling Alone is no fun it's the atmosphere and good mood that counts [Music] at this rest area along the motorway a bus full of Chinese tourists has stopped on its way to Kaesong the city at the border to South Korea in 2017 these visitors had all but disappeared to distinction in 2018 they returned nearly 1,000 Chinese tourists come each day drawn by the peace and quiet the unspoiled nature and perhaps a touch of nostalgia for a country that reminds them of China 40 years ago though it might come as a surprise training for jobs in the tourism industry is very popular in North Korea nowadays over the long term the country is hoping to increase the number of visitors by 30 percent each year in the fall once on beach on the East Sea is deserted it's the offseason here two soldiers have the beach to themselves this time were allowed to film them since they're not in uniform this is the same beach in the summer [Music] on the right the premium beach for affluent visitors on the left the public area where admission costs just a few cents whether it's a group of workers a gathering of students or entire families everyone's enjoying themselves [Music] people arrived by truck or on bicycles some come for the day others for a week many come from rural regions [Music] okay everybody dig in we come from the countryside north of Pyongyang the whole family is come here to relax it's the best place to rest and have fun our leader Kim Jong long encouraged us to come there building another tourist site in one Sun and this year we're enjoying the beach here next year we plan to relax at the new kata my tourists own in the distance we can see the construction site dozens of hotels are being built that's another priority for the current leader when Donald Trump met with Kim jong-un the US president was enthusiastic about the area and said the location had a lot of potential for development in 2015 and 2016 North Korean delegations discreetly inspected the French Riviera and other Mediterranean resorts for ideas that they could bring back to adopt at home [Music] the manager of a famous local fish restaurant is pleased with what's happening [Music] it's a great opportunity to make one sound known around the world there are lots of guest houses and small hotels some people even come here because the sea is very close I hope many French people will come here to swim and try our famous soup of course except in the mining in nuclear testing areas there's lots of unspoiled nature here due to embargoes farming uses very little artificial fertilizer there's little light pollution due to frequent electricity shortages it comes as something of a surprise that North Korea has never thought to market itself as a pioneer in sustainable development uninhabited for the past 65 years the Demilitarized Zone has preserved a unique biodiversity [Music] so far pyongyang doesn't seem inclined to take advantage of these natural assets [Music] in the rest of the world North Korea is seen as an anomaly North Korea also sees itself as unique which it certainly is as frequent visitors we are struck by the endless repetition of the same songs sung everywhere at schools and on public transportation the same slogans decorate the streets the same films are constantly broadcast on TV North Korea is a country under a bell jar a country marching to its own pace it's impenetrable frustrating exhausting but its people are open curious and full of life North Korea is changing rapidly Poli Poli or fast fast as a favorite phrase in both North and South Korea North Koreans tastes are changing as are their hopes for the future perhaps one day our image of North Korea will change too [Music] [Music] you

63,0,How poor people survive in the USA | DW Documentary,"Homelessness, hunger and shame: poverty is rampant in the richest country in the world. Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

coffee before going to work this kind of wood bulletproof coffee is very famous in the United States [Music] Maria's fall from grace is a situation that affects thousands of other Americans for a long time she had everything she always wanted she was married and lived in this beautiful house but after five years of living together her blissful marriage suddenly fell apart he kind of dumped me dumped me it's okay it didn't work bye bye okay bye bye see you later I said well no I don't have please go home I'm a homeless no bad no no furniture no house so it's just my car I have a seat here and yeah that's the way it is Maria preferred to leave everything to her ex-husband and turn over a new leaf but over the last several years in California the cost of rent has risen so much that her salary the equivalent of 1,500 euros was not enough for her to afford an apartment Maria's just one of many middle-class Americans who have in recent years fallen into poverty [Applause] officially America is great again since the 2008 crisis the economy has never been stronger with record-breaking growth and unemployment has dropped to a historical low less than four percent an upturn for which Donald Trump has claimed all the credit there has never been a better time to start living the American dream but despite what the president claims the famous American dream is far from being achieved 40 million people are living below the poverty line and millions of workers will go to great lengths to stay above it becoming homeless overnight is what these Americans fear most because here the system is not very kind to those short of cash then I catch up real quick or Europe can have a judgement of possession against you and get addicted in some states being laced on your rent is no laughing matter one by one tenants are evicted at gunpoint for these Americans on the verge of ruin seeking medical treatment can cost a fortune and take your medicine too because you may not get one or the other so some people are standing up in solidarity making sure they're taking care of free of charge in field hospitals not unlike those found in a country at war an insight into the lives of those who cannot scrape a living in the heart of destitute America [Music] San Diego in Southern California 300 days of sunshine a year and beaches as far as the eye can see this is picture-postcard California San Diego is also one of the most dynamic cities in the country here unemployment is practically non-existent this dream lifestyle was once an everyday reality for Eric he was a successful computer engineer earning 7,000 euros a month today at 53 years old this man lives alone in his car and in order to eat for free he has made an arrangement with the staff at a pizzeria hello how are you today yep thank you what do you take here that these are the slices that they have in their display that they haven't for too long then they put them in the fridge for me so that they donate them [Music] era comes every evening to pick up some leftover pizza well thank you very much very much appreciate it okay bye-bye he's going to share these unsold slices with other victims of poverty because for a year and a half Eric has been sleeping in this parking lot the one way Maria the cleaner also lives his pizza deliveries make his neighbors very happy like lorella a 55 year old obit driver no no no I had a drive all day today [Music] in his former life Eric also worked a lot 50 hours a week but four years ago he suffered a burn out and also problems with his heart he could not work and received unemployment benefits for six months and then nothing at all going burning through my savings I ended up basically burning through everything and what couldn't afford to stay in a farm in a larger job eric is trying to pick himself up nowadays is doing temporary work and is saving up to be able to rent an apartment after her long day at work Maria's back yeah it's a where I work is a little hard because I have to lift a lady she's very heavy back and forth back and forth but nine hours is new it's a lot of hours but I'm okay first eat my food my bed I'm ready to jump in my bed at half past 9:00 at night the gates closed from this point onward no more cars can enter the parking lot at night there isn't a security guard they haven't been any attacks here to date but Maria doesn't take any chances I close the door put the windows down like this much and put the alarm somebody's trying to break in I will know I got my pepper spray and my hand my cutter somebody's trying to break in Shh spray yeah because you never know a few meters away Erik is getting ready to spend another night in his car even though it's full to the brim the former computer engineer will sleep sitting behind the wheel it's a world away from the comforts of his old life one thing that I've really found out about this is that you know the typical stereotype of you know the homeless person being lazy and not wanting to work or being a drug addict that may be the case in some places and some and some but the people have come true in this program most of them are very hard-working people that want to get ahead that and either have some some health issues or have some had a streak of bad luck or for whatever reason they've you know come into this this this situation some people are able to get out of it quickly some people it takes longer California is a state of stark contrasts despite being the fifth largest economy in the world a growing number of its workers can no longer afford a place to live but there is another state where the system is even more and forgiving that state is Virginia right next to Washington DC it's capital Richmond is a former industrial city here a quarter of the population live beneath the poverty threshold of the ten major cities with the highest rates of eviction in the country half are located in Virginia in Richmond alone around 3,000 tenants are forced out of their homes every year the evictions are a routine job for officer loyal from the sheriff's office several times a week he distributes the dreaded yellow notices in the state of Virginia the law is strict if the rent is laid by five days the landlord has the right to begin the eviction process the threatened tenants have one week to settle their debts otherwise they face eviction by force and officer loyal does not show much sympathy this morning he and his colleagues have to evict the residents of this house and just like when arresting a dangerous criminal they enter the home with their guns drawn the tenant is not currently at home and clearly they have not had time to vacate the premises as well the landlord he immediately reclaims his property to make sure the house is secure the tenant has arrived and is in shock she had been renting the house was seven years a single mother to a grown-up daughter she works but as frequently struggled to make ends meet she has to pick up her belongings the next day otherwise everything will go to the junkyard at her expense it's just gonna be easy on you like the vehicle to send a backyard or whatever if you haven't removed because if he has a tow company remove it and that's an added expense that you'd be looking at do you think all this is a bit harsh do I think it's harsh now you got to do we gotta do it I gotta do what I gotta do what are you gonna do where am I gonna sleep deep in the whole thing about needs yeah I can yeah have a good day she's immediately rendered homeless no room for negotiation this is the only way that's up to her if that's the only way she said she would move before this didn't move maybe she had nowhere to go you know she never did say that to me there are around 10 evictions just like this one every day in Richmond as a consequence of this fast-track justice budget hotels on the outskirts of the city have become a refuge for those who've been kicked out of their homes some people stay there for a very long time among them is David a 38 year old gardener david has lived in this motel since his eviction two years ago at the weekend the divorced father's children come to stay over in his one-room home which cost him 1300 it is our bedroom living room family room every room this is a little kitchen which I cooked her eggs last night and made hamburgers so I ain't cleaning the dishes you know we hung out played video games and bathroom you know got a shower but um that's about all during the week David shares this single room which has packed with household utensils and personal possessions with his new partner for two years here oh man I'm not cramped you know like obviously if you put two people in the same room for a long enough time it's theirs you're gonna bump heads and have arguments and stuff his girlfriend has a stable job in the insurance business they could buy a bigger and less expensive apartment yet they remain trapped in this tiny room because their past eviction continues to haunt them but at the time she was she was trying at first and then I'm what you get so beat down by going to places and stuff and them not they're not giving you a place because they're like oh you had an eviction it's you know shows that you didn't pay just like two months or something like that and it definitely was a detriment to it you know there was no way of getting anywhere it's almost unthinkable in many parts of the world but here landlords are able to access the past of bad tenants with a few simple clicks a systematic surveillance system that has been denounced by Martin vague bright a lawyer and defense attorney for tenants so this database is a public database I mean anyone can go on to this database and look at it and you can search by name so let's try a common common American name here we go Oh Mary Gillespie okay there we go and you can see five unlawful detainers let's see ten years ago this tenant had a series of late payments despite being small amounts in this case under $300 they can have grave consequences so if I'm a landlord I can look at that and say well that was 10 years ago but I think she's too much of a risk I don't want to rent to her if anything bad happens to you whether it's you know you get your hours cut back at work whether you break an ankle and you're off work for a month whether you got that car repair bill or that hospital bill or anything that just throws your budget off slightly you better catch up real quick or you're gonna have a judgment of possession against you and get addicted so the tenant really is living under the sword of damocles David is far from an isolated case six thousand three hundred people are evicted across the US every day in the city finding accommodation is the chief source of anxiety but there's a region where for some the main worry is simply being able to put food on the table welcome to rural America the Appalachian Mountains region that spans several states in the eastern part of the country [Music] Appalachia was once widely known for its coal production these days almost all of the mines are closed it's often said that the American dream got lost somewhere along the way here [Music] the Appalachia region with the predominantly white population is home to some of the poorest counties in the entire country [Music] during the summer at lunchtime this food truck travels up and down the disadvantaged areas of Roanoke Luz and Stacy are two volunteers who give out free meals to children they serve up to 200 meals a day and every time they arrive they're eagerly awaited on today's menu a sandwich a carton of milk and a Kiwi in this family both parents are unemployed they receive 1200 euros of welfare a month but as a family of five it's barely enough to live on well try to get in at least two to three but towards the end of the month when the stamps run low maybe I usually skip breakfast and lunch and yeah breakfast or lunch and then I eat dinner so that's yes being poor to the point of starving this reality is nothing new in the Appalachia region during his 1964 election campaign lyndon b johnson visited Appalachia and was horrified by the poverty he saw after his reelection he launched a master plan to put an end to poverty and now declares unconditional war on poverty in America one of his ideas was to create food stamps coupons given free of charge to the poor to this day the government distributes these food stamps to 40 million American people in this mobile home park in the heart of Appalachia the majority of families benefit from this food aid with the American flag hanging from the front steps this is the mobile home of 58 year-old Tsai Rainier Collins a former Marine serene E&O longer works following a long-term illness she receives a pension of 700 euros she faces a daily struggle to get by and her financial difficulties have gotten worse since she took in her niece Jennifer's an unemployed single mother who has three children to take care of Leah Lindsay and Jayden fortunately Jennifer receives food stamps every month on the first day according to how many kids you have and your income they put you know so much on there and I get every month on the first I'll get like six forty six hundred forty dollars just basically yes for food yeah five hundred and sixty euros a month to feed five people a tight budget before going shopping the two women check the balance on their card Sarah Nia and Jennifer can spend their food coupons in any supermarket like this discount store where they regularly go shopping once at the checkout the food stamp card works just like any other credit card and in this store in Appalachia they are by no means the only ones who use one how many people be with food stamps here probably have two it's a lot yeah yeah thank you Donald Trump plans to cut down on the amount of food stamp recipients critics say that risks making an already vulnerable Society even poorer [Music] but ironically here they voted 80% in favor of Trump and their support for him continues seemingly unabated to earn a little extra cash Serena does household chores for her neighbours for a few dollars she also cuts James's hair he works in a mine and is a loyal Trump follower I am yeah I do support Trump why because you've done everything he said he'd that you know Trump is willing to help other countries but his country comes first that's not I haven't been a long time Donald Trump is a billionaire Donald Trump keeps his family everywhere he goes his children his wife were everywhere with you that tells you a lot about a person that unwavering support can be difficult to understand for outsiders because since Trump's election everyday life for individuals in Appalachia has not improved poverty is pervasive here and has led to some strange developments in the middle of the night in this small town dozens of cars enter a show ground sold out ok I suggest that you be back here about three or four o'clock well it kind of drips you out cuz it makes you think you it's like it's everybody's lined up like you're going to a concert and you get learns to keep you keep your daughter stuff it you know what these people are gathering for here on mass is simply to see a doctor because every year here for a weekend a nonprofit organization arranges free consultations oh there's the huge name a lot of their families in this area are the working-class families they're struggling to choose between paying for medicine that can save their life or you know groceries for the week so it's it's a shame to have to do it this way but you got to take care of your people and these are our people and this is the way we take care of our people even though the health care system improved under previous President Barack Obama twenty-eight million Americans remain without any insurance coverage Saira Nia has arrived with her family her niece Jennifer and her three children they all need to see the dentist medical fees and the US are the most expensive in the world and unaffordable for a large section of the population so staying up all night seems like a small price to pay yeah it's not easy but you have to do it absolutely the alternative is not a good thing so have to the family arrived the night before because here the rule is first-come first-served at six o'clock in the morning the doors open the organizers call our patients by their number 127 somebody sound asleep in the car 128 so next time we'll call in groups of twenty again alright once inside the patients find themselves in a full-scale field hospital images reminiscent of a humanitarian disaster and yet this is modern-day America here people are treated in turn by a host of volunteers nurses family doctors but also specialists who are able to treat more complicated illnesses [Music] the most remarkable part takes place in this Sports Hall transformed into a gigantic dental care facility all day long 60 dentists scale drill fill and remove teeth she surveys the scene sigh Renia is overcome with emotion it's beautiful all the people volunteering so many people getting help that need it before my sister passed away she had all her teeth taken out and she didn't have any teeth to replace him with and she was younger than I am now and she was my older sister so I think about what she went through with health issues because of her teeth they're important she'll be seen to by a young student soon to complete his medical degree before treating Sri Nia he's had time to familiarize himself with the job he will spend a quarter of an hour removing Serena's tooth his sixteenth of the day but there's no time to take a breather here Cyrenian now proceeds to the locker rooms a dental prosthesis studio like the rest of the temporary facility it's run by volunteers and funded by donations don't play him it just relax lives relax first patients have dental impressions made in this room and next door a new set of teeth is created in less than two hours Sri Nia can look forward to showing off her new smile [Music] [Laughter] and know that I can smell and build it yes if the family had paid for all this treatment it would have cost them over $3,000 fortunately in the United States there are people personally taking action to help those in need on the other side of the country a man has embarked upon a mission to combat the poverty that has plagued the sidewalks of his city a place usually associated with the rich and famous rather than the down-and-out this is Los Angeles Los Angeles in Hollywood 38 year-old Elvis is appalled at how conditions in LA have continued to deteriorate in recent years it's not a third world country it's one of the richest countries in the world it's almost like a movie prop they don't it's hard to fathom that like every single day this is how people live Los Angeles the sprawling City of Angels and the glamorous heart of Hollywood cinema and yet today it is the homeless capital of America here in the last few years the number of people without a home has increased from 33,000 to 59 thousand in the shadows of the city skyline is the dark side of the Californian Dream when I was a kid and lived here it was nothing like it is now I left for almost two decades and I came back a few years ago and it just it just blows my mind it's just going to increase because every month the cost of everything keeps going up there's no regulation so in apartment owners and landlords can raise the money you know the rent whenever they like but nobody's paychecks are getting bigger outraged by the growing distance all of us gave up his job as a sales assistant he lives on the salary of his partner Leah who works at a university in this way Elvis can devote all his time to helping those less fortunate a little further from downtown a woman has moved in beneath this bridge Elvis and Leah regularly pay her a visit [Applause] kami has been living here for five years in a small tent that she shares with another woman they're desperately vulnerable to the dangers of the street and have already been assaulted several times they just tore it right open and now now she doesn't even have a door when she sleeps out here at night there's also no lights and you know especially as a woman that's pretty damn scary even if a guy walk right in do whatever they want to help these people Elvis wants to do more than just bring them bottles of water his main project is hidden away in the yard of this church he came up with the idea to build small wooden houses for the homeless they're very small but inside Elvis and Leah have thought of every last thing to improve the daily lives of these people window arms yes so what does it mean so if someone tries to open the window the alarm will go off this right here allows people to sleep when people sleep they can think they can do better they feel better they want better the house is also equipped with a fire alarm a light and a phone charger all of which are powered by a solar panel each cabin costs the equivalent of a thousand euros financed by donations collected online but Elvises well-meaning initiative is illegal the mayor of Los Angeles has banned him from installing his cabins on the sidewalks of the city Elvis will carry on regardless this morning his delivering one of them to a homeless couple who very much need it hey I'm Elvis nice to meet you I'm brownie Christa is the 32 year old and is three months pregnant she lives on the curb of the sidewalk with her partner Andre for four years now the couple have been sleeping in this tiny cart that is a health hazard on wheels I could say you can everything all these little different walks management mostly not being able to have good hygiene Elvis can't hang around the trick is to get this get this done and off before the cops show up the tiny house weighs 400 kilograms but his project does not make everyone happy why don't you go back in your house and enjoy the air conditioning a neighbor expresses her discontent she's against this why she she doesn't want it in front of her house she's calling the police and so we need to hurry along and we'll pray that they are allowed to keep their house this is how it goes in Los Angeles yeah please God looked at both of you congratulations a few days after filming the police threatened to destroy the cabin unless Elvis removed it he and the couple managed to move it on to privately owned land in the end the disgruntled neighbor got her way but we find people elsewhere trying to challenge the ostracization of homeless people in rather inventive ways our next stop is Texas and the conservative City of Waco it has around 50 churches serving its 120,000 residents here once a month a religious community organizes a curious program people come from all over the United States to take part [Music] you know wasn't weapon for you what what do you know we're gonna be for 24 hours these high school students are going to live eat and sleep in a role-playing scenario much like 20 or so other participants all from middle class backgrounds each of them has paid 60 euros to participate Janet Darrell came up with the idea 25 years ago with her husband a pastor the remarkable simulation project has so far had 30,000 participants the goal is to create compassionate care for humanity and poverty everybody can get the American Dream but when you're trapped in poverty and the cycles of poverty Janet Terrell says in order to truly experience the life of a homeless person you have to start by looking like them in this second-hand store participants are encouraged to dress in appropriate clothes jeans but I think that Skeeter's off of my ankles so that I'm happy about that right now it doesn't seem like too much of a challenge but things are going to get more complicated with the second-stage sleeping out in the open will be it not in the streets but in a secured fenced off yard 53 year old martyr however is slightly concerned I'm scared of bugs she thought long and hard before signing up it was her husband who convinced her to take part he doesn't look like real on this situation right right yes yes it doesn't smell like poop it doesn't smell like urine there's a rat running everywhere yeah no this is definitely luxury homelessness yeah a fact that is a comfort nonetheless although it won't be a very long night at 6 o'clock the next day janitor L gives everyone a wake-up call and they don't look particularly well-rested it's not real unless situation in their safe they're saving them being on the street but this is not as safe as being in the home with their family so it just gives them a little bit more reality of what living in the environment does on your body so by tonight it takes about 24 hours to really start getting the idea that this this could be really rough for the next stage of the program the participants are sent to downtown Waco their task today is to find something to eat from their own and without any money [Music] you can smell the food so should should I ask this guy cannot beg for silly people at restaurant like in many other cities in the US begging is a punishable offense it's also forbidden to rummage through garbage bins oh there's no food in there there's city property and reclaiming anything at all from them is considered stealing in order to survive the homeless and Wako are therefore forced to break the law our two participants are not going to find anything to eat and after two hours of walking the streets in 40 degrees heat marta feels faint she calls her husband to pick her up but I feel like I feel like I'm too weak well we're gonna shoot like I'm too old and fat and I can't do it you've learned something about yourself and what it would like what would be like to be homeless at your age yeah and be hard is the us truly ready to face up to poverty while the president claims America has never been so great forty million of tramps fellow citizens are still caught in the clutches of poverty [Music]

64,0,How the rich get richer – money in the world economy | DW Documentary,"Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market – the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? For years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: """"This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."""" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

continue to pump money into the world we are being flooded by trillions of dollars and euros it can't go on forever it's a ticking time it's never been easier for investors to get their hands on cheap money running up debts is practically free of charge organizations are just borrowing large amounts of money from each other and then using that to make money by lending it to others who are using that to lend it to others a snowball system that lets the rich become even richer savers on the upper hand are losing billions every year thanks to low interest rates if you just open a savings account it's almost like burning money this deluge of money has created deals worth billions companies are bought and sold for vast sums because loans are cheap the employees become the pawns of the speculators the question is where's all this money going [Music] [Music] we're in bud Borden Dauphine western germany this couple faces the same dilemma as many others what to do with their savings in this world of low interest rates karl-heinz eyes a recently retired court bailiff knows all about money and debts his life insurance policy is due to pay out soon how should he invest the money in a house they've already got one there's a lot at stake for the cycling enthusiast he and his wife wants security in old age as well as a good time I was hoping that after the payout I'd be able to invest the money again and earn interest which could be added to a pension but that plan isn't going to work out karl-heinz has always led a modest life he always stayed away from investments that paid high returns but were risky he never thought it would come to this he doesn't know what to do with interest rates this low and nor do his friends some have told me they won't keep their money in a bank account anymore instead they'll deposit it as physical cash in a safe [Music] it's fairly worth going to the bank interest on savings is almost zero at just 0.01 percent that means that he gets one cent for every hundred euros per year what's happening with his money [Music] people are worried says the director at the local branch of Volks Bank Elmar Schmitz although there hasn't been a run on the safe deposit boxes yet there have been more requests to keep money in cash or gold since we've seen a continuing fall in interest rates over the past eight years I need a crystal ball to tell you whether it'll stay like this for long I think we'll have this situation for another two or three years after that things will change again but we won't have the interest rates we had ten or twenty years ago it seems in the India puts in Spanish and a magazine hub the manager knows who he blames for these low interest rates the European Central Bank the remit of the ECB is clear price stability it uses the base rate as its tool to deliver that and it's been lowering the base rate steadily ever since the financial crisis down to zero savers are left by the wayside but countries with high levels of debt such as Greece are able to get their hands on cheap money so too can a lien banks in southern Europe the cheap money is supposed to fuel growth by buying government bonds the ECB has pumped additional trillions of euros into the markets otherwise the system would face potential collapse the price of all this is a deluge of money the money has to go somewhere into shares in real estate which continued to rise in price the result is a massive concentration of wealth right at the top Bill Gates the world's richest man has a fortune of 65 billion euros that's the market value of his shares to compare the total value of all of the world's cash is less than 100 times that amount five trillion euros the value of all goods and services created every year around the world is 75 trillion euros that's the real economy the world's debts are far higher than that state's businesses and private individuals all have debts a world living on credit 705 trillion that's the value of only derivatives the speculative financial bets on the future they've got almost nothing to do with real goods any more to recap this is the fortune of Bill Gates [Music] what happens when there's too much money in the world economist max otter says this deluge of cheap money isn't just flooding the big banks he sees low interest rates as the symptom of a massive sickness in the global financial system what's more cheap money endangers the entire economy and promotes increasing levels of debt he says those who believe that with the financial crisis of 2008 receding things are now better again are much mistaken this influx of money is extremely dangerous it's slow but at some point the dam will burst and then we'll be in a huge crisis the biggest danger is that this flood of cheap money will split our society it moves money from the bottom upwards he says a gigantic redistribution machine [Music] low interest rates are demanded by many economists they mean that states can borrow on the cheap states can take on more debt it also means the rich can do the same and often without any liability if they default if I as one of the super-rich buy a business they're not only liable to the extent of my holding not with the rest of my wealth that's a blatant injustice compared to middle class families and regular people with home construction this flood of money doesn't just save States and banks it also favors the rich who use this cheap money to buy shares companies and real estate with rapidly rising values while the financial investments of ordinary people lose value the middle the middle classes have savings and insurance policies and these investments are the losers in a low interest rate world armen poorest citizens suffer because real estate prices are going up and therefore rents to either stagnant and one RT Midlands like Londyn the world's largest financial center illustrates very clearly the effect of this monetary deluge trillions are traded here 300,000 employees in the financial sector are trying to turn money into even more money London's own real estate prices are skyrocketing all the major banks have offices here this is where the money of the world's rich is invested Roman borisovitch knows the scene well there are neighborhoods where millionaires are being pushed out by billionaires borisovitch is fighting against a sell-off of the City of London to speculators together with colleagues he has researched the anonymous owners of several properties as a former banker he's familiar with price developments well these are views houses and again depending on the size it's difficult to say how deep they are but anywhere between three to five maybe five to seven million on this on this pitch in this particular area five to seven million pounds now if you think about Mews houses this is a family place think about what kind of family can afford to buy a house for three to five four even for five to serve seven million pounds the expensive houses are all speculative objects and empty London belongs to investors who don't live in the city roman borisovitch discovered that this townhouse was sold to a ukrainian billionaire for 66 million pounds [Music] on paper the mansion is owned by a shell company right now there is an excess of 40,000 properties in London that are owned by anonymous offshore corporations meaning that we don't know who the owners it could be decent people they could be mafia there are four we suspect that a lot of this money that came through London that it exploded prices here is actually of dirty origin there's construction underway everywhere speculating with real estate is the big game in town trillions of euros from Russians Germans Chinese and Indians have poured into London from socio-economical perspective it is not sustainable you cannot have a city where a residents and workers cannot cannot live you know this this is a this is what the problem with bubbles is that nobody knows when they're gonna burst but London doesn't have a monopoly on real estate bubbles they now exist in cities around the world if a real-estate bubble were to burst sure it would hit the wealthy you are invested there but they have a diverse investment portfolio they seize opportunities around the world if the real-estate bubble in Munich were to burst they'll be in Rio or Tokyo they can act globally but the middle class can't as seen in the financial crisis of 2008 the middle class is hit while the rich get richer in times of boom and bust not much has changed the minor regulations introduced into the financial sector aren't very tangible here in London the speculators are looking for new ways to make more money in the world's number one financial center many transactions are now taking place in the shadow banking system the bonuses the lucrative deals are as plentiful as ever and brexit will see the regulations relaxed even further the show must go on Alf Townsend has lived through it all he's been driving a taxi for 54 years chauffeuring bankers and brokers around the city dealing in the world's trillions has become the trump card of the British economy he says optimistically beneficial to London I think it's a there's people who invest whether whatever part of the world I come from if they want to invest their money in the city that's good for being British you comment our economy yeah he too has profited but in exchange Alf has to live far outside the city centre a million pounds for a single room apartment no ordinary local can afford that there's not many Londoners that part from us old people we're still live in London most of a book of some of their houses as I was saying earlier bought their houses off the council made a fat profit sold it moved out to a suburban hideaway yeah some leave the city entirely and forever gerund Anderson was one of London's financial stars he now lives in Wales he paid the same for his farm as he would have to pay for a tiny single room apartment in downtown London but that's not the only reason why he came here he's had enough of the financial excesses the city is full of greedy ruthless clever people and if they put bit more regulation a little bit more compliance some restrictions these guys work out how to game the system to make sure that it benefits them today he writes novels and screenplays about the financial world he used to earn a few hundred thousand pounds a year he didn't care who the trades heard that's a few years ago now but nothing has changed says Anderson the system rewards those who make fat deals at the expense of others I make lots of strange Gamble's incredible reckless decisions but they come good then I make huge amounts of money if they go bad maybe I lose my job but that's the only downside so this is what it's called an asymmetrical risk it encourages short-term gambling Anderson is certain that the financial system will keep growing and sprawling the prospects of big profits the low interest rates the deluge of money the former financial Insider believes these elements make for an explosive mix the Ponzi system that exists is such that organizations are just borrowing large amounts of money from each other and then using that to make money by lending it to others who are using that to lend it to others which means that you have a system where ultimately no one's really got the money that backs up all the money that's being lent out subsequently when that system comes crashing down then it's good night attacks on speculative financial transactions could slow this merry-go-round however this financial transactions tax would need to be introduced globally but even the small-scale version with just 10 new states failed after years of negotiations even though German Finance Minister Wolfgang Scheidler personally pushed for this tax but Britain was against it and will be even more against it in the future London as a financial center would suffer that's most regrettable because this tax would be the necessary surgery for the sick financial system the ECB and other central banks flooding the world with cheap money isn't a cure it's just pain relief and in the long run it has serious side effects the entire setup is a system that keeps saving itself temporarily but at some point it will inevitably fall apart until then it accessor baits the enormous injustice that already exists those who have benefit a handful of super rich individuals own as much as the poor a half of the world's population combined this flood of money is increasing the gap between rich and poor even further people like these are struggling at the hands of low interest rates karl-heinz Aish and his friends are worried in the past the world was a veritable paradise for savers the economy was booming and interest rates were high even if inflation was - nevertheless successive generations lived by the motto those who save get more out of life in the past you could rely on a certain interest rate for your savings account you could live with that in the 70s we got a fixed rate of 7% for a short while we got 11% karl-heinz i has an appointment with his financial advisor at the bank what should he do with his money we have this account and next year a life insurance policy will mature for huge what can we do with this money the adviser wants to know about her clients readiness to take risks he's actually more risk-averse and wants to invest his insurance money as broadly as possible every day it sits in the savings account it loses purchasing power and he knows that davia goofy calluses since you're getting almost no interest we have to see where we can generate a return and that means stocks and chairs investing more in property bonds and chairs that's what his bank advises what else can he do in times like these I don't feel uneasy or really comfortable with the idea although I've generally had positive experiences to date shares property bonds higher risk whether he likes it or not karl-heinz edge has to participate in the game of the big financial world it's an industry in party mood big companies are buying up competitors thanks to low interest rates thereby increasing their share value only shareholders benefit from their strategy and they tend to be affluent German chemical giant buyer bought American seed supplier Monsanto for example for 65 billion euros [Music] the world's largest brewery anheuser-busch InBev swallowed the number two sabmiller for the equivalent of over a hundred billion euros and software giant Microsoft bought professional networking site LinkedIn for twenty six billion companies as the playthings of international financial interests a less prominent case wmf has been based in guys Lingam in southwest Germany since the mid 19th century it's a brand with a world-class reputation wmf manufactures cutlery and coffee makers it used to be in the hands of German owners and shareholders its operations meant security for thousands of families then the financial gamblers set their sights on wmf the company has changed owners three times in the past 11 years every time it sold the price goes up enormously at the same time wages and working conditions have worsened there were massive protests when the company was taken over by French group Seb Martin Porsche Co hoped things would finally get better again he's on his way to a wmf Works meeting on behalf of the IG Metall labor union he thinks it's symptomatic of today's age how easily a deal worth billions is made the investors that the big banks can get their hands on cheap money no problem the new owner paid 1.6 billion euros it's so easy for investors to buy and sell businesses and achieve huge profits you've never achieved that through a company's day-to-day operations the question for me is to what extent is it harmful when jobs become a pawn in this game in Vevey I started to us some speed buy out the albeit split salami a works meeting during unsettling times at wmf what are the prospects with the new owner the staff have had bad experiences in the past we've been not like a cold blood dry when there's nothing left to get out we're sold off thank you for busting here it's been that way for years everyone lines their pockets we can only hope the company survives and that commerce restored at least the employees are told today that the new buyers do not intend to cannibalize wmf further before selling it on but union representative Martin pushka knows the only way such deals can be paid for is through extremely low interest rates on loans the dealer wmf went as follows new york-based equity firm KKR bought wmf for around 660 million euros via a subsidiary located in a tax haven KKR used 100 million of their own capital and borrowed five hundred and sixty million from banks four years later KKR sold wmf to French household equipment maker sed for 1.6 billion a deal supported by very low interest rates KKR made a profit of nine hundred and forty million euros after repaying the loan and investing just a hundred million of its own capital that's a return of more than eight hundred percent a lucrative deal but only for KKR shareholders that's possible because at the moment there's enough money on the global market other investors are able to pay such prices if the money weren't there they wouldn't be able to shift such volumes loans for almost nothing that's the flipside of the money deluge financial investors do deals with huge sums that would have been unthinkable in the past in a regulated financial system today many wish for a return to those times the deregulation of the financial world has a long history [Music] until 1971 the world was financially stable currencies were covered by gold the real economy was imbalance with the amount of money available then u.s. President Nixon needed money for the Vietnam War he switched on the money printing machine not least because OPEC had increased oil prices this money then flooded the world banks came up with new investment models they now wanted to make money not with goods but with money alone this was the start of the financial industry of today credit cards and current accounts accelerated financial transactions former public responsibilities were privatized pensions are a case in point the private sector is better at everything than the state so they said new billions came into play in the 1980s Margaret Thatcher deregulated the banks in London Bill Clinton did the same later on Wall Street Chancellor Gerhard schröder in Germany then also bought into the deregulation philosophy money was to earn money and thereby create growth the global casino was open for business path of liberalisation was a mistake it's the wrong word - if you deregulate markets that need to be regulated then you create chaos you unleash an avalanche of money onto the world you can call that liberalisation but it was a policy that benefited only a few people namely the rich it has caused a lot of problems for the world in the liberalisation or deregulation allowed the deals of the banks to explode they now acted internationally major banks have become investment establishments that fund huge deals more and more money goes into speculation that's where the big money is made this has less and less to do with the real economy of the central bank's alone responsible for this influx of money or where does it all come from economic students in Zenon Germany are investigating just that what do people know about the origin of money that's what they want to find out we're from the University of Zagan were doing a research project about money what does money mean to you you can't do anything without money where does the money come from not from me that's for sure how was money made through work of course I'm not sure in banks by the state I couldn't tell you the responses were sobering is that zero it was really varied a lot of people had no response at all some said the bank or that it's just printed and some mentioned manipulation most had no idea for years financial expert he'll get poked at has been annoyed that money plays almost no role in economics many consider it just in neutral means of exchange it's in the course of macro discuss an issue and a strange that it's not just the public who are in the dark the students Street survey demonstrated that well enough but the money creation process also seems to be something of a mystery among academics and even in the banking boardrooms the banks are silent for a reason they would have to explain to their customers that these days it's them creating the money and them benefiting hugely as a result as Poquette explains money isn't neutral after all it's not the central banks but private banks that generate most of this new money a process also known as deposit money creation get continued very money is created when someone goes to a bank to take out a loan the bank opens an account and issues the funds its then in a contract with the individual who's taken out the loan the bank hopes that person will pay it back someday that means what the original impulse to create money comes from private banks that's new to most people many think alone works like this savers take money to the bank and the bank loans this money to a customer such as someone buying a house or running a business but that's not the case if someone has savings their money is parked in a savings account the advantage for the bank is that person can't just take it out when the bank issues alone it's created from nothing these two processes really don't have anything to do with each other even though it looks that way and even though that's what the textbooks are say this is how it works a customer wants to take out a loan for ten thousand euros the bank has to deposit between one and three percent so at least a hundred euros with the central bank that's it in return the bank is allowed to transfer ten thousand euros to the customers account at the push of a button the bank generates ten thousand euros of electronic money from a hundred euros and in return it collects the interest this creation of deposit money is a license to make money the bank is an additional the banks are happy of course that they can do this because that gives them a free rein they get to keep the profits the senior age that's a few billion every year who'd want to miss out on that that's definitely not them private banks basically create new money as they wish that used to be the privilege of the mint of princes and governments it's a privilege to create money and therefore profits out of nothing this privilege has been in the hands of the financial industry for a long time and in recent years it's been unchecked is that really such a good idea for this the big banks in particular have massively increased the money deluge in this way as a way of imposing more controls on the financial system again private banks could be deprived of the privilege of creating money developments are already underfoot in Switzerland Zurich is a popular location with banks there's an initiative here that advocates reining in the Swiss banks in future it says only the National Bank should be allowed to create money not private banks anymore the initiative is fighting for fully backed money and an end to the privilege of big banks to generate electronic money at the push of a button reinholt halyna used to be city treasurer in st. Gallen it was then he understood that we can't carry on with limitless loans and debts 90% of all our money is just numbers on a computer in a bank somewhere the bank's make this money that's what we find worrying and that's what we want to change great things have small beginnings with members of the initiative are striking a chord with many passers-by they distrust the financial system the major banks are creating a spiral of loans and debt with their money creation I'm a former banker now retired I can't say that with pride anymore their casinos know I'm coding it's the up money pulley up finale the manipulation happens everywhere we in the future generation and being robbed at the moment it's primarily the big banks who are pocketing the profits of this money-making enterprise the Swiss initiative wants these billions to benefit the country's citizens by only allowing the National Bank to create money we want to take away the right of banks to create money but we're not taking away a line of business they'll still be allowed to lend money and manage assets and the oversea financial transactions the banks get to keep all of that they want their National Bank to play a key role in the future [Music] private banks would only be allowed to issue loans if they have the money in their vaults 100% secure private banks would not be allowed to create deposit money anymore and the profits from this privilege would also benefit the National Bank the general public are the winners the National Bank is obligated to look after their well-being the group want the creation of money to be state controlled and not in the hands of private banks billions in interest payments would then flow into the public purse I support these various initiatives banks wouldn't be able to create new money they'd have to work with the money they have and deposits that's a good first step it's not enough but it's an important step on the path towards a fair financial systems often beats I don't feel good system it appears absurd on the one hand the world is flooded with cheap money but at the same time some places have none the places that don't offer big profits right away but that in the long term would benefit the future of our society we're at the impact hub in Munich an office space for startups a space for companies that have innovative ideas for the future new technologies sustainable solutions for our problems but there's no money here Louden Han and his team are working on a car for the future for example their baby goes by the name Z on a small electric car that generates some of its own electricity the city runaround is designed to access electricity from the well protected solar cells on the car body it will also source electricity from a battery it's an inexpensive and highly eco-friendly electric car developing the Z on costs money and no bank wants to stump up this money says lobbying on startups like his don't stand a chance of getting a loan from a bank even though there's more than enough money available banks are out of the question we're too risky banks prefer to invest in infrastructure something that's long-term and safe where the loan is secured our company goes bankrupt they have virtually nothing they could recoup levine Han had to collect money from private donors online venture capital no loans for their projects that's the central issue for young entrepreneurs they can't get their hands on any of this cheap money at the end of the day it's not about money but about creating opportunities so that people who want to do something can do something if you don't invest in that or the startups can't access money easily and can't develop easily then they'll move country there are lots of entrepreneurs here who want to push forward sustainable products and services products where the consequences for people and the environment are taken into account from the word go products designed to create value for society I think it's a scandal that companies like this struggle so much to access funding from banks or major investors karl-heinz Eisenberg Bowden Dorf invests in the traditional fashion he's received the money from his insurance policy and he's made a decision he's looking at his house with a painter and decorator he wants to invest some of the money in renovations [Music] a fixed asset investment a strategy to circumvent the low interest rates karl-heinz ash has realized in recent months how important it is to pay attention to money matters the times when we could hand over our responsibilities at the cashier's desk are over maybe he'll be fortunate but one thing is certain the sikh financial system is going to cost us a lot of money I don't think anyone will come out of this situation unscathed we've been living on loans there will be wealth destruction your current financial system is very likely to lead to the next disaster we need a different system but it would be enough if we just returned to what we had highly regulated financial markets and a banking sector under control and whose purpose was to serve Deenanath garbajosa we have to rein in the world's financial system but exactly the opposite is happening in the United States under Donald Trump to make the system safer for people a system like that envisage by the Swiss initiative could be one building block in particular states have to reduce their massive debts it's the only way we can curb this deluge of money and break through the spiral of loans that's also why we need international debt conferences where states mutually waive their debts it's ask the people they foot the bill big banks must cover their loans with more of their own capital than they do today there needs to be a global tax on financial transactions and money needs to go to places where it benefits society for our futures sake [Music] the interests of the financial industry have determined developments in politics and society for far too long Trump and brexit mustn't be allowed to fuel that even further money is far too important to be left to the banks alone

66,,The History of Japan Documentary,"The history of Japan covers Japan and its relation to the world. It is characterized by isolationist, semi-open and expansionist periods.The very first human habitation in the Japanese archipelago has been traced to prehistoric times around 30,000 BCE. The Jōmon period, named after its """"cord-marked"""" pottery, was followed by the Yayoi in the first millennium BC when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD. Between the fourth century and the ninth century, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the Emperor. This imperial dynasty continues to reign over Japan. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), marking the beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism.Over the following centuries, the power of the Emperor and the imperial court gradually declined, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats – most notably the Fujiwara – and then to the military clans and their armies of samurai. The Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoritomo emerged victorious from the Genpei War of 1180–85, defeating their rival military clan, the Taira. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in Kamakura and took the title of shōgun. In 1274 and 1281, the Kamakura shogunate withstood two Mongol invasions, but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the Muromachi period. During the Muromachi period regional warlords called daimyōs grew in power at the expense of the shōgun. Eventually, Japan descended into a period of civil war. Over the course of the late sixteenth century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the prominent daimyō Oda Nobunaga and his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power and was appointed shōgun by the Emperor. The Tokugawa shogunate, which governed from Edo (modern Tokyo), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the Edo period (1600–1868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a strict class system on Japanese society and cut off almost all contact with the outside world.This video is made for educational purposes only.COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER UNDER SECTION 107 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1976Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for """"fair use"""" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

things they do are beyond imagining and it may be truly said that Japan is a world the reverse of Europe to the first Westerners in Japan it was a mysterious world it was the fabled Isle of zipangu that Marco Polo had only heard about the land of riches that Christopher Columbus set out to find when the Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543 they encountered a country embroiled in civil war out of this chaos one samurai warrior would emerge he would create a regime so strong it endured for over 250 years witnesses to this world both Western observers and Japanese wrote at these changing times theirs is a story of flowering culture of poetic ritual and of rigid power struggles it is the saga of opening trade with Europe and then closing its doors to the west these are the memoirs of Japan's secret Empire [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] on the 25th day of the eighth month of the year of the water and the hair there appeared off our western shore a big ship no one knew whence it had come as a Buddhist monk later recounted samurai guards were quickly dispatched to warn their master there were strangers on board these ships unlike anyone the Japanese had ever seen the local warlord called a daimyo summoned these strangers the first Europeans to ever set foot on Japanese Shores it was the year 15 43 when these Portuguese merchants arrived the daimyo was intrigued by their peculiar unknown weapons the Japanese always liked novel things new things are fed so to speak and so they were very very interested in the Europeans after he watched the Portuguese shoot down a duck the daimyo purchased two guns and put his swordsmith to work making copies then he asked for shooting lessons these first Europeans their guns and their religion would have unforeseeable consequences in this same year a boy was born to a daimyo family he would be known as Tokugawa Ieyasu his destiny would be to change Japan forever as an elite member of the samurai class the boy inherited a world of tradition a feudal realm of samurai warriors who ruled by birthright and soared the son of a daimyo Lord Ieyasu would soon have to give up children's games for the politics of war [Music] when EARC was still a child the ruling daimyo demanded that EI osos father send the young boy to him as a hostage insurance that all orders would be obeyed [Music] when children were taken as hostages it did not mean prisoners this was all part of the political negotiation in which our alliances had to be formed because no one trusted no one else so there had to be guarantee and therefore that hostage was used as a hostage the young samurai boy traveled in the style befitting his daimyo rank he could not know his destiny nor could he know that he would never see his father again he would grow up a hostage his life captive to the turmoil of Civil War [Music] the whole of Japan was involved in wars treachery was rampant and nobody trusted his neighbor they would enter into league with one faction and then deserted for another as the winds of Fortune blew [Music] while Rodriguez an eyewitness to these perilous times was one of the first Portuguese to arrive in Japan he came as a cabin boy of 15 and would soon become a Jesuit missionary [Music] as Portuguese merchants traversed the oceans in search of new ports for trade Jesuit missionaries accompanied them searching for souls to save [Music] the Jesuits were young and dedicated braving the hardships of the dangerous two-year voyage to reach Japan a country which they considered ripe for conversion they sent home tantalizing reports of an alien world everything is so different an opposite that they are like us and practically nothing now all this would not be surprising if they were like so many barbarians but what astonishes me is that they behave as very prudent and cultured people in all these matters this is something which I would not dare to affirm if I had not had so much experience among them the missionaries thought that the Japanese were such a remarkable race their culture was so developed that it was worthwhile writing back to Europe about the culture which they found the language the Japanese spoke and a very complex political system without any influence from Christianity without any influence from Europe and so I think this is a thing which one should bear in mind that this was the first time Europeans dealt with Asians on equal terms and not as conquerors and conquered people their way of writing is very different from ours because they write from the top of the page down to the bottom I asked a Japanese why they did not write in our way and he asked me why we did not write in their way he explained that as a head of a man is at the top and his feet are at the bottom so - a man should write from top to bottom during his more than 30 years in Japan jawoll rodriguez became so fluent in Japanese he became known as the interpreter his work allowed him to observe all levels of society from the highest daimyo warlords to the lowest Japanese farmer every class of person Noble or humble uses a fan throughout the whole kingdom people who have business matters and other things which they wish to remember write them down on their fans they are always carrying these fans about in their hands opening them shutting them and looking at them nobody would go out into the street without one [Music] the Japanese schwa Rodriguez observed regarded the Europeans with equal fascination they greatly wondered that our big and long noses big beards and red or fair hair and considered all these things as so many defects they called them the southern barbarians which is not a very flattering term their eating habits were rather different the Japanese were so polite eating with chopsticks etc whereas in those days Europeans normally yet with just a knife and with your fingers and then of course the Japanese most the Japanese take a bath every day whereas Europeans I'm afraid in those days when for months and months and months without taking a bath and to some extent they deserved the epithet of barbarians but however they were regarded the missionaries were determined to stay in Japan our only desire was to preach and proclaim the law of the Creator even if there were only one Japanese Christian in the whole country any missionary would spend all his life here just for the sake of that one person these men were very very zealous and the conditions were rather good for the conversion of people to Christianity when you have bloodshed revolutions fighting battles death in large numbers obviously people's thoughts do tend to go to the next life in little more than 50 years these missionaries established over 200 Catholic churches primarily in southern Japan and converted up to a quarter million Japanese [Music] when a Japanese Lord or Japanese daimyo changed his religion he would bring pressure on his people because he had absolute power of life and death on the people below him and so you got in a relatively short short period of time a large-scale conversions but there was another factor that some of the daimyo when they became Christian they had certain considerations of Commerce in the back of their mind because where the missionaries went the Portuguese merchants went and the Portuguese merchants offered very profitable trade fees avi Japanese [Music] Commerce and religion intertwined some Japanese profited while others watched with growing concern convinced of Christianity's threat to their power merchants and missionaries these early Europeans have set a course which would eventually run into unexpected consequences [Music] to endure the rigors of never-ending training to remain clear minded in the face of grave danger to face death matter-of-factly this is the art of kendo the way of the sword master swordsmen taught young samurai the skills of sword fighting and the traditions of a samurai code of honor this was the education the young EARC would receive even as a hostage when you took a hostage in a certain place they were usually treated very cordially and they were given education just as they would be given at home he probably had a very stoic Spartan kind of education toward military skills martial arts and Chinese classics Japanese classics the entire life of yes was that of patience and forbearance people say the young hostage Tokugawa Ieyasu would learn what it meant to be a samurai adopter stands with the head erect either hanging down or looking up nor twisted do not roll your eyes nor allow them to blink but slightly narrow them brace your abdomen so that you do not bend at the hips [Music] a legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi would preserve the way of the samurai in a classic book the Five Rings it was a guide to strategy its philosophy embraced in Japan even to this day in all forms of strategy it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in everyday life and to make your everyday stance your combat stance at age 15 Ieyasu entered manhood and earned the right to carry the two swords of the samurai [Music] Hinata you know we don't even know shoujo the sword was a symbol of the samurai class only in the samurai were authorized to carry two swords a large one and a small one a samurai with these two swords ruled over the farmer in the merchant you're born into being a sama diets a responsibility amongst the responsibilities of being a song I was always carrying one sword to use to enact justice if somebody were rude to you it was your duty to kill them but still no sama knight would walk around outside without a sword and if they were caught without a sword they could be punished for not upholding their duty [Music] while the samurai class comprised less than 10% of the population their presents loomed larger than life even the missionaries wrote as if the samurai were the whole of society they carry a sword and dagger both inside and outside the house and lay them at their pillows when they sleep never in my life have I met people who rely so much on their arms they are very warlike and are always involved in wars and thusly ablis man becomes their greatest Lord it was not only the men who swore to uphold this ideal samurai women were also trained to protect their family the most important thing about samurais daughters or wives was never to forget the honor and the pride as samurais daughter in crisis there had to be prepared to kill themselves rather than being shamed disgraced by the enemies the samurai defended his home and family but his true glory came on the battlefield defending his lord against enemies the samurai dressed carefully for combat the finely stitched fabric and leather appeared elegant even fragile unseen were the tightly woven plates of Steel much like his protective armor a warrior's refined appearance concealed his impenetrable inner core this ethic preserved in writings of the samurai would prepare the warrior to meet life and death with honor our samurai would wash himself with cold water every morning sent the shaven top of his head in hair with incense to make himself presentable he was ready to be killed in battle at any moment cherry blossoms are often compared to the samurai they're a beautiful sight like the warrior in his shiny armor but it takes only one big storm for petals to fall to the ground just like the warrior in battle [Music] for Samurai as important as knowing how to kill was knowing how and when to die in the battlefield especially your last moment of life you have to show your control the controlling your body controlling your destiny faith is the vindication indication of your internal strength so it's a last moment that you have to stage your dis seppuku or harakiri is the ritual of suicide as practiced by samurai samurai warrior carried two swords on his head a long one and a short one the short sword was for cutting open his abdomen why would a son would I could open his abdomen well Japanese especially summer I believed that the heart was in the belly they believe that whether their heart was pure or impure would be revealed when they disemboweled themselves from the Deaf poem to the final thrust of the dagger seppuku is a ceremonial ritual of suicide ensuring an honorable death jawoll rodriguez wrote of a man who committed the ritual of seppuku the samurai dressed in the customary white kimono solemnly and with great dignity mounted a raised platform then in a loud voice he told them to watch him carefully as he cut himself open he seated himself and wrote his will slowly and calmly asking his Lord to look after his son and family for he was going to die on account of his honor he bade farewell and then in front of them all he fearlessly cut his belly and so he died this sort of thing often happens [Music] there is timing in everything timing in strategy cannot be mastered without a great deal of practice there is timing in the whole life of the warrior in his thriving and declining in his harmony and Accord these are the enduring principles which guided the life of the samurai warrior for Tokugawa Ieyasu patience strategizing would become his most powerful weapon he was now of age 18 years old and married with two children but he was still a hostage of the ruling daimyo warlord [Music] as time passed EOS has strengthened his skills as a warrior fighting alongside his daimyo Master when his master was killed in battle he a ASSA was finally free to determine his own destiny yes was put in a position to have to make a decision at some point whether to go along with the hostess family but at all times he never forgot his ambitions to go back to his original castle and to regain all the territory that his father's family had and to expand and to go back to his retainers who were faithfully waiting for Ieyasu reclaimed his title as an independent Lord a daimyo he returned to his family estate he could now fight on his own terms for his own people I fought against my enemies solely in order that I might take my revenge on my father's adversaries because I was convinced of the rightness of my intention to help the people and bring peace to the land the years of captivity had honed his discipline according to his samurai training he now carefully plotted his strategy in a crucial move Ieyasu allied himself with the man who killed his daimyo Master Oda Nobunaga [Music] Nobunaga had become the most powerful warlord in Japan feared and ruthless the missionaries owal Rodriguez documented Nobunaga's campaign to unify Japan Nobunaga was the first to begin cutting through the thick forest of wars and discord in Japan he subdued about half the country and fear of him made the remaining part ready to obey Him in anything [Music] in the Battle of Naga Shino Nobunaga armed 3,000 of his foot soldiers three ranks deep [Applause] [Music] as 10,000 enemy warriors charged Nobunaga's Musketeers fired in succession decimating the opposing army [Music] Nobunaga's innovations in the use of firearms completely changes the face of samurai warfare the old idea was where you would have two samurai meet on the field of battle they would shout out their names and their lineages where they were from sometimes one would ride out in front of all these troops and and challenge someone to come and defeat him so it was it was very manly it was imbued with the ideal of valor [Music] now you have faceless ranks of samurai shooting other faceless ranks of samurai [Music] Nobunaga continued to amass power until one night treachery within his inner circle caught him off guard a missionary was near by some Christians came just as I was vesting to say an early Mass and told me to wait because there was a commotion in front of the palace with once began to hear musket shots and see flames we learned that it had not been a brawl but that one of his generals had turned traitor some say he cut his belly while others believe that he set fire to the palace and perished into flames what we do know however is that of this man who made everyone trembled not only at the sound of his voice but at the mention of his name they did not remain even a small hair which was not reduced to dust and ashes as the flames burned Nobunaga's loyal general Toyotomi Hideyoshi seized the moment Hideyoshi immediately springs into action murdering the murderer of his own lord which then gives him the right in essence to claim leadership of Nobunaga's vast coalition of armies [Music] ei arson watched from a distance would he subordinate himself to Hideo she's command or was it time to fight for control [Music] Nobunaga Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu these were the men who would bring an end to the brutal civil wars they would go down in history as the unifiers there's a story in Japanese that explains the character of the three unifiers and Nobunaga Hideyoshi and das who are watching a cuckoo bird waiting for it to sing but the bird doesn't sing and Nobunaga says little bird if you don't sing I will kill you and Hideo she says little bird if you don't sing I'll make you sing and he asked us says little bird if you don't sing I'll wait for you to sing an da ah so is a patient strategist who will wait for things to go his way and then he'll act after Nobunaga's death Ieyasu and Hideyoshi faced off in a measured game of strategy each in his own way trying to outsmart the other Boojum Postino dee da silva nice Okara sin point that as a military leader Ieyasu was a courageous man who never hesitated in battle however though he was brave he was also cautious one famous story the acid was known as an excellent Horseman one day he and his troops had to cross a very narrow bridge over a raging river everyone was watching to see how the great house it would ride his horse over this dangerous bridge to his men surprise he also dismounted took the horses reins in his hands and carefully led the horse over the bridge to the other side of the river that's how vigilant he was I believe this kind of caution helped him to be victorious in battle while ei ah su practiced restraint and careful strategizing Hideyoshi acted quickly and decisively Hideyoshi was from peasant stock the son of a lowly foot soldier he worked his way up through the ranks Hideyoshi became known as a brilliant general and he held the same grand vision of himself when my mother conceived me she was given a miraculous omen on the very night that I was born the room was suddenly aglow with sunlight thirst changing night today finally they divined the child whose birth was attended by these miracles was destined to become a man of unusual attainments this prediction is fulfilled in me shortly after Hideyoshi took control Ieyasu challenged him but he a us who soon realized there was more to be gained as Hideyoshi zalae than as his enemy [Music] Hideyoshi rewarded EI r su for his loyalty with a vast domain of land and ordered him to make his headquarters in the remote fishing village of Edo 300 miles east of Hideyoshi's castle in osaka some might have thought the gift an insult but in Edo the village that would later become Tokyo ea also busied his troops building a massive five-story castle fortification [Music] [Music] within the walls of the city of Osaka Hideyoshi was consumed with fortifying his own castle reputed to be the most impregnable fortress of its time it was also one of the most ostentatious [Music] osaka castle had a strategic location close to the emperor's palace in nearby kyoto for centuries the emperor had remained a ruler in name only ignored by those who truly held power he wild away his days with court gossip calligraphy and poetry by EI haces time the court is still powerless but it is only the court which can appoint the children so in the ultimate symbolic sense the court is still the arbiter of final resort that's why all the Warlord's are aiming for Kyoto you have to get the Emperor to recognize that you're the most powerful of all of the combatants on the field of battle Hideyoshi curried the Emperor's favor inviting him to no plays and musical performances but the emperor would not grant this warrior of peasant stock the title of Shogun Yasu never relinquished his desire for power he offered the emperor more than invitations he arranged the marriage of one of his granddaughter's to the Emperor's son all of the lords in Japan used family to cement political alliances you would marry off daughters or area of sons what he a ass who did in particular was have an abundance of sons that he could use he could set them up to support his nascent government he could set them up as independent military lords that he could then call upon for help in contrast EAS is rival Hideyoshi failed to produce a male heir finally he adopted a nephew and groomed him as his successor then at sixty years of age Hideyoshi finally fathered a son of his own he called him Heda yuri and he was the jewel of his life hideo she's thoughts now turned to the safety and survival of his young son I cannot describe the endless tedium as if I were guarding an empty house when he day Ori is not here with me I say again strictly order that all be vigilant against fire each night have someone make the rounds of the rooms two or three times as Hideyoshi obsessed over his own son his adopted son now an adult was in peril it's clear that by the end of his life he Theo she was acting more and more erratically he became increasingly cruel if not sadistic then when he finally in his final years produced an air of his own he ordered this adult male who had been his heir to commit suicide Hideyoshi then ordered his adopted sons entire family put to death a missionary recanted they were drawn along the streets in a carts to the open view of the world 31 ladies and gentlewomen with the two sons and one daughter of his adopted son the oldest of whom was not more than five years old all their bodies were thrown into a pit for which was built a little chapel with a two-minute would this inscription the tomb of the traitors soon after he died oh she's health began to fail he wrote his death poem as the do I fall has the zhuhai vanish even Osaka fortress is a dream within a dream Hideyoshi then called Yasu and four of the most powerful daimyo to his deathbed he appointed them legal protectors of his five-year-old son he died Orie his heir and the future ruler of Japan ei are sooo pledged to protect the boy with his own life the pledge that would become very difficult to keep [Music] [Music] it is said that war is a curse it is resorted to only when it is inevitable however in time of peace do not forget the possibility of disturbances Ieyasu was on guard those daimyo who feared his growing power began to plot against him [Applause] ei haces territory now extended throughout most of Japan he was determined to maintain his holdings and expand his base of power one of the ASA's nicknames is the old badger and it reflects his craftiness as well as his famed ability to wait and he waits until after hideo she is dead until he has a clear preponderance of power and then makes his move to become the dominant military leader in Japan ei oz who mobilized his troops he sent one division to ogaki castle where his enemies were gathering when the battle began women and children rushed to safety EAS is sent a large force to lay siege to the castle and they fought day and night one of the young girls at the castle later told her family of the terrifying experience mother's concubines and daughters all stayed in the tower and cast bullets there was panel a bullet struck my younger brother killing him on the spot it was a cruel sight indeed it was we felt as if we should die there was nothing but fear and horror left as the battle wore on heads of slain warriors were brought to the castle to be prepared for the ritual presentation to the victor it was believed that even in death the samurai should be viewed as a worthy opponent those people who are in the castle would watch the heads and they've put some cosmetics on the face of the dead corpses because they were proof of having killed someone important that was part of them there is no part of what they did which is inconceivable to you know as modern people know more than women all the decapitated heads were brought into the tower we weren't a bit afraid of the heads and used to sleep in the midst of the nasty smell of bloody heads Victoria said ogaki Castle ei haces troops now pursued the rebellious daimyo and their armies they faced off in a narrow Valley just west of the village of Sekigahara this would be the battle that changed the course of Japanese history yay us who set up his command post atop a hill overlooking the valley waiting through the night for the rest of his armies to arrive at dawn ei haces attendant physician hastily noted in his journal slight rain dense fog in the mountain valley can't see barely made out enemy banners on horseback lord Yasu made out their positions estimate distance at two and a half miles EI ah su was outnumbered with only 50,000 troops challenging his enemies 80,000 he waited for his son to arrive with reinforcements but at 8:00 in the morning the fog suddenly lifted and the two opposing armies found themselves within striking distance EA us who could wait no more rallying his troops it was said he sent them forward with his famous battle cry there are only two ways to come back from the battlefield with the head of an enemy or without your own [Music] [Music] ei awesome watched as his troops faced what seemed insurmountable odds [Music] then suddenly the tide turned several enemy daimyo and their armies convinced of he asses ultimate victory defected and joined ei haces forces by 2 p.m. yay us whose troops had defeated the rebellious army so stick sticking out on the high eco grabbers victory at sucky Gaara brought an end to the warring States and signaled the beginning of a new era that's the significance of the Battle of Sekigahara in recognition of Ieyasu's power the Emperor awarded him the title of Shogun the Barbarian subduing Generalissimo Tokugawa Ieyasu now had the authority to rule Japan in all military matters he ruled unchallenged but always there was the specter of Hideyoshi's young son he de re growing up in osaka castle he a ah su had sworn with his life to protect the boy the boy who could someday lay claim to all yay ah su had won as the young boy he'd a re-approached manhood a daimyo warned although he is video she's err yes who will never let him go Japan sooner or later some ambitious character well foment rebellion in his name and even if he already knows nothing about it he will be blamed have forced to commit suicide to the grief of Hideyoshi's ghost now the tofu gods had no divine right to rule Japan they ruled Japan because they were the most powerful they had the most money they had the most soldiers but they had no divine right and there were many other powerful daimyo especially in the West the Christian daimyo and so if there were any philosophy any political movement that would bring these Dino together as a coalition against the Tokugawa family that was really dangerous Tokugawa Ieyasu tolerated no dissent he expelled many of the foreign missionaries including while Rodriguez yes who wanted to clear the board of all these foreign influences which were just muddying the waters making life more complicated he even ordered all Christian activity among the Japanese halted but still he faced the only true threat to his power the young-hee diary by the time he reaches adulthood he D or e can no longer be ignored by yeah so he's a threat simply because he exists he is the legitimate heir of Hideyoshi Ieyasu is supposed to be supporting him until he until he becomes an adult and he poses an intrinsic threat to the legitimacy of the Tokugawa Shogun Ieyasu came to but one conclusion he could no longer honor his pledge to a dead ally to protect his son he I also decided to go into battle once more it was obviously going to be another showdown and the many many many samurai in their thousands and these were hard-bitten warriors they still owed loyalty to Hideyoshi's family and of course they owed just as much loyalty to his son so they gathered in Osaka Castle and also Castle was a very very very strong car so it was considered impregnable [Music] in the winter of 1614 da ah so accused he de ré of subversion and ordered his troops to advance against Osaka Castle [Music] hideous supporters nearly 100,000 held strong ei ah sir retaliated with a devious plan he sent a woman samurai to negotiate a truce with he diores mother Ieyasu offered a safe haven for he de horas garrison if in return he agreed not to mount further rebellion against EA haces rule to prove his intentions EA us who signed the pledge in blood he de orys mother convinced her son to accept the offer EA haces ploy had worked as soon as the fighting stopped Ieyasu began to fill in the mooks of obstacle course of the deep moose and the people in the Osaka Castle protested a lot that was not in the agreement but that didn't matter they filled in the moats and once the moats were filled in then ieyasu's troops would storm into the castle and there was a dreadful slaughter [Music] thousands of defeated soldiers women and children fled the casstle compound [Applause] [Music] a European merchants recorded the event in his journal we had news today that da Yasu hath taken the fortress of Osaka and overthrown the forces of Hideyori they say the taking of this fortress have cost about one hundred thousand lives and that no dead man of account is found with his head on but all cut off yay ah sues army set the castle on fire [Music] as the flames raged around him he de re refused to surrender and was left with no other option he committed seppuku [Music] there's one big problem with killing udre however and that's that ei ASSA was supposed to be his supporter it's a very realistic cold-blooded strategy but he wanted to establish a dynasty that would last through the ages there is reason to believe that EA also genuinely regretted having to kill the son of his former Lord EOS o is said to have paid penance by writing the name of the Buddha ten thousand times on Scrolls of parchment [Music] tokugawa ieyasu had wiped out the last threats to his power or so it seemed but not everyone was under his control there were the Western traders who he valued but mistrusted and the Christians who he considered a threat Tokugawa Ieyasu had won the wars his struggle to control the future of Japan had just begun [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the early 17th century the ruler of Japan the Shogun was told this story [Music] one day the king of the Portuguese said to his council far to the east lies a country called Japan and it abounds in gold and silver why should not that land be added to my domains the best way to make ourselves masters of the land is by means of our religion and then send in the army the shogun tokugawa ieyasu and his legions of samurai warriors were undaunted by stories of foreign invaders he was a strong leader and had brought peace to the war-torn nation yet foreign dangers and internal unrest remained a threat as Japan deferred to the will of the Shogun eyewitnesses wrote of these remarkable times these are their memoirs of Japan's secret Empire [Music] [Applause] [Music] after we'd been in Japan five or six days came a Portugal Jesuit who reported that we were pirates we looked always that we should be set upon crosses which is the execution of this land I looked every day to die rescued from the sea and imprisoned William Adams the first Englishman in Japan had good reason for concern it was the year 1600 and Portuguese Catholics had long held a monopoly on trade in Japan at the time William Adams arrived there had been religious wars in Europe and the Catholic missionaries were not at all happy when they heard that an Englishman and an English Protestant had been washed up in Japan [Music] you [Music] the ruler demanded of me of what land I was and what moved us to come to his land being so far off I showed him the name of our country and that our land desired friendship it appeared that Ieyasu was interested in more than friendship he asked whether our country has Wars I answered him yay with the Spaniards and Portugal's he asked me diverse questions of my religion and what way we came to the country from one thing to another I abode with him you Spanish merchants but was weary of their Catholic missionaries who preached obedience to a God more powerful than he to avoid

e he considered a threat to his own authority he I also wanted his own fleet of trading ships Adams had the skills he needed [Music] the English pilot had apprenticed as a ship right [Music] Ieyasu asked him to build two ships capable of navigating the open seas I answered that I was no carpenter and had no knowledge thereof well do your endeavor saith he if it be not good it is no matter you can't deny that william adams did have certain amount of influence when he was told to build these two ships they were the first foreign ships first European ships to be built in Japan [Music] they were built with Japanese workers of course under his supervision [Music] and then afterwards they sailed to Mexico and they sailed back quite safely [Music] Ieyasu now had the leverage he desired when the Catholic missionaries continued to gain converts and create problems he expelled them life was complicated enough without these pesky foreigners interfering and sir that probably was the reason why he did not want a christine's in Japan Ieyasu replaced his Catholic interpreter with william adams who had been quick to learn Japanese he was Protestant of course he is who knew that he had no interest in helping the missionaries and so he is rather a valuable man to have around yay us who still wanted to trade with the West but on his own terms Adams convinced he AR su that the Protestants did not want to convert his people he a US who soon made him his commercial agent and Adams negotiated especially favorable terms for the growing Dutch East India Company the Hollanders be now settled and I have got them trading privileges as the Spaniards and Portugal's could never get in their 50 years in Japan [Music] Adams married and settled down into Japanese life he adopted Japanese dress and was awarded the right to wear the two swords of the samurai and he was given an estate with about 70 or 80 servants which is pretty good good far better than his standard of living in England would have been of course and I think towards the end he lost his desire to go back to England because he knew he would just be a working-class man in England we're back in Japan he has 80 servants to wait on handle foot on him [Music] it was possible that Adams visited he AR Hsu at his tea house for intimate conversation away from the politics of the court the tea ceremony was much admired by a Western observer the guests opened the gate walk along the path through the wood up to the tea house quietly contemplating everything they see they remove their fans and daggers and deposit them in a kind of cupboard place their outside for that purpose if Adams and a us who had private political discussions the tea house was also a retreat where they could replenish their souls this gathering for tea and conversation is not intended for lengthy talk but rather to contemplate within their souls with all peace and modesty the things that they see there and thus through their own efforts to understand the mysteries locked therein [Music] for Yasu unsettling foreign influences could jeopardize the peace he worked so hard to forge but the biggest challenge would be to maintain control of the 260 fiercely independent warlords and their formidable samurai armies [Music] tokugawa ieyasu became Shogun in 1603 and United Japan after generations of civil war all of the great lords had been fighting for a century they were tired of fighting they wanted to secure their own positions but as a court chronicler documented the task ahead would not be easy although he had conquered the country on horseback being a man of wisdom he fully appreciated the impossibility of governing in the country on horseback he was interested only in discovering the key to government how to govern oneself the people and the country yes Corliss man he thought was the gluttonous little what made eyassa superior as a leader was that he surrounded himself with capable people who believed in him there's a story about a low-ranking samurai who has to meet with him he also listened attentively after the man left a higher-ranking lord said to a Yasu what a waste of your time he also replied it took great courage for that man to approach me if I didn't listen he would never come again peace would not be secured by leadership alone Ieyasu had to curb the power of the daimyo the feudal lords these lords are building enormous territorial centralized domains what the feudal lords are trying to do is essentially control everything and everybody within their territories they control all the fighting men to control all the peasants they control all the resources Ieyasu allowed the daimyo to rule their own domains but he prohibited them from doing anything that might enhance their power or status relative to each other in Tokugawa Japan a daimyo was restricted to only one castle and to enlarge it he had to receive permission a new ship asked the Shogun arrange a new alliance through marriage only if the Shogun approved EI ASSA would maintain the peace through this ordered control and it extended through all levels of society [Music] the Japan that EARC fashion was built on the ancient teachings of Confucianism obey the traditions of hierarchy and respect Authority a Japan in keeping with the samurai traditions it was a rigid society with lots of rules and regulations everybody must have know their place in society and stick to it that was the theory didn't always work out in practice of course but that at least was in the theory all samurai were members of the elite class whether he be a daimyo warlord or a lowly foot soldier next in line with the farmers then the artisans at the very bottom with the tradesmen considered the parasites of society the Tokugawa Shogunate would issue many rules to control and maintain the rigid class structure from what you could eat to what you must wear lords and vassals superiors and inferiors must observe what is proper within their position in life without authorization no retainer may wear fine white damask white watered silk garments purple silk kimonos purple silk linings and kimono sleeves which bear no family crest [Music] the rules and regulations kept everyone in their place but for the daimyo at least there were still ways to earn special privileges ei also decreed that the lords must help build his castle and the surrounding city of Edo the construction became a grand competition as each daimyo bide for the Shogun's favour soon they transformed the small castle and backwater village of Edo into a magnificent domain [Music] the city later known as Tokyo the streets are far broader longer and straighter than the streets of Spain they are kept so clean that you may wouldn't think that nobody ever walks along them the emerging splendors of Edo were recorded by rodrigo de bávaro a Velasco the governor of the philippines who had been shipwrecked off the coast of japan he spent several months in the capital as a guest of the Shogun what makes this man interesting is that he wrote a report about Japan after he left Japan and he was a very discerning man he saw various aspects of Japanese life which other people had not seen the people live in particular streets according to their trade and station one Street for example is reserved for carpenters in other streets there are cobblers blacksmiths tailors and traders the novels and people of quality live in the streets and districts quite different from the rest of the town and no commoner or person of the lower classes mixes with them those daimyo who had gained most favored lived closest to the castle and were granted more audiences with the great ruler himself while Bavaria Velasco was in the castle being received in audience by Yazoo he saw a powerful daimyo come into the castle to pay homage to Ieyasu they're entered one of the greatest Nobles of Japan whose rank was evident from the gifts he brought bars of silver and gold silk robes all this was first placed on some tables but I do not believe the ruler even looked at it a hundred paces from the throne the daimyo prostrate at himself bowing his head so low that it looked as if he wanted to kiss the ground nobody said a word to him nor did he raise his eyes towards the ruler and then finally somebody clapped and the end of audience not a word had been said end of audience and he goes out backwards on his knees and Rodrigo Guevara Velasco was very much impressed by what he had seen because he realized that power Yasu head here was a powerful daimyo who had power of life and death in his own region but when he comes to pay tribute to the Shogun what a lowly position he adopts the great ruler had realized his vision all of Japan was under his control [Music] at 72 he was still remarkably vigorous then on one of his regular Hawking expeditions he fell seriously ill [Music] as he lay dying he planned the details of his funeral it would be a simple ceremony his ashes taken to the top of a mountain overlooking the land where he so often went with his hawks here he felt his spirit could soar over his beloved land holding the realm together Ieyasu had carefully forged his well-ordered society he would not leave the future of Japan to whim he called his family to his side he told his children and grandchildren who were gathered around because you are my descendants you will become Shogun as Shogun it is important that you rule the country for the benefit of the people or you will be punished by heaven as Shogun you must govern for the good of the country this world does not belong to the Tokugawa and cannot be ruled just to satisfy your whims [Music] among the family members was a young grandson destined to become Shogun the child omitsu would grow up determined to carry on in the footsteps of his famous grandfather he omitsu the third Shogun would keep Japan under Tokugawa rule using any means necessary [Music] [Music] the third Tokugawa Shogun iemitsu worshipped his late grandfather but on that day he had numerous mystical experiences that whenever he got sick Ieyasu would appear in his dream and he would wake up feeling better the next morning so his respect for EI Yasu transformed into worship [Music] the emits always carried a charm containing a piece of paper saying to live according to the way his grandfather would have lived but though he omitsu tried to emulate his grandfather his tactics were much more severe it was reported after he became Shogun he omitsu summoned the daimyo to his palace [Music] the Lord's waited all day in the cold without food or shelter they began to fear for their lives [Music] until at last they were called in to hear Mitsu's inner sanctum where he delivered his ultimatum I have been in the position of a superior and a master from my birth I shall henceforth treat all diamond as my subjects those of you who may disobey me may quickly return to your provinces repair your castles and prepare for arms I select accordingly omitsu is a fascinating children is the first Shogun who doesn't lead troops in battle he had not proved himself on the battlefield he did not have his own men who came with him into office when he became Shogun Ieyasu inherited a nation at peace yet he would rule with an iron hand he listened to whew and spared no one he would not tolerate competition not even sibling rivalry he ordered his younger brother to commit suicide [Music] the tokugawa shogunate under his rule acts much more capriciously towards lords that disobey their orders or flout any of the rules and regulations which bound them a European merchants who once tutored a omitsu observed the Shogun's Court no one dares to attempt any opposition to the will of the Shogun whatever injustice the Shogun may commit or into whatever extravagance of excesses he may plunge they praise or approve of all but ruling by fear alone could also breed revolt omitsu had to keep the daimyo Lords allegiance all 260 of them [Music] in peacetime there was no common enemy no spoils of war to reward the daimyo for their loyalty he omitsu had to find some other way to control the daimyo lords they were commanded to appear at iya Mitsu's court in Edo [Music] and they did not journey alone as witnessed by a German traveller [Music] the bodyguards embarrass put almost swaggering gait when they pass [Music] with every step they kick up their heels needed to their backsides and at the same time thrust the opposite arm forward it looks as if they're swimming in the air [Music] these elaborate processions often numbered in the thousands they were part of a system known as alternate attendance the alternate tendance system had been evolving over the decades of Tokugawa rule and primarily what it meant is that great Lords had to spend part of the year in Edo and part of the year back in their domains they had to travel back and forth according to strictly set schedules while their wives and children had to spend all their time in Oedo this was the single greatest administrative control on the outer wards during the Tokugawa Shogunate [Music] alternate attendance had another advantage for the Shogun it kept the daimyo Lords financially powerless it was reported that a daimyo could spend more than three quarters of his income maintaining the processions and supporting his army of samurai once they reached a toe what this also does by the way is cause endo to explode in size and in fact there grows up in Edo a class of samurai who only know eddo even though their domain may be in the farthest reach of Japan they're born in Oedo they work in a tow and they only know Edo for the samurai warrior life in peacetime Edo was the catalyst that changed the very nature of their existence prohibited from bringing their wives and families the samurai lived a bachelors like they were paid a small stipend to perform their official duties such as they were that's how old you must a community know they would get up in the morning and have their hair dressed by a fellow samurai then they would go to work on the grounds of the Lords estate this they would do once every four or five days the samurai would lurk only in the morning and then go home for lunch at around two o'clock in the afternoon they would go out on the town [Music] it was a life that the once-proud warrior could never have imagined IDO was becoming a city of samurai whose job description was rapidly changing from soldier to bureaucrat the life of the samurai they aren't allowed to work they're given enough money to live on and mostly what they do is they spend every day at the house of a friend drinking and talking and studying and doing tea and reading books of old war tales and imagining what it would have been like to live in the 1500s life in 17th century Japan did not include the hazards of war yet peace brought its own perils rules and regulations were strict and the penalties could be severe for any who dared disobey [Music] fluttering our papers the spring winds blow went through the open barriers how gratefully we go other five government highways led to the Shogun's capital of edo all with inspection barriers to enforce air meets ins laws [Music] the Shogun had improved the road so his messengers could quickly reach any part of Japan these roads also made it easier for the daimyo and their samurai warriors to travel to Edo [Music] but for most Japanese travel was an arduous process a multitude of rules and regulations monitored who came in and who went out of the city of Edo [Music] almost everyone needed a passport the few exceptions included itinerate performers who proved their identity by showing off their talent or sumo wrestlers whose girl was ample proof of their profession farmers will routinely denied permission to travel from village to village the government preferred to keep them working in the fields [Music] those without the proper papers often try to avoid the inspection posts by slipping by on side roads [Music] if caught there were severe penalties a traditional japanese-style punishment meant crucifixion for a man for a woman enslavement or enforced servitude [Music] with so many laws and restrictions one never knew when the Shogun's edicts might actually be enforced sir like a theater of punishment to try to scare people into behaving some ruler might decide that morals are going to hell in a handbasket and suddenly grab one person and punish them severely [Music] despite the uncertainty against all odds' travel grew in popularity now that the roads were safer more and more Japanese began to journey from village to village [Music] the most traveled road was the Tokaido which ran for 300 miles from kyoto to edo 53 rest stops dotted the highway and so these post towns along the five great roads of japan grew up to be very substantial towns themselves they had inns they had brothels they had restaurants they had places that sold in medicine there essentially grew up a post town culture people in the Tokugawa period they were driven by a curiosity people were beginning to think about Japan as a nation [Music] Travel Diaries became bestsellers you know what sue Jo was a young samurai woman writer who kept a diary as she traveled the Tokaido Road a mountain range rises above the clouds in splashing water gushes over the rocks making an ear-splitting noise on the way up we feel that we are being knocked down backwards and on the way down we feel that we are slipping all the way thus we are often fearful [Music] yNN's along the way offered welcome respite to travelers like to Joe she was on her way to eddo to serve in the residence of a high-ranking samurai [Music] although tzu joe traveled on official business accompanied by her brother she still encountered disturbing difficulties all travelers faced strict regulations but women had an especially hard time it was very difficult for women to travel in the 17th century firstly because they had to get the permission of the household who usually thought there would be better cleaning and cooking and women's travel permits were much more elaborate many checkpoints wouldn't permit women to pass because women had to have a thorough inspection of a body searched and many checkpoints didn't have female officers to come back dead body search officials were always on the lookout for women who disguised themselves as boys [Music] when SuJu arrived at the barrier station she was ordered to appear before an older woman guard a rough-looking woman examined me ran her hand through my hair and said something with a heavy accent it was very unpleasant but I had no choice I was afraid of what she might do at another post she experienced difficulties due to the wording of her permit when I presented my official document at the barrier they refused my passage because in the permit I was only identified as a woman rather than a young woman with long open sleeves [Music] I had to go back to the end I was heartbroken suja worried if she would be allowed to continue her journey [Music] it was a sleepless night as she wrote in her diary my tears darkened the light of a candle how restless I feel everything is depressing beyond description in a dawn around 4 o'clock I heard travelers gathering around and calling each other a horse neighing and the sounds of stirrups I feel envious I have spent days and nights brooding over the obstacles facing women [Music] to Joe's plight was not uncommon under Amit suzerain anybody who did not follow his rules could be punished but there was one group persecuted simply because of their beliefs the Christians [Music] [Music] the Shogun iemitsu offered rewards for the arrest of any Japanese who preached or practiced the Christian faith [Music] any informer revealing the whereabouts of the followers of priests must be rewarded accordingly if anyone reveals the whereabouts of a high-ranking priest he must be given 100 pieces of silver [Music] one has to bear in mind in this period of Japanese history that there was repression and that the Tokugawa authorities the Shogun wanted to keep Japanese society as it was and that did lead some people to believe that Christianity was subversive and was upsetting the social framework the social pattern of Japan ie amid Sue's time all foreign missionaries had been deported but the converts they left behind the Japanese Christians remained devout [Music] for many of the Japanese Christians the faith ran very very deep indeed especially in those areas where Christianity had really set down roots for three or four generations the Shogun is a great enemy to the name of Christians a European merchants observed the growing persecutions I saw 55 martyred because they would not forsake their Christian faith and amongst them there were little children of five or six years old burned in their mother's arms crying out Jesus receive their souls [Music] I would say the third Shogun omitsu I think became morbidly pathological pathologically fearful of Christianity they thought that this was a threat to our power they put out all the plugs so to speak to eradicate Christianity Christianity was said to be evil or wicked region subversive religion and so that is why they took such extreme steps to eliminate the religion despite the persecutions Christianity had struck a chord amongst many disaffected Japanese they grew defiant even willing to be martyred for their beliefs I am a Japanese and Jesuit brother I have now committed any crime but died only for having preached the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ I greatly rejoice to die for this cause for me this is a great blessing I guarantee and affirm that there is no other way to salvation except by the Christian path [Music] [Music] yeah Mitsu was increasingly disturbed by the Christian situation especially in the south where a large number lived [Music] even worse many of the Christians were former samurai now forced to work as laborers or farmers [Music] but they were Samurai in their hearts and well versed in the use of weapons for a omitsu this was unacceptable [Music] the Shogun's iron hand extended to every detail of a peasants life farmers must work in the fields from dawn to dusk wives and daughters must make meals three times a day put on red headbands and take the meals to the fields once men are home after dusk sisters-in-law and female cousins must put the chap feet of the man on the stomach of his wife and massage them [Music] if the Shogun's intolerable edicts weren't bad enough the farmers were also heavily taxed there were taxes on windows and shelves ahead tax on each newborn child and a whole tax to bury the dead the farmers were taxed in rice the currency of the day ironically farmers were not allowed to eat the rice they grew [Music] these taxes were collected by the daimyo to finance their elaborate processions to Edo and to pay the stipends which supported the samurai class [Music] the farmers were in dire straits as a Japanese writer lamented [Music] year by year the farmers grew more exhausted how could they sustain life itself under those circumstances [Music] in the Shimabara Peninsula in the far south of Japan drought and famine further depleted the meager harvest [Music] those who could not pay the taxes were punished severely in mid-december 1637 a single event ignited the long smoldering views [Music] the unde author of a farmer who owed taxes was seized and tortured furious with grief the father and his friends killed the local governor and the whole village samurai peasants and Christians rose in revolt soon the whole area was in the hands of the rebels nearly 40,000 so what began as a social upheaval as social revolt against the tremendously harsh taxation against the peasants leaving the peasants almost starving what began as that somehow developed into a Christian rebellion a European merchants reported on the rebellion a few days after the outbreak the Christians joined the farmers they cry out throughout the whole country that the time had now come to revenge the innocent blood of so many Christians and priests and that they are prepared to die for their faith the rebels swarmed into an abandoned castle surrounded on three sides by the Sea feeling protected they brought in their wives and children and barricaded themselves inside [Music] this was very upsetting the peasants were the nurse of the know the poor people they had no right to rebuild they had and not only have they rebelled and revolted but they were doing donned well militarily and so no wonder the Shogun was worried about this because this might set an example to other parts of the country that had become unsatisfied with feeling crushing taxes which the peasants were pain the Shogun didn't tolerate dissidents especially any who looked to Jesus for help he sent his troops to Shimabara to quell the rebellion but for for bloody months even as food ran out the rebels managed to hold off the government attacks [Music] the Shogun was so incensed at the continuing rebellion that he asked the Dutch to send a ship with cannons against the besieged castle the Dutch were reluctant to take part in this campaign but nevertheless they desperately want you to hold on to his toe hole which they had in trade with Japan and so if they didn't obey the order of the Shogun he might well say well okay you can pack up and go home the Shogun ordered the castles set ablaze still the rebels fought back but in the end their fate was sealed and the castle fell finally through starvation and then followed a dreadful slaughter [Music] and that was the last battle really in Jackie's history the Shimabara rebellion was the excuse the Shogun needed to finally eradicate Christianity from Japan the Shogun decided draconian measures we will cut off Japan from all Christian influence now how can you do that we will isolate Japan these foreigners of course so much trouble I suppose he was thinking they are on an unnecessary complication to our life so why not try to preserve Japanese society as is now we don't want changes the third Shogun issued laws restricting travel outside of the country on penalty of death no Japanese could leave Japan and those who were already abroad could not return to ensure his edicts were obeyed he destroyed all ships of seagoing capacity then he forbade the entry of any ship of European origin only the Dutch were allowed to stay and trade but with severe restrictions [Music] the maritime restrictions are designed to prevent any unauthorized contact with the outside world they're designed to control trade and they're designed to prevent Christian missionaries from reaching Japan and being able to proselytize and and they form the bedrock of Tokugawa foreign policy for the life of the Shogunate which is sometimes called the beginning of the isolation of Japan two years later in defiance of the Shogun's ban an official Portuguese trade delegation arrived in Japan the Shogun showed no mercy and ordered the execution of 57 of those aboard ambassadors and their crew he ordered the ship burned the few survivors were sent back with this warning a similar penalty will be suffered by all who come to these shores from Portugal whether they be ambassadors or sailors whether they come by error or driven by storm even more if the king of Portugal or even the god of the Christians were to come they would all pay the very same penalty [Music] the doors of Japan clanged shut and were not opened again to the West for 200 years [Music] the will of the Shogun had prevailed but many wondered how this isolated empire would survive in a rapidly changing world [Music] [Music] early on the morning of July 2nd 1853 a Japanese fisherman reported a strange sight I was told there were ships on fire I ran up the mountain to get a good look the ships came nearer and nearer until the Sheep of them showed us they were not Japanese ships but foreign and what we had taken for a conflagration or sea was really the black smoke rising out of their smokestacks steamships like most Western innovations were unknown in Japan now there were four in the harbor the American squadron armed with cannons and almost a thousand men was ready to force its way onto Japanese Shores [Music] Japan was a land shrouded in mystery a warrior society ruled by the powerful Tokugawa Shogunate they had successfully kept the West at bay for over 200 years but now the Western powers demanded entry could the samurai nation repel the Industrial might of a determined West these are the memoirs of Japan's secret Empire [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all those who are in contact with us are bound by an oath and signed with their blood not to talk or entrust to us information about the situation of their country their relational and secrets of government so reported the German Doktor Engel Bert Kemper one of the few Europeans allowed in Japan it was the year 1690 and the Japanese viewed Westerners as barbarians who threatened their orderly society the Japanese were determined to keep their doors closed to the west for as long as they could there was one exception a small settlement of Dutch traders who agreed to live in confinement on an island in Nagasaki Harbor for over 200 years this sequestered trading post would be europe's only window to this impenetrable land [Music] the Dutch East Indies companies sent dr. Kemper to provide medical care for the Dutch community he was also asked to gather information about the everyday life of the Japanese it would not be an easy task they are strictly and strongly guarded from the inside and the outside by various gods treating us not like honest man but like criminals traitor spies prisoners or to say the least hostages of the Shogun this jail goes by the name of Dejima the Dutch lived like prisoners on Mishima but kinfe was fascinated by the opportunity to write about something and nobody else could get access to Dejima was tiny kemper counted 236 steps across and 82 wide there were never more than 19 men allowed on the island at a time and never any Western women far from home the men did what they could to transform the unfamiliar japanese-style buildings into a little touch of Holland they placed chairs and high tables on the woven grass mats replaced futons with poster beds and insisted on being served Dutch food rather than eating Japanese no Japanese except for prostitutes were allowed unsupervised contact with the Dutch yet in order to gather information for his reports kemper managed to create a small group of inadvertent Japanese informants I served them willingly and without charge in my professional with medicines while cordially serving them European occurs I question them about local matters nature and secular and spiritual topics with total freedom [Music] the Japanese were as inquisitive as camphor the Dutch settlement was their window to the exotic world of the West but the trickle of information that arrived from overseas was carefully guarded every time he dodged ship arrived the Dutch ship would have the latest news from Europe and that news would be given to the Dutch authorities in Nagasaki and then that news would be translated into Japanese and rushed immediately to the headquarters of the Shogun the ruler of Japan the Shogun hungered for news of the outside world he commanded the Westerners to present themselves at his castle once a year the only time came from really saw Japan was when he traveled from Nagasaki to Edo which was a showman's capital [Music] the road trip to eddo gave Kemp for revealing glimpses into the world of the Japanese he recorded every detail of his month-long trip [Music] we receive many of the honors that are generally shown to the provincial laws the roads are swept with booths and water to keep the dust down in the houses bordering the road people kneel behind the blinds watching our procession in profound silence [Music] an incredible number of people daily used highways of Japan's provinces indeed at certain times of the year they are as crowded as the streets of a populous European city the reason for these crowds is partly that the Japanese travelled more often than other people Kemper would write about all of the travellers samurai and their Lords called daimyo merchants and roadside performers Buddhist monks and a group of young women who dressed like nuns they cover their Shan heads for silk coats and a dogs themselves nicely each attaches herself to one particular traveler starts up a rustic tune and as long as it's to her advantage she accompanies and amuses him for several hours as the road traffic grew so did the number of merchants who catered to the travelers needs [Music] these are many fine stalls those of merchants and cloth dealers medicine dealers traders and idols booksellers glass blowers pharmacists and people crying out there there's the countless humble Inns roadside food stalls sake or beer taverns cake and sweet stores along our roads outside tables also have a variety of biscuits of different colors and shapes of display that are pretty to look at but are generally so tough that it is difficult to move on teeth if one attempts to chew them tradesman once considered social parasites were beginning to improve their position in Japanese society successful street peddlers became roadside merchants who would eventually build bigger stores and even move to the cities Kemper was witnessing a changing way of life in Japan that would soon shake the very foundations of this highly ordered society the samurai weren't allowed to engage in trade so the merchants standard of living was rising but that of the samurai was falling and that was just not appropriate for Tokugawa society brothers samurai were the top class the samurai were the elite ruling class less than 10% of the population in Tokugawa Japan one was born a samurai and only a samurai had the right to carry two swords obligation and loyalty to one's daimyo Master formed the basis of their warrior code [Applause] but now in an era of peace the once privileged samurai faced an uncertain future there were no Wars to fight and many daimyo found it difficult to keep a full army on staff while higher-level samurai could find work as civil servants other samurai were not allowed to work in occupations considered beneath their class an increasing number of unemployed samurai called droning wandered the countryside looking for a new master [Music] the search for new opportunities led many to the cities and there was no more rapidly growing city than Edo later to be known as Tokyo Edda was the capital of the Tokugawa Shogunate and dr. Kemper is destined ation here he would finally come face-to-face with the Shogun the most powerful person in Japan [Music] [Music] when dr. Kemper arrived in eddo he was sequestered in guarded quarters for two weeks [Music] finally he was summoned to appear at the castle of the fifth shogun tokugawa Tsuyoshi the Shogun's residence is spacious with many long corridors and large rooms which can be closed off by sliding partitions according to the finest design of Japanese traditions the ceilings beams and pillars patterned by nature covered with lacquer or carved and gilded artistically into patterns of birds and foliage the important thing about the fifth Tokugawa Shogun soon a Yoshi was that he was a first shogun who was not educated as a samurai he was educated as scholar because he was never supposed to become Shogun and so he had a quite a different view of the world the Shogun's mother was a merchant's daughter she broke class barriers when she caught the eye of the reigning Shogun her son soon io she carried within him both samurai and merchant values he would preside over a new direction in Japanese society [Music] at his court scholarship rather than martial prowess was the fashion and daimyo Lords who wish to curry favor with him became patrons of the Arts and Letters it was a time of cultural flowering in Japan so now Yoshi changed samurais society he condemned violence which of course was part of the samurai ethic influenced by his childhood study of Buddhism and the Confucian classics the Shogun's laws of compassion were intended to protect all of nature's creatures soon airships laws of compassion protected those at the bottom of the social scale he had laws against infanticide and that is quite advanced children were abandoned when parents couldn't no longer feed them they were simply left to die but sooner Yoshi ordered that from now on officials had to take care of them feed them and find homes for them but soon aiyo she was also known for lavishing the National Treasury on his own pleasures and he began to pursue his reforms too harsh and unpopular extremes born in the year of the dog soon aiyo she issued strict laws protecting dogs the samurai kept large number of dogs in their mansions and those who were not wanted were let go and roamed the city and often attacked children nobody wanted to be responsible for dog but he of course could not order that these dogs be killed he ended up building dog pants and apparently they were eventually some 40,"000 dogs which were fed in dog pants and of course the feudal lords are damned you had to pay for that soon aiyo she would become known as the dog shogun dr. Kemper observed with humour when dogs die they are carried up the mountains and buried known as carefully than people a certain farmer laborious Lee carrying his dead dog up the hill complained to his neighbor about the year of the birth of the shoberg the other replied my friend let us not complain if he was born in the year of the horse our Lord would be in much heavier it was the dog Shogun who dr. Kemper was finally summoned to meet after a month-long trip and two weeks of waiting Kemper was so impressed with the experience he drew sketches to illustrate his account of the command performance after he had been drilled for two hours he ordered us to take off our clothes to dance to jump to play the drunkard to speak broken Japanese to sing at the demand of the Shogun he had to put up with providing such amusements and performed innumerable other monetary elaborate camphor and the fifth Shogun shared one thing and that was a great curiosity but at the audience a Shogun sat behind the bamboo screen and he asked m4 to come close to the bamboo screen even take his wig off and dance and sing for him and came first strained his eyes to be able to see what the Shogun looked like and his wife's behind the bamboo screen but they never were able to talk to each other directly the Shogun and the doctor would meet only three times but each provided a brief glimpse for the other into his world Kim first account of Japan became a best-seller it first appeared in English then it was translated into Dutch French several translations even Russian and basically all knowledge until the 20th century was based on Kim first so-called history of Japan Japan had no desire to open its doors to the west the country was at peace but the economy was in decline thousands of disenfranchised samurai warriors would keep the nation on edge [Music] by the beginning of the 18th century Edo was probably the largest city in the world with over a million people unlike the European capitals its citizens enjoyed a safe clean city with an advanced recycling program [Music] and it was prosperous beyond measure copper coins flow like currents of water while silver piles up like drifting snow every morning fish are sold in such quantities that one may well wonder whether or not the supply in the seas has been exhausted visible in the distance he is Mount Fuji rising in all its magnificence against the horizon at least half of Etta's population were Samurai Warriors who had come to the capital with their daimyo Lords since there were no Wars to fight the samurai had leisure time but not always the means to enjoy it the downside of the era of peace force amadai was that the somewhat I weren't allowed to engage in commerce and therefore gradually they see a lot of wealthy merchants more able to do all of the things that they want to do because they have more money than your common solid I ironically merchants who catered to the needs of the samurai were the ones who benefited they could now afford to get education developed their tastes cultural taste and emulate the high-class samurai whom these merchants always admired and envied the social barrier was breaking down since the beginning of the Tokugawa era a restrictive class structure had kept everyone in their place although the classes were not supposed to fraternize the rules began to bend michio taking y'know haiku at school in social situations such as the popular haiku clubs where both samurai and merchants were both active participants rather than addressing each other by their acknowledged family names each would create a pen name in this way they freed themselves from adhering to the rigid rules demanded by their social standing [Music] encouraged by peace and a prosperous economy the arts and entertainment flourished samurai interest in education had encouraged literacy among all social groups eighty-five percent of the male population of Edo were avid readers in 1800 there about 120 or more haiku poetry circles and also there about 500 bookstores and very active publishing activities the people demanded these books and information they want to read exciting fictions some of the bestselling novels of the day were written by a merchant turned author named a Hara psychic ooh his book celebrated the eras emerging pop culture a totally new genre in Japanese fiction psychic who haunted the streets of Edo for his literary material he knew prostitutes and daimyo as well as beggars and merchants and he wrote about them all with unabashed candor and rippled humor especially the newly prosperous merchants who tried to emulate the refined samurai [Music] if you didn't know better you'd think they all came from fine families but let me tell you that one in a shiny coat he's a glue maker he deals in cattle bones and cow slobber but the way he dresses you think his own bones were the product of fine breeding he's had to put his house in hock his creditors have taken him to court if you ask me he's crazy to be out for a night on the town in Edo a night on the town often meant kabuki the most popular form of stage entertainment comma to enter people the kabuki actors were like Hollywood stars the fans would collect woodblock prints of their favorite actors not only for the fun of collecting them but also to see what fantastic costumes their favorite actors were wearing on stage if the fans really liked a certain style or design in a flash it would become the newest fashion trend the kabuki plays were romantic heroic tales one of the most famous tution Gura was based on a notorious real-life event a daimyo Lord had been humiliated in a confrontation with a court official the ruling Shogun had ordered the Lord to commit seppuku ceremonial suicide outraged by his death 47 of the Lord's samurai warriors avenged his honor by killing the official [Music] this presented the ruling Shogun with a dilemma the samurai had obeyed their code of honor yet they had challenged the Shogun's authority the peoples begged for clemency but the Shogun would not yield he ordered the samurai to commit suicide these samurai had lived and died by their own code of honor [Music] the incident captured the public's attention like no other soon these men were immortalized on the Kabuki stage a nostalgic tribute to a bygone era it represented for them the ideal that Psalm and I were so selfless and devoted to honor and to their Lord that they would give up their lives and this was reassuring to them in a messy commercial istic world in which muslim and i spent their time drinking and partying and watching the theatre and being selfish like us here their 47 samurai really act like warriors all raise a shout of acclaim well done well done and this praise will be echoed through ages to come for these loyal retainers we have recorded here their glory ever renewed like the leaves of the bamboo the honor of the samurai would live on in myth and legend but in Tokugawa Japan there were no wars no more quests for eternal glory in real life the samurai would have to find another outlet for their passion [Music] [Music] the courtesan arranges her clothing so that the red silk undergarment will flip open to reveal a flash of white skin when men witnessed such a sight they go insane and spend the money they are entrusted with even if it means literally losing their heads the next day but most men only gape envious of the men who can pay the courtesans price [Music] more than three thousand courtesans and geisha plied their trade in Yoshiwara the pleasure district of Edo Yoshiwara was government regulated an effective tool for keeping the restless male population under careful control like soldiers on perpetual leave the samurai often spent their idle hours and squandered their meager stipends on its seductive illusions Yoshiwara was a dreamland for Edo man it gave them fantasy imagination and romance it was like a Hollywood where celebrity was so important gated walled and surrounded by a moat it was a city unto itself [Music] no Westerner was ever allowed to explore its pleasures there was a distinct difference between the Geisha and courtesans geisha were professional entertainers they did not rely on sex for entertaining men they had their music their singing playing musical instruments and dancing whereas the courtesans entertain the clients with a conversation and sexual gratification Yoshiwara courtesans were the elite of the prostitutes if they just wanted to fulfill their sexual need all of our eddo there were plenty of illegal cheap prostitutes but they wanted to come to Yoshiwara because it was such a prestigious and special place recruited at a young age from impoverished families both geishas and courtesans were schooled in fastidious etiquette and endowed with a magnificent sense of style and artistic refinement their ability to hold a conversation about the latest play or City scandal was as important as what came afterwards the courtesans and their clients gathered in neighbouring tea houses they were stylish centres of elegance and wit much like the London coffee houses of the same period to properly partake of Yoshi Juarez delights was an art in itself [Music] and the Yoshiwara courtesans were trained to think that they were better than their clients and if a man wanted to visit the Oshiwara he had to prepare for it six months in prior he had to buy a farm set of sword he had to think about what to wear because he wouldn't just go there the courtesan had the right to turn them how client if she didn't like him even if he could afford to pay for therefore he wanted to make a good impression on the cortisone and then once he's committed to her he had no right to see other women and if he on the sly went to see any other person the courtesans entourage had every right to punish him his hair I would cut off he will be made to wear women's red kimono and he will be taunted by a woman Yoshiwara nurtured its own unique customs art fashion and language it was a world seemingly set adrift from the harsh realities of life living only for the moment leaving all our time to the pleasures of the moon a snow cherry blossoms and maple leaves singing songs drinking sake caressing each other just drifting drifting never give a care if we had no money refusing to be disheartened like a gourd floating along the river current this is what is called ukyo the floating world but the world ochio still retained its ballistics and so this transitory life it's in its impermanence this life's suffering was still there particularly for the courtesans and prostitutes all of whom had some kind of trouble they were very unhappy and yet they had to present a very brilliant gay external appearance to the general public it makes me think of the music of Blues in jazz world this in definable indescribable pace of sadness and languid Ness this is very reminiscent of the world would kill to me for the samurai who frequented Yoshiwara times were changing they continued to train daily for battle but without a war to fight many became aimless today's warriors all they talk about is women eating and drinking actors and dramatic productions their fencing practice and Lance work are only for personal vendetta their study of archery and gunnery are solely for show they're writing just for ceremonies [Music] katsu kokichi was a mid-level Samurai drawn to Yoshiwara but without the income to fulfill his desires I was 21 and penniless I had no choice but to sell my everyday sword I had only the clothes on my back to take my mind off my woes I went to the Yoshiwara they are protesting youngsters that did not fit into the society wearing oversized kimonos with interesting hairstyle sometime skinhead as a wave protest many of these young men unemployed and desperate like katsu Kokichi lived on the edge of society often falling into debt theft and gangsterism when we enter the shrine proceed a couple of sharp looking characters sauntered at us humming a tune without warning my body spat in the face of one of the men we then noticed a group of about twenty men all armed with long hooked Spears outside the gates was a reinforcement of some thirty men with pike bonus we were four against fifty four katsu Kokichi the samurai code of honor was all but gone by the middle of the 18th century the expensive delights of Yoshiwara were no longer affordable for most samurai the pleasure district took on an increasingly ugly edge and brothel keepers lost their pride they had become slaves of money-making and they became much less compassionate some of them became very very cool and treated prostitutes miserably and there was some death toward the end of the period the sick of prostitutes were not given medication or care and when they died they were just thrown into a pit for nameless dead body never feeling alone just like floating weeds cut off at the root I may just follow where the water may take me the insular world of the samurai was in decay to find a cure for its ills some would begin to look in an unlikely direction the West now beckoned with new ideas and hope [Music] I couldn't read a word of course but drawings of the viscera bones and muscles were quite unlike anything I had previously seen physician sugita Jen PACU couldn't read Dutch but when he stumbled upon a Dutch anatomy book he was stunned by the drawings he had never seen anything like it in his Chinese medical books in the mid 18th century Western books first brought clandestinely from the Netherlands piqued the interest of many Japanese scientists and doctors muscle did Monday I'm open I did not got that sugita again Haku received permission from the government to order the first sanctioned autopsy of a criminal's corpse or scientific study the corpse of the criminal was that of an old woman of about fifty years the old butcher pointed to this send that giving them names but there were certain parts for which he had no names when we compared what we saw with the illustrations in the Dutch book it was exactly as depicted [Music] dr. su kita and his friends reflected on how shameful it was that they had tried to treat their patients without a true knowledge of the human body he bowed to learn more he taught himself Dutch so he could translate the book the next day we met and began gradually we got so we could decipher ten lines or more a day after two or three years of hard study everything became clear to us the joy of it was as the chewing of sweet sugarcane in 1774 the Shogun granted dr. sugita permission to publish the medical book so he could share his knowledge with other doctors this book became part of a growing interest in Dutch learning known as Ron Kaku now aku or the snake originally Rangga coo had to do with medical studies when physicians discovered they could heal ailments with the new Western medicine from Holland that they couldn't heal with the traditional Japanese medical practices they became very interested in the study of Rangga KU gradually as knowledge of the Dutch language became more widespread other aspects of Rangga KU such as astronomy science and chemistry were introduced to Japan [Music] almost a hundred years after dr. Engelbert Kemper the desire for Western knowledge would initiate the push to open the door to Japan from the inside [Music] and yet as attractive as Western knowledge was to some Japanese intellectuals there were others who believe that anything Western still threatened Japanese society one source of harm that has a period of late is Dutch studies these students have been taken in by the weakness of some for novel gadgets and rare medicines which delight the eye and enthrall the heart there's some day the treacherous foreigners should take advantage of the situation and lower ignorant people to his ways our people will adopt such practices as eating dogs and sheep and no one will be able to stop it it is like nurturing barbarians within our own country [Music] today the alien barbarians of the West the lowly organs of the legs and feet of the world are dashing across the seas tramp in other countries underfoot and daring with their squinting eyes and limping feet to override the noble Nations what manner of arrogance is this Japan had managed to keep the alien barbarians at bay for more than 200 years but now in the mid 19th century the West was poised to assert itself the Shogun is faced with a strategic threat on three fronts from the north the Russians are coming from the south the British are coming and ultimately from the east the Americans come the new country of the United States of America was on the move [Music] Japan was known to have large coal deposits and something else in abundance whales whale oil which literally greased the wheels of American industry was a multi-million dollar business whale hunters had depleted the North Atlantic oceans now America looked eastward to Japan if that double-bolted land Japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whale ship balloon tomb the credit will be due so rote Herman Melville in his classic tale of the great white whale that haunted the waters off Japan by the time Moby Dick was published in 1851 the United States was ready to assert its power Japan's leaders were aware of the growing push towards their Shores the Shogunate had been preparing for the arrival of the West for decades they had set up a special translation Bureau which was gathering information about the West translating atlases translating dictionaries developing a set of foreign affairs specialists key advisors warned of an imminent foreign threat they urged the Shogun to bolster his defenses we should build warships then if barbarians come to our sea we should shoot every single one of them others feared that Japan could not serve as a worthy opponent to the West their weaponry and ships had not changed since closing the doors to Europe 200 years before there was no resolution [Music] then early in the morning on July 2nd 1853 a local fisherman reported this strange sight I was told there were ships on fire I ran up to the mountain to get a good look the ships came nearer and nearer until the shape of them showed us they were not Japanese ships but foreign and what we had taken for a conflagration or sea was really the black smoke rising out of their smokestacks these steamships dwarfed any ship ever built in Japan to the Japanese they were the coot of who named the black ships of evil appearance on board were some sixty cannons and almost one thousand Americans and they landed not in the foreigners port of Nagasaki but rather in the forbidden waters of Edo Bay the Shogun's own capital city upon hearing the news the Shogun immediately fell ill many said from the shock of hearing that a foreign naval squadron was at his doorstep his advisors tried to deal with the crisis [Music] fresh messages arrived one after the other the situation seemed so suddenly so formidable and so important orders were issued to the great clans to keep strict watch as if it were possible that these barbarian vessels might proceed to acts of violence in a desperate show of force the Shogun had sent a squadron of guard boats to surround the American ships the Japanese officer ordered the ships to leave the commander Commodore Matthew C Perry ignored him I was well aware that the more exclusive I should make myself from the more exacting I might be the more respect to these people of forms and ceremonies would award me five thousand samurai warriors armed with swords and antiquated cannons lined the shores again their chief officer commanded parry leave at obey immediately the Commodore refused i endeavor to inculcate the idea that the government of the united states is superior in power and influence to japan the honor of the nation calls for it and the interest of Commerce demands it [Music] the Japanese on shore watched as Perry's crews readied for action cannons were loaded guns were drawn Perry came ashore Perry presented his papers and delivered his ultimatum he would be back and he expected Japan to comply with America's demand to open the country for trade if not he was prepared to take Japan by force he would return in the spring for his answer [Music] then he and his squadron left a tobei their deportment and manner of expressions were exceedingly arrogant and the resulting insult to our national dignity was not small those who heard could but gnash their teeth and suffer this insult in silence after the barbarians had retired a certain person drew his sword and slashed to bits a portrait of their leader Harry there was great fear of Perry there were the the portraits of Perry as a devil there were the portraits of his ships belching fire all of this served to to whip up you know near hysteria on the part of of portions of the Japanese populace at the same time there's fascination there's fascination with Perry there's fascination with these ships these enormous ships that hadn't been seen before there's fascination with the technological prowess of the Americans to complicate matters the Shogun had died and the new Shogun was mentally unfit his advisors took charge but they could not reach agreement the head of the Shogunate decides that he is going to pull all of the daimyo in Japan what should the Shogunate do this is a radical break with tradition the the authority of the Shogunate is to deal with Foreign Relations the title of the Shogun of course is the great barbarian quelling Generalissimo and yet here is the head of the Shogunate asking the daimyo what he should do two positions are staked out one being known as the open the country argument the Americans do not understand the ethics of humanity and justice there will be no choice but to start trade with them the other side being Revere the Emperor and expelled the Barbarian the Americans have come to seize Japan therefore if we don't drive them away now the other foreign powers will follow we are in a dangerous situation [Music] while the debate raged the Shogunate remained indecisive the end of the year was filled with half-hearted compromises and inadequate attempts at coastal defense [Music] then in February Perry returned earlier than expected this time his show of force was even more ominous he arrived with double the ships and crew the honor of the Japanese had been challenged but they had no means to defend it their only hope lay in negotiation [Music] as soon as Perry came ashore the talks began they went on into the night and for the next 23 days in the end the Treaty was a compromise which served both countries interests [Music] Harry got what he wanted which was to establish a relationship between Japan and the United States the Shogunate got what it wanted in not surrendering its control over Foreign Relations and opening Japan up to unregulated trade

MARK: HELLO, AMERICA. I\'M MARK LEVIN. THIS IS ""LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN."" WELCOME. >> NICE TO SEE YOU. >> IT\'S A GREAT HONOR TO SEE YOU, PATRICK MICHAELS. DOCTOR. EXPERT ON ALL THINGS CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT AS FAR AS I\'M CONCERNED. LITTLE BIT OF YOUR BACKGROUND. DIRECTOR OF THE STUDY OF SCIENCE AT THE CATO INSTITUTE. YOU HOLD AN AB IN SM, YOU HOLD THOSE DEGREES IN BIOLOGY, SCIENCES AND PLANT ECOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. PRETTY GOOD SCHOOL. Ph.D. IN ECOLOGICAL CLIMATOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN IN MADISON, 1979. PRESIDENT OF THE STATE CLIMATOLOGISTS, PROGRAM CHAIRMAN FOR THE CITY OF APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY OF THE AMERICAN METEORLOGICAL SOCIETY. SAY THAT FAST FIVE TIMES. RESEARCH PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FOR 30 YEARS, AND GIVING EXPANSIVE BACKGROUND THAT YOU HAVE, GIVING THAT TO THE PUBLIC SO THEY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU\'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU\'RE A CONTRIBUTING AUTHOR AND REVIEWER OF THE UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL PANEL OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE\'VE HEARD IT ALL. WHAT\'S GOING ON OUT THERE? >> WELL, SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE PLANET IS WARMER THAN IT WAS 100 YEARS AGO ABOUT. 9/10th OF A DEGREE CELSIUS. MARK: 9/10th DEGREE OF CELSIUS IS THAT A LOT? >> NO. COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVEN\'T PUT ENOUGH CO2 IN THE AIR, AND ONE IN THE LATER PART OF THE 20th CENTURY THAT SLOWS DOWN OR DEPENDS WHOSE DATA YOU USE ONLY TO RESUME WITH THE BIG EL NINO THAT COVERED THE NEWS THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THAT MEANS THAT PROBABLY HALF, MAYBE HALF OF THAT NINE-TENTHS OF THE DEGREE MIGHT BE CAUSED BY GREENHOUSE GASES. WHEN THE PLANET WARMED BEGINNING 1976, THE TEMPERATURE OF THE STRATOSPHERE STARTED TO STOP, THAT\'S THE PREDICTION OF GREENHOUSE THEORY THAT\'S NOT INTUITIVE. THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER OF SCIENCE CARL POPPER SAID IF YOU CAN MEET A DIFFICULT PREDICTION WITH YOUR THEORY, YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENTERTAIN YOUR THEORY. SO THE THEORY IS RIGHT, BUT THE APPLICATION OF IT IS WRONG. IT IS NOWHERE NEAR AS WARM AS IT\'S SUPPOSED TO BE. THE COMPUTER MODELS ARE MAKING SYSTEMATIC, DRAMATIC ERRORS OVER THE ENTIRE TROPICS WHICH IS 40% OF THE EARTH, AND IT\'S WHERE ALL OUR MOISTURE COMES FROM. ALMOST ALL OF IT. MARK: LET ME STOP YOU THERE. WHO DOES THESE COMPUTER MODELS? >> GOVERNMENTS. THERE ARE 32 FAMILIES OF COMPUTER MODELS THAT ARE USED BY THE UNITED NATIONS. EACH GOVERNMENT SPONSORED. AND ALL OF THEM ARE PREDICTING FAR, FAR TOO MUCH WARMING. THE DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT\'S BEEN PREDICTED TO HAPPEN, WHICH LOOKS LIKE SDMSHGS WHAT IS HAPPENING CONTINUES TO GROW. MARK: WE KNOW THAT FOR A FACT? >> YEAH, YOU COULD JUST LOOK AT THE WEATHER BALLOON TEMPERATURES. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SATELLITE TEMPERATURES. YOU CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED THE REANALYSIS DATA. THEY BEHAVE IN CONCERT. THEY\'RE SHOWING THE SAME THING, AND THE SAME THING IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THIS THING. HOWEVER, WE NEED TO CALL THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. MARK: SPECIAL COUNSEL? >> YES, BECAUSE ONE MODEL WORKS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? IT\'S THE RUSSIAN MODEL. MARK: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SO ALL THE GOVERNMENT MODELS ARE LIKE THIS? >> YEAH. MARK: THE RUSSIAN MODEL LIKE THIS. >> YEAH. THE RUSSIAN MODEL HAS THE LEAST WARMING IN IT. MARK: THE RUSSIAN MODEL HAS THE LEAST WARMING AND PRETTY MUCH FOLLOWS REALITY. WHAT\'S BEEN TESTED OVER A FEW DECADES. >> YEAH, CORRECT. IF WE WERE RATIONAL ABOUT THIS, THINK ABOUT THE DAILY WEATHER FORECAST. YOU WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL, THEY GO THIS MODEL SAYS THAT, THAT MODEL SAYS THAT, WE THINK THIS ONE IS WORKING THE BEST, WE\'RE GOING TO RELY ON THAT. WELL, FOR CLIMATE FORECAST SHOULD BE USING THE RUSSIAN MODEL BUT WE\'RE NOT. WE USE THIS BIG SPATE OF ALL THE OTHER MODELS THAT HAVE THE WARMING THAT\'S NOT OCCURRING. MARK: WHY ARE THE OTHER MODELS, 31 OF THEM, WRONG. AND WHY DO THEY ALL GO THE SAME DIRECTION, UP? >> BECAUSE, THEY WHAT ARE IS CALLED PARAMETERIZED. THEY\'RE ALL PARAMETERIZED, CAN I TRANSLATE PARAMETERIZED IN ENGLISH? FUDGE. THEY DON\'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER, DON\'T KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR CERTAIN PHENOMENA, SO WE ESSENTIALLY PUT IN CODE STEPS THAT GIVE US WHAT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE. AND SYSTEMATIC ERROR THAT WAS MADE WAS THE MODELS WERE TUNED, AS IT SAID. TUNED. TUNED TO SIMULATE THE WARMING OF THE EARLY 20th CENTURY. BEGAN IN 1910, ENDED IN 1945, ABOUT .45 DEGREES CELSIUS. MARK, THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY CARBON DIOXIDE. MARK: BECAUSE THERE WASN\'T ENOUGH. >> WE HAD TO PUT ENOUGH IN THAT THE BACKGROUND CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION IS 280 MILLION PARTS PER MILLION. WHEN THE FIRST WARMING STARTED, 208 PARTS PER MILLION. IF IT IS THAT SENSITIVE TO 18PPM CHANGE IN CO2 WE WOULDN\'T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW AND WE\'D BE SWEATING BULLETS. >> SO WHAT YOU\'RE SAYING IS MAN MADE CARBON DIOXIDE THE LAST CENTURY COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED -- >> EARLY 20th CENTURY. MARK: COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED THIS HEAT. SO WHAT DID? DO WE KNOW? >> NO. AND THREE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS IN LIFE MAY NOT BE I LOVE YOU. IT MAY BE I DON\'T KNOW. I DON\'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT KICKED OFF THAT WARMING. THERE\'S LOTS OF THEORIES. ONE IS THAT IT WAS THE FINAL ESCAPE FROM A GOLD PERIOD, MULTICENTURY PERIOD KNOWN AS THE LITTLE ICE AGE. THAT\'S THE PLAUSIBILITY, WHY DID IT HAPPEN THEN. BUT WE DON\'T HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THAT. BECAUSE WE FORCED THE COMPUTER MODELS TO SAY, HUMAN INFLUENCE, CO2 AND OTHER STUFF. WE MADE THE MODELS TOO SENSITIVE, AND SO THAT\'S WHY WHEN YOU GET TO THE LATE 20th CENTURY, ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY\'RE WARMING UP LIKE CRAZY AND THE REALITY IS DOWN HERE. IT WAS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN. THIS WAS REVEALED IN SCIENCE MAGAZINE IN LATE 2016, AND THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED BY A FRENCH CLIMATE MODELER CALLED THE ART AND SCIENCE OF CLIMATE MODEL TUNING. AND IN IT, HE SPEAKS OF PARAMETERIZING. WE COULD SAY FUDGING, THE MODELS TO GIVE, HIS WORDS, AN ANTICIPATED ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF RESULTS. SO IT\'S THE SCIENTIST, NOT THE SCIENCE THAT\'S DETERMINING HOW MUCH IT\'S GOING TO WARM. LOT OF PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW THIS, BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE, AND YOU KNOW, WE COULD SPECULATE AS TO WHY THAT PAPER WAS PUBLISHED RIGHT BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION? I WOULDN\'T WANT TO IMPUTE CAUSATION, BUT GEE -- MARK: BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT CAUSATION. >> SURE. MARK: HAVE YOU 31 GOVERNMENTS. >> THE 31 DIFFERENT MODELS. >> 31 DIFFERENT MODELS. MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTS. >> RIGHT. MARK: FUDGING THE NUMBERS? >> NOT FUDGING THEM PARAMETERIZING. MARK: YOU USED THE WORD FUDGING. DOES OUR EPA DO THAT? DOES NASA DO THAT? WHO DOES THAT FOR US? >> GOOD QUESTION, MARK, BECAUSE THE EPA WAS TOLD BY THE SUPREME COURT IN 2007 THAT IF IT FOUND THE CARBON DIOXIDE ENDANGERED HUMAN HEALTH AND WELFARE, THAT IT HAD THE POWER TO REGULATE IT UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. MARK: THIS IS THE MASSACHUSETTS. >> THE EPA. WELL, THEY PRODUCED AN ENDANGERMENT FINDING, 2009, AND THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR PROSPECTIVE CLIMATE IS 100%, I DIDN\'T SAY 90%. I SAID 100% BASED ON THOSE MODELS. SO IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THOSE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY ARE NOT WORKING, YOU CAN TAKE DOWN THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING, AND THAT WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR ALL THOSE POLICIES THAT CAME OUT OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. MARK: WHICH WOULD MEAN YOU DON\'T GET TO REGULATE -- >> ABSOLUTELY. MARK: -- CARBON DIOXIDE. >> ABSOLUTELY, THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING IS THE HEART OF THE MATTER. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW GUNG HO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS ON THIS ISSUE. IF YOU LISTEN TO HIS FIRST INAUGURAL SPEECH, JANUARY 20, 2009, IT\'S SECOND SUBSTANTIVE PARAGRAPH OF THE SPEECH IS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, AFTER HEALTH CARE. 90 DAYS AFTER HE FINISHED THAT SPEECH, HIS EPA PRODUCED A PRELIMINARY FINDING OF ENDANGERMENT FROM CARBON DIOXIDE. THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT, BUREAUCRATS CAN\'T WORK THAT FAST, AND THEN THE FINAL FINDING WAS MADE IN DECEMBER FOR THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN COPENHAGEN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE ANOTHER GLOBAL WARMING. MARK: SO YOU\'RE TELLING US THAT WE HAVE A MASSIVE BIT OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT HAS ENORMOUS EFFECT ON SOCIETY THAT\'S BUILT ON -- I\'LL USE MY WORDS, PHONY MODELS. >> BUILT ON A HOUSE OF CARDS. MODELS REALLY DON\'T WORK. IF I COULD REALLY BE ARCANE, I COULD EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM AS TO WHY THEY DON\'T WORK. MARK: AS LONG AS I UNDERSTAND IT. >> THE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY PREDICT THAT AS YOU GO UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE TROPICS WHICH ARE 40% OF THE EARTH THAT THE TEMPERATURE SHOULD RISE DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO FURTHER UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE LEVEL OF THE JET STREAM, THE COMPUTER MODELS ARE PREDICTING SEVEN TIMES. I DIDN\'T SAY SEVEN-TENTHS OF A DEGREE, I SAID SEVEN TIMES MORE WARMING THAN BEING OBSERVED. WHY AM I BORING YOU WITH THAT? THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE DETERMINES PRECIPITATION, AND GUESS WHAT? ALMOST ALL THE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE THAT WE HAVE AROUND US TODAY IN THE HUMID WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT COMES FROM THE TROPICS. SO IF YOU GET THAT VERTICAL MOTION WRONG, DOWN THERE, YOU GET ALL THE SUBSEQUENT VARIABLES WRONG. IT\'S A FANTASTIC SYSTEMATIC ERROR, AND AGAIN, THAT ALONG WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE RATHER THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES THAN WHAT\'S BEING OBSERVED, THAT\'S SUFFICIENT TO THE CHEMICAL FINDING. MARK: TO THE AVERAGE PEDESTRIAN LIKE ME, IF YOU GET THAT WRONG, WHAT DOES IT MEAN? YOU GET THE WEATHER MODELS WRONG? >> THE SUBSEQUENT WEATHER WRONG. THAT\'S WHY, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE FAMILIES OF MODELS, THEY PREDICT RADICALLY DIFFERENT CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION FROM MODEL TO MODEL. WELL, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY GOT THE PRECIPITATION INITIALIZATION OUT OF TROPICS WRONG. PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT. I OFFER YOU WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA, IF AN EXAMPLE PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT COMING FROM THE TROPICS, GET THAT WRONG AND YOU GET THAT THING. >> IS WEATHER GETTING WORSE? >> NO. I LOVE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT. ROGER PILKE, JR., AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DOES. THIS YES, THERE\'S MORE DAMAGE FROM WEATHER BECAUSE THERE\'S MORE STUFF AND PEOPLE AND PROPERTY IN THE WAY OF WEATHER. SO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT ARE WEATHER DAMAGES AS A PERCENT OF GDP. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, THERE\'S NOTHING WHATSOEVER. I\'M SURE HURRICANES ARE GETTING WORSE. I HEARD THAT ON EVERY LEGACY NETWORK DURING FLORENCE AND HARVEY AND ALL THAT STUFF. WELL, FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE\'S A GUY BY THE NAME OF RYAN MAUI, A HOT SHOT YOUNG TROPICAL METEOROLOGIST, AND A SCHOLAR AT THE CATO INSTITUTE. HE TRACKS THE ENERGY IN THE TROPICAL CYCLONES. SINCE WE GOT GLOBAL RECORDS THAT BEGAN IN 1970, AND YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT INTEGRATED ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING AFTER ALL, IT\'S ONLY LOGICAL. VICE PRESIDENT GORE SAYS THAT MUST BE THE CASE. IT\'S NOT. THERE\'S NO RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE ACCUMULATED CYCLONE ENERGY AND THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH. IT\'S JUST NOT THERE. NOW, WHAT -- WAIT A MINUTE, J DOES OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THIS? THEY SAID IT IN THEIR LAST REPORT CALLED GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY SAID, OH, THERE\'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HURRICANE POWER IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN FROM 1970 TO 2009 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 1980 TO 2009. WAIT A MINUTE. WHY DID YOU STOP IN 2009. IT\'S 2014 REPORT. BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE DATA AFTER 2009, THE INCREASE GOES BACK TO WHERE IT WAS. WHY DID YOU START IN THE MID 1970s, BECAUSE WE HAVE RECORDS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD BACK TO 1920. IF YOU LOOK AT 1920 TO 1950, YOU SEE AN INCREASE THAT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT OCCURS. MARK: SO THE INFORMATION THEY\'RE PROVIDING US -- >> IS SKEWED. IT\'S SKEWED. THEY\'RE CHERRY PICKING. MARK: HERE WE RELY ON THE CLIMATOLOGISTS AND THEY ARE HYPERPOLITICAL. TONIGHT GET BACK TO THAT AS SOON AS WE RETURN. >>> DON\'T FORGET, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU CAN WATCH LEVIN TV ALMOST EVERY WEEK NIGHT BY']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69,0,"Global National: May 5, 2020 | Case in France raises new questions about COVID-19 timeline","On today's episode of Global National, new evidence suggests France's first COVID-19 case was earlier than previously though. Redmond Shannon explains why this new finding may be integral to understanding the virus's spread.In Canada, New Brunswick has reported only one new case of COVID-19 in more than two weeks and there have been no COVID-related deaths at all. Ross Lord has more on the lessons other provinces can take from New Brunswick's success.And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $252 million aid package for Canadian farmers and food processors struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. As Abigail Bimman explains, the industry says it needs more help now, or else food prices will soar.Turning away from COVID-19, about 6,000 fires burn across Canada every year, But Natural Resources Canada expects that number will soar this year. Robin Gill reports on why.Plus, is all soap effective at killing COVID-19? And how much protection do gloves really offer? Jeff Semple takes your COVID-19 questions to the experts.It's been 75 years since Canadians helped free the Netherlands from the Nazis during the Second World War.

French hospital that retested an old sample and found a positive case back in December what other countries are now being asked to do the Canadian province flattening the curve to have to have the people you have to have the knowledge New Brunswick's winning formula what lessons can other provinces learn the costly consequences of Kovach 19 on food prices whose potential you could be looking at eight to ten dollar heads lettuce or $12 cucumbers why your grocery bill could balloon and seventy-five years after a defining moment in history quiet gratitude for Canada's role in liberating the Netherlands global national with Donna freezin good evening and thanks for joining us we begin tonight with fresh mystery over how long Kovac 19 may have been circulating before it was first identified evidence has emerged in France of a positive case in late December 4 days before China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan the case in France came to light after a hospital there retested frozen blood samples from patients who had pneumonia like symptoms and one of those tests came back positive for kovin 19 the World Health Organization is now urging other countries to retest old blood samples - from suspicious cases Redman Shannon has our top story tonight i'm Arusha Mar looks back at a video of his time in intensive care in late December I thought it was the flu he told French news channel bfmtv he had a cough a headache and fever but recovered and was discharged on December 29th two days later China first reported cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause on January 23rd the epicenter city of Wuhan was locked down and a day after that the first case was confirmed in Europe a French citizen who had been to China the virus has since killed tens of thousands in Europe in April a French hospital decided to retest samples taken from 14 patients who were tested for pneumonia in December and January it was a volume get the positive or covetousness Novell said this altameyer sample was the only one that tested positive a backup test confirmed the finding it potentially changes the entire modelling for how covert 19 spread particularly because the 42 year old hadn't even been to China it's not surprising that's important because the given the earliest cases of copán 19 had symptoms all said already in early December so it's possible that some of the infected people traveled from Wuhan to other countries at that time the World Health Organization now wants other countries to go back and test - there's always a opportunity I think to sort of go back further even the to test samples we haven't actually as as I know it discussed that as yet but that is potentially of of interest so we can definitely take a look at that professor Luke O'Neill is working on a treatment for covert 19 he's reserving judgment until other tests show the virus was outside of China in December and science you might call a wacky results you gotta wonder what's going on there now one suspicion is the sample was contaminated somehow it's a positive sample from January say the results will also be key to the question of the virus's origin something that has recently become a political football between Beijing and Washington Redman Shannon Doble News London there is evidence tonight too that the original strain of Kovach 19 has mutated into a new more contagious strain the study was done by researchers at the Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico it has not been peer reviewed but is being shared now to help those working on vaccines it analyzed thousands of corona virus sequences and found a new strain appeared in February in Europe then migrated quickly to the east coast of the United States and has been the dominant strain across the world since mid-march wherever the new strain appeared it quickly infected far more people than the earlier strains that came out of Wuhan China here in Canada Quebec has the most cases and the most deaths and quebec's public health officer said today they will now go back and investigate suspicious cases in December and January Quebec has over 33,000 confirmed cases and nearly 2,400 people are known to have died from Kovach 19 that accounts for more than half of Canada's 62,000 cases more than 4,000 people in Canada are known to have died there are places though where the curve is flattening bc reported just eight new cases today the first single-digit increase in months and new brunswick after going 16 days without a new case recorded one new one today but it's had no deaths and only 119 cases tonight Ross Lord looks at what lessons others can learn from New Brunswick as the pandemic was growing in other parts of Canada New Brunswick went more than two weeks without recording a single new case of covert 19 its a streak no one saw coming and no one can fully explain do you have to have the people you have to have the knowledge it's especially impressive when you compare New Brunswick to its neighbors on April 19th Quebec had just topped 18,000 cases and has since almost doubled Nova Scotia with a population similar to New Brunswick's had about 700 cases and has since increased by more than 300 on that same date April 19th New Brunswick at just 118 cases and by the end of Monday that number had not budged marking 16 consecutive days without a positive test even New Brunswick's relatively low rate of testing doesn't account for those differences of course streaks don't last forever so today we have a confirmed a new confirmed case of kovat 19 our first case since April 18th but all of those 118 year Brunswickers who tested positive have recovered no one has died health researchers credit several decisions an early ban on students returning to class if they've been on March Break outside of Canada early rules on self isolation and closing the provinces border and two things New Brunswick doesn't have a large urban center and a major international airport where you have international airports of course there's much more opportunity for that spread to get there in the beginning and then continue with the community-based spread the province was first to ease social isolation rules and allow 2 households to share the same space but it won't relax border restrictions its banning temporary foreign workers even for farming and fishing industries but we need to protect our borders and I mean that's been the whole discussion around the temporary foreign workers it's it's not about it's going to be inconvenient it's about how do we minimize our risk health authorities insist there could be successive waves of the virus but at least New Brunswick is looking forward from a position of strength Ross Lord mobile News Quebec is promising new premiums and a bonus plan for full-time health care workers in hopes of recruiting more staff premier France while ago announced the plan during his daily reefing but offer no specifics our timeline says the province is down at least eleven thousand two hundred healthcare workers either because they tested positive for Kovac 19 or they fear getting it Montreal is transforming some of its transit buses into mobile testing clinics each one will be used to test about a hundred people per day for covin 19:00 and will be disinfected regularly the buses are part of a citywide effort to boost testing there have been over 16,000 confirmed kovat 19 cases in Montreal that's about half of Quebec's overall infections the federal government is trying to ease the pressure on Canada's farmers and food producers Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a two hundred and fifty two million dollar aid package today to help farmers and food processors hit hard by the pandemic as Abigail Beeman reports it falls far short of what the industry says it needs out making meat deliveries Michel Tremblay is glad to hear there's some federal help for food processors like him 77 million dollars for things like personal protective equipment but the day after the agriculture industry told MPs they need this media support the Prime Minister promised just a fraction 252 million dollars in total half is for producers facing extra costs backlogs of livestock because of meat processing plants slowdowns 100,000 extra cattle as one example we have the food and the consumers that want the food we just need little help getting the food to the consumers and this is not going to get it done it's quite upsetting to a number of farmers who are calling me now my phone is blowing up because they're mad the support is not there that we needed some in the pork and poultry industry are considering euthanasia for animals that cannot be processed Keith Currie says there will always be food on the shelves but selection and price will be affected you're looking at eight to ten dollar heads of lettuce or $12 cucumbers he knows where the price is going to settle at in the fall if we don't see some relief immediately this is an initial and investment and if we need to add more we will Ottawa is also launching a 50 million dollar food surplus program to

developed in collaboration with a partner company in Germany where trials began last month the first phase involves 300 healthy volunteers that could expand to 8,000 people in the second phase if these trials are successful Pfizer hopes to have a vaccine ready for emergency use as early as September and possibly wider distribution by the end of the year there is no guarantee though most human clinical trials health experts say a reasonable expectation for new vaccines to be developed tested and manufactured is about four years Russia is rapidly becoming a kovat 19 hotspot and there are mysterious cases now of doctors falling from hospital windows two of them were reportedly critical of how underprepared Russia is for koban 19 and complained about a lack of personal protective

sent flaming debris to the ground below at least a dozen fire trucks responded and used drones to fight the fire seven people are said to have minor injuries in Canada about six thousand wildfires burn every year and this year Natural Resources Canada predicts the season could be worse than usual in some places Robyn Gill looks at what to expect from west to east there is still a dark line that shows how close a fire came to destroying this property the fire was basically right here Maria jhope amove from Vancouver a year ago to start a hobby farm in Squamish this was her first fire ever her property was spared but she's an AW over how the flames encircled the farm with little damage at the time that we drove up it looked like a relatively small fire we could just see smoke from one of the properties and by the time that we came back here within 30 minutes the fire was in our backyard it was mid-april when the flames exploded in this part of BC's Squamish valley no one expected it it's too soon for fire season it's worrying them you know I've heard people say well it's always raining now it's wet we're okay now that's a full sense of security climate and forest experts are looking at the models for eastern Canada the summer weather is normal but take a look at the red on the map you can see that fire season is expected to explode to well above average in June summer will be fairly hot and dry in some places so what are depictions lawyers for a greater than average potential for fires in most of Western Canada and the big fires often smolder right into winter there's less precipitation there and so the ground is going to dry out faster leading to you know entire fuels faster and then as well just with predicted temperature so that obviously plays a big impact into how active a wild person is that has Joppa on guard it was nerve-racking enough when she heard that for crackling of flames for hoping that some of the fuel was cleared by this fire and that that will protect us over the summer these fires become part of Canada's landscape when summer arrives and yet most are caused by people those in natural resources and those who fight these fires don't think that kovat 19 is going to deter people from venturing out and risking their lives on two fronts the virus and these fires Donna Robin Gill in Squamish BC thinks ahead is any hand soap enough more of your questions about Kovac 19 answered [Music] we're all cleaning more to protect ourselves from Kovach 19 and more Canadians are accidentally poisoning themselves as a result Health Canada says between February and March there was a 58 percent increase in accidental poisonings compared to the same period last year incidents involving bleach made up 38% of all calls to poison control centers in March this happens to be world hand hygiene day washing your hands is still the easiest most effective and affordable way to prevent the spread of disease and this year it's sparking plenty of discussion and questions our Jeff simple went to the experts to get some answers my question is are all hand soaps as effective as they need to be any hand soap should work that is assuming you use it correctly studies suggest only around 5 percent of us wash our hands the right way so we've got German POW der which is used in some environmental contamination studies to show how germs can spread and I've already rubbed some of this powder on my hands assuming I touched a contaminated surface but you can only really see it in blacklight so I'm washing my hands like I normally would with soap and water front and back not really thinking about it too much there we go and lights out and you can see yeah I missed a few spots we may not really rub our thumbs or our fingertips which is how we touch a lot of our surfaces this doctor wrote a song to teach her own kids the proper technique [Music] that song inspired this video and to mark hand hygiene day it's now been translated into 27 languages another viewer asked when I go back to work should I be worried about using a shared washroom our germ powder shows the potential for contamination if there is a paper towel you can use a paper towel to press the button that releases a soap into your hand and you can wash your hands and rinse them and everything without without touching anything at all and what about wearing gloves the gloves can actually be more trouble than it's worth and it can be a challenge to remove your gloves without contaminating your hand this Ottawa police officer even tweeted this instructional video pitch top bottom line if you want to protect yourself the best way remains the old fashioned way wash your hands and if it helps sing a song Jeff sample Global News Toronto next in the Netherlands they never forget this day and the connection to Canada I was 15 when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands more than a hundred thousand that Jews never came home our men were put into forced labor by 1945 we were starving and then the Canadians capable and then the Canadians came they helped liberate the Netherlands from the Nazis that heritage minute commemorates a deep and abiding link between Holland and Canada forged during the Second World War on this 75th anniversary the gratitude has felt as deeply as ever even as Mike Armstrong explains if it can't be expressed as openly there are no big ceremonies at this the largest Canadian War Cemetery in the Netherlands hundreds of Canadians were supposed to have made the trip over even Prime Minister Trudeau planned to be on hand none of that is happening and Alethea Assam is down well one tradition still being kept was on the eve of the anniversary a speech by the Dutch King this town square would usually have been packed as the country remembered the 250,000 Dutch people killed during the Second World War in the same town square seventy-five years ago this week thousands celebrated the end of the war as it turned out too early German soldiers in a window opened fire on the crowd and killed more than 30 Canadian troops made it into Amsterdam the day after that shooting they had fought for months and had finally liberated the country but it wasn't only freedom they brought years under the boot of Nazi Germany had meant starvation Canadians brought food as well military historian David O'Keefe says other countries remember Canada's role during the two world wars but none the way the Dutch do when you are bringing food not only liberation from political domination and ideological domination but bringing the very basis of life to them that is something they will never forget a spirit of wild Fiesta reigns and towns and villages breed about the Canadian drive now there aren't many left who

Henry Minister Dix on the traditional territory of Okanagan speaking people the song he's and Esquimalt First Nations I'm here today to talk about bc's restart plan kovat 19 has transformed our province it's changed how we live work and connect with each other let's put tremendous pressure on our healthcare system and it has challenged the way we conduct ourselves in a way that we couldn't have possibly imagined my sympathy goes to the families of the hundred and twenty four British Columbians we've lost during this pandemic grandparents parents siblings loved ones people who died oftentimes without the comfort of their loved ones but instead they're at the last minutes we're health care providers putting themselves at risk to comfort those who we've left behind we're grateful to those health care workers and first responders who've been there to help the sick and the dying every day they put themselves in harm's way every day they've given them themselves to fight this virus COBIT 19 has taken something from all of us some more than others tens of thousands of British Columbians are out of work businesses are struggling many people are dealing with mental health challenges and it's been weeks since we've seen our friends or our families many feel confined and alone this pandemic has been tough on all of us and yet the people of BC have risen to the challenge with compassion and determination every day I'm inspired as adrienne and doctor henry are by the fourteen hundred and ninety four people who are fully recovered from kovat 19 by the businesses that have retooled to create PPE for first frontline workers here in BC and for those essential workers that are doing their job to make sure we can get the goods and services we need to continue our families and our communities I'm inspired by neighbors helping neighbors I'm inspired by artists and musicians thing are spirits it's because of that collective effort and sacrifice that we've been able to flatten the curve and save thousands of lives and we need to do this together as we go forward all this has been accomplished without a full lockdown thanks to the leadership and wisdom of dr. Henry administered dicks we put in place in British Columbia a plan that has slowed the growth of the virus and put us in a place for a safe restart of our economy it won't be the flipping of a switch we're gonna be proceeding carefully bit by bit one step at a time every step will be informed by the advice of the provincial health officer as well as the input from British Columbians in every corner of this province we need to ensure that people stay healthy and that British Columbians can move forward confidently as we proceed to the other side of the new normal the graph shows what's at stake we're all here to continue to do our part to make sure that that curve stays down and declines that's what we're looking for but it means when we see it that people are safe it means that we have capacity in our hospitals and it means that if you're sick anywhere in this province we have the ability to give you that care that you're going to need if we lose this discipline everything that we've worked for to this point will be lost we need to get it right and we need to make sure that we progressed together slowly and safely it was two months ago on March 5th that I activated B C's pandemic response plan alongside doctor Henry and Minister dicks two months but today we're starting the next chapter the chapter being called B C's restart plan this is not a return to normal it is that many have said and dr. Henry and others were going to the new normal and some people are afraid of opening up and I understand that they're not certain what it means for their loved ones and for their communities but we still need to make sure we're bracing to protect each other from this desperate virus and in order to do that we have to hang together and that includes really remote communities who don't know what this virus will do as it proceeds through the province it means that indigenous communities that are concerned about devastation from past pandemics they look to their elders and their their knowledge keepers and say how do we keep them safe in this environment it's okay to be concerned it's understandable to be concerned we're here to reassure you that we're going to do everything we can to help we're gonna do everything we can to keep you safe B C's restart plan is informed by health experts common sense and practical decision-making we will not move ahead unless it's safe to do so the restart will happen in phases spaced out over intervals of two to four weeks one of the three area of the three areas that we're gonna be focusing on our personal care everyone must keep doing what we have been doing to stop the spread that means washing your hands keeping so safe social distancing as we interact social interaction with other people we need to make sure that our connections with each other are safe and as we conduct economic activity businesses and services that become available have to be phased in as part of this plan the good news is we're already at phase one this is because BC did not completely shut down many jurisdictions are only now returning to the place that BC has been at for some time we already have safe operation for essential services to allow people to get basic supplies we already have been putting more resources into hospitals and residential care we already have childcare centers open for essential workers we already have K to 12 learning in classrooms for the children of parents of frontline workers we already have safe operations for construction manufacturing agriculture silviculture and many many more businesses when the weeks ahead BC will move into Phase two of the restart plan in this next phase we must continue to maintain a very high standard of personal conduct we're asking people to use common sense and follow these five principles as we implement the restart plan we're going to be focusing on no hygiene we're going to be staying at home if we're sick we're gonna focus on environmental hygiene safe social interactions and physical modifications we expect British Columbians to practice these every day we expect people to make informed choices about how to safely interact with each other as we start to relax some of the social restrictions small social gatherings with physical distancing will be allowed the choices you make about span expanding your social circle will depend on your age your occupation and the health of the people that you live with here's what it could look like grandchildren visiting grandparents with safe social distancing playdates with kids again with safe social distancing small numbers of friends gathering outdoors or in in home again small numbers the key is only small gatherings and we still need to be mindful when we're interacting with each other especially with vulnerable people that we keep our social circles tight we're asking everyone to follow these principles and to use your common sense restrictions on large gatherings are here to stay groups larger than 50 give the virus an opportunity to reimagine no matter how far apart you are large gatherings will not be allowed also at phase two will be reintroducing elective surgeries dr. Minister Dix and I will be talking about that in more detail tomorrow but this is the beginning of getting back to a place where our health care system can provide the important services that we all need and depend on we're also going to be returning to regulated health services like physiotherapy dentistry chiropractors and in person counseling I'm happy to say that we will also be reopening provincial parks for day use gatherings outside of the outside is a good thing physical well-being mental well-being all our attitude when we get outside and enjoy the splendor of British Columbia but we must do so in a safe manner we can't congregate in large groups when you visit a prevents park do so mindful of the people around you and observe physical distancing dr. Henry's been clear that this physical distancing outside will reduce the likelihood of transmission of the virus in fact the likelihood is very low provided you followed so some BC parks will let's enjoy that but let's stay close to home this is not the time for a road trip to another community for a hike or a holiday if you have a provincial park in your area by all means visit it do not travel great distance produced by WorkSafe BC will support businesses that they take steps towards successful reopening WorkSafe BC is developing industry specific guidance to help employers bring workers and customers back safely I want to acknowledge the organizations that are already well into the planning stages like the BC Restaurant Association who is working on a sector wide plan for the safe reopening of that industry and the BC Recreation and Parks Association who are working to bring back their programs many retailers have already found ways to reopen with no touch payment and Plexiglas barriers these plans take time and what you need to get them right so that workers and consumers can feel safe everybody has to be confident as we move into the new normal we can't just say businesses are open let's come and spend consumers need to be confident that the businesses that they're patronizing have done the hard work to be safe for their workers and their customers we'll also be expanding access to child care and in-class learning for K to 12 students we understand that parents have questions about the safety of their children as they return to school and it's okay for parents to be concerned but I want to reach that many schools are already operating safely within class learning for the kids of essential workers and we're not going to be forcing anyone to come back but minister fleming and i will be working to make sure students whose families need to have kids in class will have that opportunity tunity and we will continue to prepare for the full resumption of classes in September for those that are graduating in 2020 and will not be having a ceremony I regret that very much I hope that there will be ways that we can mark this milestone and the dates ahead and maybe next year we can have that party that you deserve after completing your grade 12 education as we open up we're going to be depending on our public transit system which is seeing a ridership decline in the neighborhood of 80 to 85 percent we've been doing what we can to improve hygiene and physical distancing on buses and Sky train and we'll have more to say about that in the days ahead finally we'll be recalling the legislature in the next number of weeks because elected members should be here to do what they can to collaborate on positive outcomes for the people of British Columbia I want to acknowledge the non partisan approach that all members of the legislature have taken to this point in time in the weeks ahead up is our government house leader Mike fire will be discussing plans for debates about the plans we have to go forward and the ideas the opposition wants to bring to bear so the people of British Columbia can have confidence that our democracy continues to thrive and flourish in these difficult times proceeding to the next step will depend on the outcomes in the path of kovat 19 over the next months we will continue to expand the number of businesses and services that can operate with strict safety protocols if we're doing well and we see more opportunities we'll be opening up more businesses like more parks with camping film and television production is very close movie theaters personal services like spas and hotels phase four won't be enacted until there's a vaccine treatments for koban 19 or community immunity has been achieved until these things happen BC will not be hosting rock concerts and conventions or any other large gatherings beyond 50 people the success of these plans depend on a number of factors to succeed we're going in large-scale testing rapid identification and contact tracing we're going to need a hundred percent commitment to physical distancing hand-washing and following the orders and guidance of dr. Henry and BC health officials we're going to need to hold the line on borders including mandatory quarantine for returning travelers and a time limit on the nan and a limit of course on non-essential travel we're gonna need to build up our healthcare system and work to make sure that we are resilient in the event of a further outbreak and we're going to need to maintain zero tolerance for illness in the workplace if you're sick you must stay home most important to our success we need to come together as a community and as a province businesses cannot succeed unless we decide to support them the only way they will survive is that people have confidence when they walk through their doors that they will be well and that business will be well at the same time every part of our province must be included we have to make sure everyone is supported and that we move through this pandemic to the restart and the recovery when I heard about people of Asian descent being pushed to the ground and buildings being defaced with anti Chinese slogans I was angry hate has no place in British Columbia period we need to stand together united against that type of racism whenever we see it Cobin 19 does not discriminate British Columbians shouldn't discriminate either if we're going to get through this we have to stop finger-pointing put our differences aside and work together to get it done our province was already in a public health emergency before the spread of Kovan 19 opioid deaths continue to climb in many parts of the province we must work to bring these deaths down as well climate change continues to be the challenge of our time the wildfire season is starting and the flood season has not yet ended and as we meet all of these challenges we must recommit to putting clean BC our climate action plan the center of our recovery today we take our first steps there's much more to do but the hard work starts with every step we will do it by continuing to support rural and remote communities we will do it by developing partnerships with indigenous peoples and working towards reconciliation and we will do it by making sure we deliver the support and resources our health care workers need times are tough but they will get better we're going to get through this and we're gonna come back even stronger together you can build back BC better than ever and someone just to my left to set it very ably all of us need to be kind be calm and be safe we're happy to take some questions star one to get in the queue and unmute your microphones you won't be audible until I call your name we're gonna start off with one question we will get to follow ups a time allowing our first question comes from vendor Sajan hi there I know and handshaking it kind of sounds like now that hubs are on the table so if I'm really careful about it can I hug my mom on Mother's Day very good question if my mom was here I'd want a hugger on Mother's Day but these are choices that you have to make we're not prescribing two British Columbians who they interact with and how they interact with them only to say that the best way to protect everyone is to observe social distancing be sure you're washing your hands regularly but if your circle has been tight and I know bender that your circle is tight I welcome you to hug your mom but people have to make those choices if your mom has got a compromised immune system it's best to keep that distance and we're saying quite clearly to British Columbians as dr. Henry and Minister Dix have been saying for over a hundred days now we have a set of rules that we follow we'll all come out of this better and we have been successful as a province extraordinarily successful by comparison to other jurisdictions in the world keeping in mind this is a global pandemic British Columbians are doing very very well but we can't give up the ground we've made mother's day is coming act responsibly be comfortable with your family keep the gathering slow and use your common sense our next question is from Bob Palmer good afternoon premier I hear you singing hold the line on the borders does that mean that the 14-day self-isolation requirement will be maintained both at the land border and the Eric Airport arrival and do you have any sense of how long it could be before we reopen the borders for regular crossing with the United States that's a good question and again as I've said in my remarks and as dr. Henry has directed us with the work of her team at public health is that when we see evidence that the curve is flattens when we see evidence that cases in other jurisdictions are reduced to a place that we're comfortable we'll start to look at opening the borders in in the months ahead but at this point if you're coming to British Columbia for an honesty it has to be for essential service or essential business and if you do come back from somewhere else in the world and you're going to be residing in British Columbia you will have to observe a 14-day isolation period we're going to be monitoring that with the federal government for the foreseeable future our next question is from marchello Bernardo a creamier just ask you about regarding the situation involving voluntary return to schools and childcare I have been speaking to a lot of childcare operators who say that they're worried about being forced to open up at full capacity or wondering what safety measures will be in place you mentioned earlier that everything's going to be voluntary could you elaborate well one of the things that you know the the silver lining and there are numerous silver linings as I said people the resilience of British Columbians every day I marvel one of the things that we focused on as a government when we were sworn in three years ago was developing a universal accessible affordable child care plan and now more than ever is that top of mind for British Columbians it has been an imperative for our success as an economy and for the well-being of families making sure that all participants in the family can be part of the economy mostly women have been restricted in their access to the economy because a lack of childcare so we've been doing what we can to build up a very robust system that has been shaken - no doubt and we're going to continue to work with providers to make sure that they're comfortable make we're gonna continue to work with early childhood educators to ensure that they're practicing physical distancing they're working with children who are not always as amenable to suggestion based on my experience as a parent and we need to find ways to work through that but I know ECE s and child care providers are committed to their vocation committed to the children of British Columbia and together we'll get through this next we have Justine hunter a key to this is staying home if you're sick and I'm wondering if you've got any further ideas about how your government is going to support especially those workers who are living paycheck to paycheck this is an issue that we we've been focused on for quite a few weeks now again it was you know the urging of the public health officer that we ensure that people do not come to the workplace when they're ill one of the significant outbreaks that Minister Dix and dr. Henry spoke about in the poultry sector was a result of people coming to work when they should have stayed home that Shona lights a graphic example of what we needed to address going forward not just within this pandemic but broadly I acknowledged my own weaknesses in this regard having come to when I should have stayed home over the past couple of years and people are not heroes when they do that they're villains so although when you're a villain you need to make sure you're feeding your family there's often an economic imperative that's the issue we need to address I've been working with the federal government Minister James has raised this issue with national finance ministers and we're going to look at whether we evoke worksafe to achieve this whether we use the employment insurance programs this is the one that we've been focusing on with the federal finance minister we're going to find a way to get there but we have to get there it's imperative to our well-being it's imperative to us not just getting past cope in nineteen but making this part and parcel of how we operate in the workplace next our question is from Sean Eckford Thank You mr. premier I wanted to get back to some comments you made about the upcoming long weekend because as you know in coastal communities that means one question people traveling on the ferries and people are looking for firm guidance on what is considered an essential trip on BC Ferries this coming long weekend can you go visit your grandmother in another town go to your second property that sort of thing now these are very good questions and our direction would be if you don't need to be travelling you shouldn't be traveling that we've been pretty clear on that having said that as we start to move into the various phases of the restart plan when we get into Phase three later into the summer that might be the better time to get to that second property if you have the good fortune of owning a second property in British Columbia there was a a cabin or a cottage you're a tax payer you have property in that community you have a right to be there but again you also have to acknowledge and recognize the permanent residents in those communities may not have access to acute care facilities may be concerned that the spread of the virus and in their community is something that they want to avoid and I think the best course of action would be to stay closer to your home until we get further into the summer we we need to make sure that our see ferry system continues to operate 85% reduction in ridership year-over-year tells me that that people aren't taking non-essential trips are not an enormous amount of non-essential trips but again I hope people will exercise their good judgments and and not travel to another community to enjoy the long weekend British Columbia every corner of British Columbia is spectacular and my experience of traveling around BC throughout my lifetime wherever you live is an outstanding place stay there and enjoy it our next question is from Katie De Rosa hi premier um it was mentioned it's been mentioned in European countries that there is sort of a threshold of cases or transmission rate spikes that would reach rigor lockdowns does BC have a trigger point for going back to further restrictions and if so is it perhaps the second wave is coming in the fall what what could be the risk to workers and businesses if there's another shutdown before I asked dr. Henry to respond to that I'll say that British Columbia has been charting its own course from the beginning Minister Dixon and dr. Henry raised alarm bells about Koba 19 long before anyone else was doing so and we were benefited from that as a community and that's why we're where we are today we are now proceeding to the restart plan and as I said we're going to be doing it cautiously based on the science if we see a spike will respond but dr. henwy will be giving us advice on that so best pass it to her thinking about from the very beginning and that's why you know this thoughtful and careful approaches the way we're going we do not want to be starting and stopping and starting and stopping so I believe that this plan and the way we've put it together gives us the tools so that we can increase our contacts our numbers and our safe contacts in a way that keeps us on a steady state for at least the coming months as I've mentioned before we don't know what's going to happen in the fall we don't know if there's going to be a resurgence once influenza and other taury viruses come back so that's why it's so important and part of our plan to make sure that we continue to have the vigilance in the public health system the testing that we need to the contact tracing and we'll be monitoring things very carefully but the plan and the thoughtfulness and the purpose that we have is to make sure that we can get through at least until the fall and we see what happens next we have a question from Rob Buffum oh hi premier thank you for your time I guess I just wanted to clarify in terms of the social distancing and broadening or social circles are people now allowed to do that immediately or as of this weekend or do they need to wait for this weekend and a related question is I'm curious what's the first thing you're going to do once these restrictions are lifted whether it's going out and you're hugging someone yeah well I'll let Bonnie take the first part and I'll do the second part yeah not not quite yet please we're telling you the planning we're working with people now to get the planning we we had another 23 people who were effective today we have hundreds of people who were following in public health still so we have a little bit of time we're looking at the middle of May you know if things continue to go if we're doing the same things that we're doing in the next week and a half you know by the long weekend is the time that we will be able to go out in and hug her family and for our part Rob as a government we take guidance from right across the province I have a economic recovery task force that represents a cross-section of British Columbians who have been giving me advice I talked to people reggae back tight I feel like I've been on the telephone for since since we we announced the pandemic back in early March here in British Columbia and what people are saying to me is they're anxious to get to that next phase but they're also anxious to not give up the ground that we've made so we resisted announcing this plan although we've been working on it for a month and a half we've resisted announcing this plan because oftentimes that's the trigger people go oh good Horgan just said it's time to get back to normal I'm not saying that I'm saying we have a plan to move to what will be the new normal and we're going to be taking guidance along the way from British Columbians people will open up their businesses and if no one shows up it won't be a success we need to make sure that consumers people are comfortable that we are doing everything we can as a society to protect each other and it's not quite time to get back to regular operating procedure we have laid out a plan that will go in phases we expect after the Victoria Day long weekend we'll see more businesses see their plans put in place we'll see more doors opening restaurants will start to operate pubs will start to open you can get that haircut provided that we have a good understanding of how we can operate these businesses with appropriate physical distancing and safety as the highest priority WorkSafe there to help public health officers are there to help I think all businesses want to get going but they also want people to show up and that means all hanging together and waiting a few more days before we start the real restart plan which will beginning after the Victoria Day long weekend Tania Fletcher is next hi premier on the boat lines rough timelines for all those things you just mentioned you know months and months for specifically business owners wanting dates now we know sectors will kind of submit industries specific plans for approval but how quickly can that be expedited and is there confusion of a backlog well many as I said many of our industries have been operating admittedly at at reduced speed but through dr. Henry and WorkSafe BC we may maintain our construction industry we we have construction sites whether it's residential construction building of schools hospitals roads you name it the what the the part and parcel of building British Columbia has been going on admittedly reduced pace now we can start to look at ratcheting that up but we still have to keep these principles in place by not shutting the way other jurisdictions did we instead focused on how can we operate safely we've been successful and we need to continue with that success by ensuring as we look at the industries and businesses that were closed by order that they are working with WorkSafe to make sure there's a framework of guidance for them to proceed that make sure that their customers are comfortable that make sure that the health officers are comfortable and that we don't have an influx of patients coming into our acute care system our next question is from cat's lip Ian what about travel throughout Canada the middle line as people start to move around a bit more than summer well I again I think that the market will decide some of this if there are no flights there's not going to be a lot of people getting on planes if there are people demanding to get on planes there'll be more flights we want to make sure that that's done in a reasonable way I know that the that YVR our major airport in Vancouver has been working over the past number of weeks to find ways to safely operate I don't know how many images we've seen oftentimes during holidays certainly at Christmas where airports are packed with people side by side frustrated at the ticket wicket asking where my flight is why did it get cancelled we cannot have that type of behavior that is just not going to be on so as we start to see more travel again in the I would suggest probably later in the summer if at all an international travel again will be determined by the number of flights and the number of people that are prepared to get on them these are personal choices that people will have to make we're going to support them as best we can by making sure that there are guidelines in place for appropriate operation that will keep people safe and will allow the economy to continue to restart and grow into the future up next is Keith Baldry again not to belabor the point on timing but mid May I interpret that to mean May 15 if I'm a restaurant owner do I have a reasonable expectation I can open my restaurant and May 15th if I make the changes required under under the sort of the new rules and secondly the kids sports came up in the technical briefing I haven't heard that today I just want to know how you envision kids sports playing out over the summer well I'll start with the back and work work to the front Keith the BC Recreation Association Parks and Recreation Association has been working to try and find ways that kids sports and summer camps and all of the things that make for an exciting summer for young people can take place and we're going to be working with them through public health to see if there's a way that we can see that happening there's been talk about professional sports as well that's a different different discussion that involves oftentimes people in seats I think that a local baseball game if people are using their own equipment they're not sharing equipment of course the bat is the bat but we can try our best to keep the bats clean I think that we'll see what local community organizations come up with and again what parents do by showing up with their kids on the the larger question we are going to be opening provincial parks most spiritual parks for day use on the 14th of May before the long weekends our expectation is that the the restart plan will kick in on the 19th of May which is the Tuesday after the long weekend so I think that we we wanted to make sure that people had a starting point to start preparing people have been doing that we've now given a plan we understand how we're going to operate I'm going to be asking all members of the legislature to be sounding boards in their community the best way for us to receive information is through an MLAs office so if they're a business that want more details contact your MLA these are going to be challenges for elected representatives but the nonpartisan approach that we've brought to bear here Minister dicks conducting numerous town halls with opposition members to make sure we're giving the public the information they need we're going to continue doing that in the restart will politics reimagine BC I'm sure it will for now we want all members of the legislature to be the point where come where companies small",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
businesses if they can't get access directly to WorkSafe they can't get access directly to public health officials of course we can start to set that up that's one of the roles and functions of mla's offices they're nonpartisan offices this is one of the tools we'll use to make sure people can access that information and get their businesses up and running our next question is from Graham wood hi premier what's your message took quite the worship and can you kind of walk me through the difference between how I can't have more than six people being my house but plates of worship or a restaurant perhaps could have 49 people well firstly on faith-based gatherings dr. Henry and Minister Dix and I have repeatedly had a number of conversations with faith leaders across the province multi-denominational multi-faith discussions and and oftentimes worship involves gatherings of numerous people whether it's a good whare a temple a synagogue a church we have been saying to faith leaders and faith leaders have been using and practicing with their congregations safe physical distancing and still being connected whether it be through virtual gatherings most temples most churches are large facilities you can have a number of people appropriately distanced you can have multiple services throughout the week there are a whole bunch of ways that individual faiths will try to address these issues going forward I don't know how many living rooms there are in British Columbia where 50 people could gather comfortably but there's certainly restaurants that have a capacity well exceeding that and those restaurants are putting in place Plexiglas barriers they're moving the number of tables they're spreading out the number of tables they're working with their staff they're talking about regular temperature checks of employees and a host of other issues the notion of wearing non-medical masks this is going to be I think part and parcel of our transit system going forward but we're still working those issues we've been pretty clear dr. Henry's been clear a non-medical mask will not protect you necessarily from koban 19 but it may protect someone else if you happen to be a carrier so we'll be looking at all of those issues but again it's a it's a it's a vote common sense if you can't have 50 people jammed into a small space but you could have 49 people spread through a larger space particularly when it comes to things like gatherings of particular religions next we have Penny Davos hi there and hearing a lot of the comments that hi can you hear me really loud there have been a lot of infants born in the last couple of months families are really eager to share these new family members with loved ones and I'm just wondering if you can offer some advice for new parents what they should do in this circumstance everyone wants to cuddle those kids and I just um I hope that you can give us some advice particularly with Mother's Day on the horizon great question you know right now we need to hold the line and we need to keep our our circles small so now's not the time to do that but we are looking at you know come the end of the middle of May yes if things continue to go the risk is low enough in our community but these are the decisions you're going to have to make if you expand your circle you know that you're going to be in contacts of their contacts so you need to do it thoughtfully and you need to understand the risk in your family and we do know infants you know are at risk of having more severe illness we know that we need to protect them from a whole bunch of things so absolutely spread your circle but be very aware and be very careful and it's not you you might have to do it in in small steps right now next we have Mary Brooke taking my question your data data modeling and your current plans are for people to doing 60% subnormal distancing or 40% cynical distancing and in the fine print it says that this data is stable for about four weeks so what sort of things would cause you to impose more restriction on social interaction again so just to say that this is modeling and that's a caveat because modeling is only good it only reflects what's being put into it and so it is something that has helped us come up with this strategies that we're talking about so it's a common-sense way it helps us say okay if we are between you know where we are now and we can essentially double our contacts then we'll probably be okay and we'll be continuing to follow the models and putting in our data as we go along so it's not that that's going to predict what's happening and what we need to know is that okay that gives a little bit of a sense of what could happen and how can we increase our social connections and increase our economy and get things moving again but staying within that safety zone so really it's it's not 60 point or 62 or 49 it's about saying okay we need to take some some measures to increase our numbers of contacts and the safety of the contacts that we have and that's the way that we can stay in that safe zone we have time for two more questions first Lisa used premier I'm wondering what your biggest concern is going forward is it making sure that people are going to stay at home when sick is it to have that backup in place for a shift you said people who are working you know check to check well I have a thousand concerns I don't put them in a hierarchy every day all of us have come to work in extraordinary circumstances and every day has been a day that we've never experienced before and we've all been doing our best across sectors across communities across the country in fact to try and find a way to bring unity to bring social cohesion to ensure the health and well-being of all British Columbia's and Canadians so those are the those are the primary focuses and that's at the higher level when we get down to the basics I'm concerned that 400,000 British Columbians have applied for the emergency worker benefit program that we've had open for the past five days or six days today 400,"000 British Columbians out of work that's a big challenge and it's going to take time to absorb those workers back into the economy but the good news is before the pandemic BC had a robust economy and one of our bigger challenges was finding workers for jobs so I think the future is going to be solid but we need to make sure that future is focused on public health and ensuring that workplaces are safe for workers they're safe for customers and that all British Columbians will benefit a game from a strong and robust economy but we are in uncharted territory and and every day we try and find the best way forward together and we have the benefit of superlative public health officer a very good friend and those standing Health Minister and a cabinet from in a legislature at the present time that is singularly focused on the best outcomes for British Columbians that I don't think has ever happened before so we should take some comfort in that our final question is from Richard zisman schools what do you say to teachers and parents who are hearing this nervous about going back can you explain to them what these routine daily screenings look like and for families that are golden sports I know can't ask about this but more specifically I'm hearing a lot from hockey players do you expect that there will be hockey games played at any point in this year here in versed Columbia for kids or even rec league adults well hockey and and other sports whether they're played in beer leagues or whether there's youth minor or hockey organizations that we're going to be working through that into the fall we have a season ahead of us for baseball and other summer activities we're going to be focusing on that first and foremost I have written two head of the NHL as well as the NHL Players Association to offer British Columbia as a place to potentially restart the NHL assuming that the games will be played without without audiences but instead would be played for television unfortunately the BC Lions need to have bums and seats and I don't see that happening but we'll be working with the CFL as well which also creates economic activity within our community on the broader issue of going back to school Rob Fleming has been working with Terry mooring the head of the BC Teachers Federation with other support workers in the system with trustees with parent groups we want to make sure that we can safely get kids back into classrooms it's not just about reading writing and arithmetic I answered a question from a viewer on one of the television networks yesterday a young a young viewer who wanted to get back to school to see her friends and and that is a reasonable thing for young people to do school is a place of joy for many people that may not have been for some but it is a place of joy for young people and they want to get back to it but we want to make sure that's done safely and we don't want anyone to feel that they're obliged to we've seen virtual learning taking place over the past number of weeks positive outcomes there but it's not perfect we want to make sure we can do a dry run between now and the end of June or pardon me the the beginning of June's at the end of June we're not anticipating any increase in in class teaching until well after the mailing we kept minister Fleming and I will be having more to say about that probably later next week or perhaps after the the long weekend but what I'm hearing from people is are there concerns absolutely but there's also an overwhelming desire to get back to a place where we can have kids interacting with each other learning about not just how to read how to writes and how to count but also how to be interact with other people this brings up the issue I raised earlier about racism in British Columbia our social interactions in our schools multicultural schools where there are people from around the world young kids you know there's a school district inverter be 109 languages are spoken in one of the schools in Edmonds and Burnaby that is an outstanding thing to talk about and that is the type of British Columbia that we all want to see people working together in harmony enjoying living in one of the greatest places on the planet schools a vital part of that we're not going to force anyone but we're working with all of the various stakeholders and their numerous everyone's got a common purpose and that's to make sure that we can get kids back into classrooms in a safe manner as soon as possible but likely that we're not we're in fact I know we won't see full participation until September if at that time thanks everybody

Putin since you've been in Russia well I don't think it really has changed because the question might presume that I had a positive opinion at some point I think everyone would agree probably including the Russian President himself that he is an authoritarian leader I think the Russian government broadly does not have a good record on human rights and that hasn't changed how odd is it to you that while you've been there consensus here has hardened that they are the actors who interfered in our last presidential election I don't think that's especially surprising there was a story published in The New York Times actually reporting on a study in February of 2018 and was also done in the Washington Post a few months prior to that about the record of electoral interference and they looked at the history of Russia and the Soviet Union and an electoral Intel interference by intelligence agencies and they found I think 36 different cases of electoral interference over roughly the past 50 years but then they also looked at the United States intelligence services and found that we hit enter feared in foreign elections eighty-one different times now this is not to say one is better than the other it's not about that it's about budget about capability but we do what we do see from this is that what happened in 2016 actually was not unusual from the perspective of intelligence agencies this is what they believe are they are hired to do what we have to do is find out how to secure our systems against the attacks that we know are inevitable something you've been asked before something you have answered before but since this is a fresh occasion we'll will ask it again why not stay in this country and face the music if you believed in the strength of your conviction this is a great question Brian and I'm glad you asked it when we say face the music the question is well what song are they playing I was intentionally charged as every major whistleblower in the last decades has been with the very particular crime this is a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917 and and this is a law that is explicitly designed to prohibit a meaningful defense in court this is applied or this law is used against people who's the only thing that they've done and this is by the government's own terms the only thing the government accuses people defending themselves against this charge I have done is that they have told something to a journalist that the government considers classified that is the whole of the crime they don't consider whether it was good or bad they don't consider whether or not it caused harm simply did you tell something classified to a journalist if you did the jury is not allowed to consider and in fact they're explicitly forbidden from considering why you told journalists they're explicitly forbidden from considering did it result in a public benefit right did it further the public interest instead they simply say did you tell a journalist let the glass buy so I am NOT if I had stayed in the United States and my good friend Daniel Ellsberg by the way that has told me that I was right not to stand and wait for an inevitable arrest because the laws and the way they're enforced today is not the same as the 1970s when he came forward with the Pentagon Papers I would not have received a fair trial there would not have been much of a trial at all I would only have received a sentencing and the question there is what message does that send whether you like me or not I could be the best person in the world I could be the worst what message does a conviction where you spend the rest of your life in prison for telling journalists things that change the laws of the United States that have resulted in the most substantive reform so intelligence authorities since the 1970s if the only result of doing that is a life sentence in prison the next person who sees something criminal happening in the United States government will be discouraged from coming forward and I can't be a part of that where do your parents come down on what you did in the book we learn a lot more than we knew about them they were both we say this in quotes deep Staters we learn that they both had varying degrees of security clearances in their lives yeah I come from a federal family my father worked for the military my mother works for the courts my whole line going back has worked in the in the government service so I think this was difficult for them and in fact one of the things that I will be eternally grateful for is the fact that they still stand by me today and believe that I did the right thing were they present for your wedding you've gone and gotten married in the years since we've last spoken there hasn't been a wedding yet actually we were married but it was just a paperwork sighs in a courthouse because Lindsay and I had been living together we had been in love with each other we had been in a relationship for more than ten years there will be a wedding someday Brian and I hope you'll be there what do you make of Donald Trump there are so many things that are said about the president right now and so much thinking and honestly I try not to think about it there's so much chaos and there are so many aggressive and offensive things said I think even his supporters would would grant that but I think he's actually quite simple to understand Donald Trump strikes me like nothing so much as a man who has never really known a love that he hasn't had to pay for and so everything that he does is informed by a kind of transactional ism I think and what he is actually looking for is simply for people to like him unfortunately that produces a lot of negative effects do you believe he is a threat to national security I mean this is the question of who defines national security what is national security when we used to talk about national security we thought about public safety but now national security really means the security of the system itself the institution of government and I think he's made it his stated goal to change the way that system works I think we have seen tremendous harm done to civil liberties in the United States increasingly since September 11th and I haven't seen any reduction in the rate of that we have several important jobs vacant in this country including director of national security national security advisor is that a threat to our security I think it really says something about where we are what this point in our history looks like when we find that there are not enough people in the country that are willing not to serve in the White House and qualify to serve in the White House who all sides of the government feel comfortable working with and who they can back we are in a time that is increasingly fractured and I think that's a product of the fact that look if you look around at the world right now when you look at news when you look at news coverage when you look at every controversy that we see something has changed and that is that it has become increasingly popular for your feelings to matter more than the facts and I think that's toxic to a democracy because if there's one thing that we have to have to be able to have this discussion to be able to learn to live with people that we disagree with we can't have a conversation about what we should do we can't have a conversation about where we are going if we can't agree on where we are if we can't agree on what is happening facts have to matter more than the feelings you've said your greatest fear over what you did was that things would not change have things changed would you do it again today knowing what you know now this is a significant portion of the the final chapter of my book things have changed and I would do it again if I changed anything I would hope that I could have come forward sooner it took me so long just to understand what was happening and it took so long not to realize that nobody else was going to fix this believe me when I say I did not want to light a match and burn my life to the ground no one does nobody really wants to be a whistleblower but the results of that have been staggering I thought this was gonna be two days story I thought everybody was gonna forget about this a week after the journalist ran the first stories in 2013 but here we are in 2019 and we're still talking about it in fact data security surveillance the internet manipulation and influence that's provided or produced rather by a corporate or governmental control of this permanent record of all of our private lives that's been created every day by the devices that we have before 2013 if you said there's a system that's watching everything you do the government is collecting records of every phone call in the United States even for those people who are not suspected of any crime it was a conspiracy yes there were some people who believed it was happening yes there were academics who could say this was technically possible yes there were technologists who could went this is something that could be done but what we didn't have it was we the world of 2013 we suspected some suspected that this was happening the world after 2013 we know that it's happening and this is the critical importance of journalism particularly in this moment that we have today the distance between speculation and fact is everything in a democracy because that's what what lets us as we did post 2013 change our laws now the very first program that was real to newspapers I has since been terminated Barack Obama who criticized me so strongly in June of 2013 by January of 2014 was proposing that this program be ended eventually it was ended under the USA Freedom Act the NSA argued that mass surveillance was legal bulk collection as they they call it they said 15 different judges authorized this what they didn't tell us was that those 15 judges all belonged to the rubber-stamp FISA Court that over 33 years had been asked 33 thousand nine hundred times by the government to approve surveillance requests only said tow in 33 years 11 times now this was a court that was never designed to interpret the Constitution right it was never designed to create novel powers for the intelligence community it was just designed to stamp basic routine warrants now we know what has changed the very first open court outside of these secret rubber-stamp courts that got this case in front of them I was judge Leon in a federal court and then a court of appeals and said that the NSA's mass surveillance activities were violating even the very loose standards of the Patriot Act they broke the law he further said these programs are likely unconstitutional and this would not have happened if we couldn't say this is real this is actually happening and I just want to make clear that's not me saying that that's not speculation that was the determination of the Supreme Court just a few months before I came forward in a famous case Amnesty versus clapper I I believe it was in February of 2013 or door December of 2012 all the way to the Supreme Court these surveillance authorities were being challenged the plaintiff said the government has a mass surveillance program it has impacted this human rights organization they have been spied on in secret by the government the government said that may be but if it's happening we will neither conform confirm nor deny that it's happening it is a state secret and because you can't prove it the court should be forbidden from ruling on the constitutionality of this program and sadly the Supreme Court of the United States agreed they said this program could be unconstitutional but if you cannot prove it exists we cannot evaluate it that's what 2013 changed on the legal side we have now had the GDP or we have firt had the first European regulation that are trying to limit the amount of data that can be collected secretly and used against populations broadly and we have also seen the basic structure of the Internet itself change in response to this understanding that the network path that all of our communications cross when you request a website when you send a text message when you read an email for so long those communications have been electronically naked or unencrypted before 2013 more than half the world's internet communications were unencrypted now far more than half are measured by just web traffic from where the world's leading browsers the Google Chrome browser some figures showed it more than 80 percent the entire world has changed in the last few years it hasn't gone far enough the problems still exist and in some ways they've gotten worse but we have made progress that would not have been possible if we didn't know what was going on related question what today can the government do to your phone and your laptop the phone and laptop of any American what's the extent of the government's reach if they're determined to reach into your life we could talk about this question for hours Brian but we don't have time so I'll try to summarize hacking has increasingly become what governments consider a legitimate investigative tool they use the same methods and techniques as criminal hackers and what this means is they will try to remotely take over your device once they do this by detecting a vulnerability and in the software that your device runs such as Apple's iOS or Microsoft Windows they can craft a special kind of attack code called an exploit they then launch this exploit at the vulnerability on your device which allows them to take total control of that device anything you can do on that device the attacker in this case the government can do they can read your email they can collect every document they can look at your contact book they can turn the location services on they can see anything that is on that phone instantly and send it back home to the mothership they can do the same with laptops the other prong that we forget so frequently is that in many cases they don't need to hack our devices they can simply ask Google for a copy of our email box because Google saves a copy of that everything that you've ever typed into that search box Google has a copy of every private message that you've sent on Facebook every link that you've clicked everything that you've liked they keep a permanent record of and all of these things available not just to these companies but to our governments as they are increasingly deputized as sort of miniature arms of government what about enabling your microphone camera if you can do it they can do it it is trivial to remotely turn on your microphone or to activate your camera so long as you have systems-level access if you had hacked someone's device remotely anything they can do you can do they can look up your nose right they can record what's in the room the screen may be off as it's sitting on your desk but the device is talking all of the time the question we have to ask is who is it talking to even if your phone is not act right now you look at it it's just sitting there on the charger it is talking tens or hundreds or thousands of times a minute to any number of different companies who have apps installed on your phone it looks like it's off it looks like it's just sitting there but it is constantly chattering and unfortunately like pollution we have not created the tools that are necessary for ordinary people to be able to see this activity and it is the invisibility of it that makes it so popular in common and attractive for these companies because if you do not realize they're collecting this data from you this very private and personal data there's no way you're going to object to it what about its ability to track its own and talk to me specifically about the case of Jamal khashoggi so in the case of Jamal Khashoggi this is a Washington Post reporter and a primary critic of the Saudi regime he was lured into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in Turkey and while his fiance waited outside for him to get the paperwork he needed in order to marry her he was murdered by the Saudi government allegedly on the orders of the Crown Prince now we have to ask ourselves how did the Saudi government decide that he was worth killing how did they decide when and how they would kill him how did they know this opportunity was going to arise how do they know what his plans and intentions were that they needed to stop from their perspective we don't have evidence that his phone personally was hacked unfortunately because we do not have his phone but we do have the phones of his friends who were living in exile in Canada and we do know thanks to the research of a group called the citizen lab affiliated with a university in Canada that their phones were hacked which means their conversations with Jamal khashoggi were intercepted and this allowed the Saudi regime to know that he was intending to create an electronic protest movement they didn't need to know from his friend's phone or even from his phone that he was travelling to the consulate because he had to make an appointment but it did tell them his private intentions his hopes and dreams for a different government for their country and perhaps although we do not know for sure on that basis they decided to murder him once your phone is hacked what is in their hands is not simply your device it is your future it's important also to remember how did the government of Saudi Arabia manage to hack these people's phones which are modern phones well they didn't have this capability in their government they didn't have this level of intelligence capability available to them directly so they purchased it from a digital arms broker a company called the NSO Group an Israeli company in this company the only thing they do is manufacture digital weapons kind of hacking tools they can be used against the critical infrastructure that all of us rely on the phones and our pockets they primarily target devices such as the Apple iPhone and they sell this capability to break into phones of people around the world for millions and millions of dollars to some of the worst governments on earth and the only meaningful oversight that they have unfortunately because the export control laws for these kind of digital weapons are extremely weak in Israel is their own internal ethics board this is oh it was fine we didn't break any rules that has to change what about the public attitude held by millions of everyday Americans all I've got on a computer is pictures of my family CCTV cameras that are prevalent in a ton of American cities and overseas capitals those cameras are your friend if you're innocent and have nothing to hide well I'd say that's very much what the average Chinese citizen believed or perhaps even still to this day believes but we see how these same technologies are being applied to create what they call the social credit system if any of these family photos if any of your activities online if your purchases if your associations if your friends or in any way different from what the government or the powers-that-be of the moment would like them to be you're no longer able to purchase train tickets you're no longer a to board an airplane you may not be able to get a passport you may not be eligible for a job you might not be able to work for the government all of these things are increasingly being created and programmed and decided by algorithms and those algorithms are fueled by precisely the innocent data that our devices are creating all of the time constantly invisibly quietly right now our devices are casting all of these records that we do not see being created that in aggregate seemed very innocent you were at Starbucks at this time you went to the hospital afterwards you spent a long time at the hospital after you left the hospital you made a phone call you made a phone call to your mother you talked to her until the middle of the night the hospital was an oncology clinic even if you can't see the content of these communications the activity records what the government calls metadata which they argue they do not need a warrant to collect tells the whole story and these activity records are being created and shared and collected and intercepted constantly by companies and governments and ultimately it means as they sell these as they trade these as they make their businesses on the backs of these records what they are selling is not information what they're selling is us they're selling our future they're selling our past they are selling our history our identity and ultimately they are stealing our power and making our stories work for them what devices do you use in your life now and have you accepted the notion that you are watched rather constantly well probably every intelligence the world is definitely targeting me in trouble anything they can just as they did with Jamal khashoggi in regards to what are my plans and intentions I try not to make that easy for them if I get a smart phone and I need to use a phone I actually open it up before I use it I perform a kind of surgery on it to physically desolder or sort of melt the metal connections that hold the microphone on the phone and I physically take this off I remove the camera for the phone and then I close it back up I seal it up and then if I need to make a phone call I will attach an external microphone on and this is just so if the phone is sitting there and I'm not making a call it cannot hear me now this is extreme most people do not need this but for me it's about being able to trust our technology my phone could still be hacked my laptop could still be hacked and just as I told you before the same principles applied to me if it is hacked they can do anything to the device that I can do so my trust in technology is limited but just because that's how it is today doesn't mean that's how it has to be and a large majority of my work with the freedom of the press foundation where I serve as president of the board is dedicated to trying to make technology more secure to try to create programs and protocols by which we can make the communications of sources and journalists more confidential because if we lose the confidentiality between sources and journalists we lose access to those essential facts that let us understand what's happening in the world and unfortunately under this White House just like under the prior White House we see the sources of very important stories that have advanced the public interest facing retaliation from a very angry government I believe it's in the first half of the book and I'm paraphrasing you come out and just say the computer guy knows everything or at least he should what part computer guy are you were you and what part trained spy well for the vast majority of my career I was what was called a systems engineer or a systems administrator an administrator sort of maintains and expands a system that they have inherited and a systems engineer sort of develops new projects new capabilities for these systems roles what this means in short was that all of the systems the NSA and the CIA that I was put in charge of I had total access to and this is just what happens with the systems administrator when you think about a computer system who gives someone else access well someone has to be the original authority that has access to everything that was me and so I would say the computer guy knows everything that's not a boast that's simply the way these systems are designed that's the way they're structured and this is very much a vulnerability because it means that you have to trust this this administrator will work to the good of the users but what happens when the people using that network the people constructing that network are going against the benefit of the broader society and this put me in a very interesting kind of conflicted position I could do what the NSA wanted me to do or I could do what the Constitution of the United States the the public of the United States needed me to do which was report that my agency had broken the law do you regard yourself as a journalist these days I'm not I'm not I have tremendous respect for journalists but I try to keep a distance particularly in this moment where so much of journalism is coming under attack because the government has a tremendous incentive to discredit me to make people distrust me and so if I hold myself out if I start reporting stories if I start talking to sources if I try to start advancing what the public knows on a personal level my reputation could could sort of poison instead I keep a distinction what I do is I try to aid the work of journalism but I am NOT myself a journalist your book is highly personal tell us about the price your then girlfriend now wife paid for your actions and how you feel she was miss portrayed in the eyes of the world when we got that first kind of thumbnail sketch of who she was so in the wake of the revelations of mass surveillance in 2013 this was suddenly the world's biggest story in every country they were talking about the same thing and unfortunately that meant that everyone who was connected to me in some way they were also talking about because they were trying to say who I was where I came from and this unfortunately meant that Lindsey my lifelong partner was intensely investigated both by the FBI in the United States she didn't know what I was doing I could not tell her what I was doing because if I had they would have said she was an accessory to the crime they would have said she was part of a criminal conspiracy so long as she didn't immediately pick up the phone and say help help someone's talking to a journalist and so this meant that I couldn't tell her she learned about what was going to happen the same way everybody else did about what is happening the same way everybody else did she saw me on TV which probably makes me the worst boyfriend in the history of the United States but she stuck by me and we are reunited and together today and I will never be able to repay her for the faith that she's shown me but the media had a tremendous amount of salacious reporting when they realized that she taught toll pole fitness classes which are quite popular for him in these days they called her a stripper even though she's never been one even though she's a poet even though she's a photographer they sexualized her they focused on her body they focus on her image because that's what got attention she's a much more complex and deep figure than the media ever gave her credit for she is more brave then anyone can possibly understand and she's more political and intelligent than any of these reporters at the time could appreciate her politics in fact influenced mine and I'd like to think I learned as much from her or perhaps even more than she ever learned from me you paint a portrait of what some of us knew and that was that you were a thoroughly American kid in your upbringing you wake up every day in Russia you go to sleep every night in Russia are you actively seeking to get out are you as has been reported looking for asylum elsewhere well this is not an actively seeking this is not a new thing and this is important history especially for those people who don't like me for those people who doubt me who have heard terrible things about me it was never my intention to end up in Russia I was going to Latin America and my final destination was hopefully going to be Ecuador when the United States government heard that I had left Hong Kong where I met the journalists they canceled my passport they gave press conferences about it which meant I wasn't allowed to board my ongoing flight which was going to take me that's a Latin America rather than applying for Russian asylum rather than saying I'll play ball with any Russian intelligence service just please protect me I said no I will not cooperate with the Russian government or any government instead what I did as I was trapped for 40 days in an airport I don't know a year longest layover is but 40 days was was a tough stint I applied for asylum in 27 different countries around the world traditional US allies places like France and Germany places like Norway that I felt the US government and the American public could be comfortable that was fine for whistleblower being and yet every time one of these governments got close to opening their doors the phone would ring and they're in their Foreign Ministries and on the other end of the line would be a very senior American official it was one of two people then Secretary of State John Kerry or then Vice President Joe Biden and they would say look we don't care what the law is we don't care if you can do this or not we understand the protecting whistleblowers and granting asylum as a matter of Human Rights and you could do this if you want to but if you protect this man if you let this guy out of Russia there will be consequences we're not gonna say what they're what they're gonna be but there will be a response I continue to this day to say look if the United States government if these countries are willing to open the door that is not a hostile act that is the act of the front of a friend if anything if the United States government is so concerned about Russia right shouldn't they be happy for me to leave and yet we see they're trying so hard to prevent me from leaving I would ask you why is that I'm guessing Joe Biden is not your candidate for 2020 actually I don't take a position on the 2020 race look it's a difficult position being in the executive branch it's a difficult position being in power and you have to make unpopular decisions I would like to think having seen now in 2019 that all of the allegations against me did not come true national security was not harmed as a result of these disclosures but they did win the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism the laws were changed as a result the courts said these programs were

"constitutional we live in a safer and more secure world because the Internet is safer and more secure as a result of understanding these common vulnerabilities which not just US intelligence agencies we're exploiting but our adversaries were exploiting one close these holes we do not become more vulnerable we become more secure in 2013 it's fair to say some of these officials some of these candidates grow well the intelligence services are saying this guy's dangerous they're saying this is a risk they're saying this shouldn't have happened in 2019 we can see that no evidence has ever been presented that the public understanding mass surveillance is real has caused any kind of harm whatsoever no one has died no terrorist attacks have succeeded because we knew about this stuff these programs work regardless of whether or not you know about them but we have seen the public benefits substantiated year after year after year and so I'd like to think these people would reevaluate their position you know there are government officials who would push back very strong on your assertion that national security was not harmed you do you chose not to stop with your revelations at what was being done to Americans and you got into America and its allies and perceived enemies when we're looking at the reports that were published in 2013 it's important to understand I never published a single story the number of documents that I revealed is zero what I did was I collected an archive of material showing criminality or unethical or unconstitutional behavior on the part of the United States government I provided this archive to journalists who were required as a condition of access to this material not to publish any story because it's interesting they could publish no story simply because it's newsworthy they were only allowed as so far as the agreement went to publish stories that they were willing to stand up and say we're in the public interest to know and this is not some crazy fly-by-night organization these are newspapers like the Washington Post like the New York Times like the Guardian and in every case this process was followed now as an extraordinary check on top of this in case I went too far in case I collected a document that was too hot or I misunderstood things or the jernt the journalists misunderstood things the journalists were further required to go to the government in advance of publication and they were required to do this at my request and warned the government this is the story that we're gonna run this is what it's about this is what we're gonna say so the government could argue against it to create an adversarial check on what the journalists and I were trying to do to reconstruct the system of checks and balances in the United States that hid itself failed in the government you know because that process was followed so scrupulously that's why I am so confident that no harm happened no harm occurred now if there are those in the government that say harm took place if there are those in the government who say people have died I ask you this why haven't they proved it you know better than anyone Brian that these government officials are more than happy to pick up a phone and make a leak to the New York Times every day of the week I if they had some evidence that somebody was hurt if they had evidence that a terrorist attack got through because of this journalism it would be in the front page of every newspaper in the world and despite six years of history that's never happened describe your life today what is every day like how are you supporting yourself and and as a simple equation if the Russians have reached so effectively into our lives and our electoral systems they must be all over your life so that was several different questions but yeah I'm sure the Russian government is trying to spy on me I'm sure the United States government is trying to spy on me everyone's trying to spy on me the thing is I don't cooperate with them my allegiance is to my country my allegiance is to my Constitution now in my terms of my daily life it's actually pretty ordinary Oh which is to say it's not so interesting I've always been something of an indoor cat right among nightclubs and partying my life since I was a child has always been mediated by a screen that's my choice so not much actually changes in my day-to-day whether I'm living in New York or Berlin or Moscow in terms of my work which a lot of people are curious about this I think is a polite way of people asking do you work for the Russian government do you accept money from the Russian government you know are you living in Russian government housing are you in a bunker are there guards and of course the answer to all of these is no no I'm not what I do for a living is speak professionally and now I'm actually an author I have a speaker's bureau it's called the American program Bureau and you can call them and you can book a public event I speak at universities I speak at corporate events I speak at cybersecurity conferences to talk to people about what is happening on the internet what is the future of surveillance and how can we protect ourselves I'm very fortunate to have had that opportunity and it's meant that I've had a quite comfortable life and in quite a difficult position the former White House aide HR Haldeman left us with an expression for the ages and when he said you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube for Americans who feel that that this is just a behemoth that they could there's no way they could have any control over it for Americans who long ago decided we're just going to have to live with this surveillance how could it possibly be receded or rescinded or stopped we can stop a program we can thwart an attack we can make a device more secure but as you imply the system is still better the institutions and agencies and companies that produced these attacks that are creating new methods of spying every day will still be there the fundamental change not just in the United States but around the world that has to happen is we have to stop thinking about the limitations on how data is used as data protection regulations right now when we talk about what Google and Facebook are doing right now when we talk about what the NSA is doing right now when we talk about what rival governments are doing what the Russians are doing what the Chinese are doing what the North Koreans and the Iranians are doing we're constantly thinking about all right this data has been collected and these companies have it how do we regulate their use regulating the use is a mistake we should do that but that's the wrong focus it is the collection of data that is a problem when you start trying to regulate use you're going to the collection has already happened the collection was already legal one of the fundamental flaws in u.s. privacy legislation is the fact that we are one of the only advanced democracies in the world that does not have any basic privacy law whatsoever we have the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution which is the reason that I came forward but that restricts what the federal government can do that restricts what the state governments can do it doesn't restrict what companies can do and as you know as everybody knows these companies are playing a bigger and bigger part in the world today we have to say all of these records that they're creating about all of us all this control that they're developing from these surveillance programs whether they're saying they're doing it for targeting advertisements or whether they're doing it for targeting killings these records belong to the people that they are about not to the companies and this is a fundamental change that we have never discussed in a meaningful way broadly and publicly but we have to because all of these governments have said you know the the mass surveillance system why do we have it why is it useful they say because of terrorism they say it's saving lives they save its oppressive anting attacks but no less than Barack Obama and the response to the 2013 revelations created two independent Commission's to investigate exactly the answer to that question were these programs effective in stopping terrorist attacks did these revelations cause harm to national security it was called the privacy and civil liberties oversight board and the president's review group on intelligence and communications technologies and despite having an enormous budget despite having complete access to classified information despite the fact that they interviewed the heads of the FBI the NSA the CIA you know the full alphabet soup they found in the government's own words the kind of mass surveillance that's represented by this bulk collection program where the NSA was secretly collecting the phone records of every American and everybody else around the world every day under an authority provided by a secret court order that nobody even knew existed that program had never made their own words a concrete difference in a single counterterrorism investigation think about that more than 10 years of operation and secret never made a single concrete difference these programs mass surveillance is not about public safety it is not about terrorism it is about power it is about economic espionage it is about diplomatic manipulation and it is about social influence it is about understanding the actions of everyone in the world as carefully as they can no matter who they are no matter how innocent their life final question has to do with the Fourth Amendment we have it today because mr. Adams and others wanted to keep the British out of their homes and their horse carriages what would mr. Adams and the founders make of the reach of the government in your view into our lives given its humble beginnings I think if any of the founders of this country looked around today they would be shocked by the kind of rhetoric they hear and they would be shocked by the kind of activities of government they see if you read the Bill of Rights something that struck me when I was writing about it and in this book was that fully half of the first ten amendments are explicitly making the work of government harder they're making life for law enforcement officials harder and all of the founding fathers thought that was a good idea because they recognized the more efficient a government is the more dangerous it is we want a government always that is not too efficient we want a government always that is just efficient enough because government holds extraordinary power in our lives we want government always to be using their powers in a way that is only necessary and proportionate to the threat presented by whoever it is that they're investigating when the government is getting by by the skin of their teeth the people are free right the government should be afraid of the people people shouldn't be afraid of the government one of the ironies about the founding fathers for those who are skeptical of me which is fair again I don't want you to trust me and I want you to doubt me I want you to question me but I want you to look at the facts I want you to look beyond how you feel in the moment how we all feel in the moment and see what these stories said in 2013 see that the courts of the United States where I'm being charged as a criminal said that the government itself was engaged in criminal activity look at these things and then remember the people who founded this country were called traitors the signing the writing of the Declaration of Independence was an outrageous act of treason it was criminal but it was also right the question whether or not I broke the law is less difficult and less interesting than whether you think what I did was right or wrong what is legal is not always the same as what is more final prediction then we'll let you go nightclubbing and that is do you predict do you predict you will at some point live out your life and die in the United States I think I will return when we look at the kind of things that we're being said about me in 2013 the kind of hostility I face the kind of accusations I faced from the most senior officials in government and we look at the world today yes there are many still who don't like me but far far fewer because we have seen that all the harms that they alleged over the course of these years never came to pass they were never substantiated because they don't exist but the benefits are becoming more clear with each passing year the question that I think people have to answer whether you like me as person or not right whether you agree with how I did what I did whether you agree with the work of the journalists who decided what the public should know in order to cast their votes today you know the government broke the law today you know the United States government had broken that violated the Constitution and the rights of people in this country and around the world would you rather not know thank you and Snowden thank you very much good luck with the book that's my pleasure Brian thank you for having me hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos""""]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

| shift | msnbc",MSNBC,2BMWQZkBgsM,"[""the average American makes more than a ton of trash every year most of us seem to like this toss and go lifestyle but Lauren singer is not most of us this consumerist trash lifestyle is is very new and very modern and I think it's really a possibility to essentially revert back to lifestyle habits that existed before this disposable society became really prevalent in the last two years the 23-year old New Yorker has produced so little trash that it fits inside a 16 ounce mason jar I see the jar over there you might need to go to the second jar soon no no there's that's air there's definitely room in there Lauren is at the forefront of a small but growing movement of people who strive to live with zero waste to find out how they do it I recently met Lauren at her Brooklyn apartment my way here I was like I was like this better be legit I was like I'm gonna be sniffing at if it's not but now I'm totally convinced like there's new trash can to the matter ya know that is like my ex-boyfriends biggest thing he's like Lauren you have to have a trash can in the bathroom I was like no how do you define trash for me trash is anything that ends up in a landfill or is discarded with no intention of being reused or recycled everything from gum to putting a mattress on the side of the street what are people most curious about I think people are really curious about like the more intimate things like condoms and periods and toilet paper I mean those are the questions I get the most so let's quickly break down the lifestyle a little bit straw us I use stainless steel straws cups I'll bring a mason jar paper towels paper products I used cotton napkins to clean my home I still use toilet paper contrary to popular belief but I use recycled toilet paper and just recycle the little tube you make your own deodorant mm-hmm cleaning products cleaning products I make all my own cleaning products condoms and feminine hygiene condoms are actually one form of trash that I do produce and the as far as feminine care I use something called a menstrual cup which is essentially a silicone cup and you just basically wash it out to show off some of her tricks for zero-waste living Lauren took me shopping the Lauren where are we right now we're at integral yoga natural foods which is where I buy a lot of my bulk products and you buy a lot of products here but when I look around I see a lot of things you can't buy like things I love like these cookies there are also so many things that I can buy let's take a look around so this is my main aisle right here so they have everything you have coffee beans and tons of different types of pasta Wow and then we can do some vegetables or even some spices I like to use this in pasta so I take from the plastic jar and I put it in the glass one as well it smells really good what's amazing yeah I love it so the reason I prefer shopping at the farmers market again is because of like bold produce stickers on every can we just have a moment for the stickers who puts these stickers on so this drives me nuts and this has to go into my trash jar which is really frustrating feels like I'm running away from home or something we can get juice too or smoothie a few ones yeah can I do the morning sunshine smoothie with a base of apple but can you do it and this and then the same with caves whatever he wants also in the mason jar yeah I guess I'll have the same thing thank you yeah are you sure do you know what's in it No oh how can you not use these yeah thanks maybe you can you can you reuse that one there cool perfect see but you have to be on it you got to be sharp oh very good yeah okay so now I finished mine because it was credibly good and I have an overwhelming urge to toss it I'll grab this done no leakage and we can shave one of these guys all right thank you I feel bad this may unit carrying around my straw we headed back to her place to try the results of our shopping trip mushrooms yeah something exploded this fool so even here like you can see as we start cutting things that like all of this would have been garbage we weren't composting it and composting is just a nice word for letting it rot somewhere right exactly yeah and turning back into soil when I transitioned to this lifestyle I found that I was eating so much better and I was feeling better and I felt better when I woke up sure this sound isn't the most appetizing very like Dane Cook macaroni and cheese if you've ever seen that but there was still a lot I didn't understand when did you become somebody who was even conscious of the environment I've always loved nature I've always gotten you know really excited about being outside and seeing pretty sunsets you know the whole field help us understand how you go from oh that's a pretty sunset to I'm no longer under producing any crash in my adult life there was a girl in one of my classes that would bring this plastic bag with a plastic clamshell full of food in a plastic drink bottle and a plastic fork and knife and I would watch her throw it in the garbage class after class and I would get totally frustrated and then one day after class when I was feeling kind of upset I went home to make dinner and I opened my fridge and I saw that everything that I had was packaged in plastic I was getting so mad at this girl and I'm that girl - I was producing so much trash I kind of made a decision there to just go for it zero waste life recently Lauren turned her garbage free lifestyle into a business she launched the simply to make products for sustainable living but there are some bits of garbage even Lauren can't avoid every company has an origin story and as you say yours is bound up with the lifestyle that you started and a lot of that lifestyle is represented in that little glass container yes what are we looking at here yeah this is my this is my jar of trash from the past two years two years of trash two years of trash do you want to take a look yeah let's dump it out so as a rule of thumb if it rots you can compost it yeah it's not the most catchy phrase but yeah I mean we can even separate it out this is today's contribution I'm sorry about that Lauren I really am so there really isn't anything here that's not plastic based this is for the inside of vitamins just to keep them fresh my dreaded bar straws band-aids plastic gift wrap this one guy was super adamant about me having a wristband the little plastic thingies that connect pricetags to a piece of clothing there's so many of these things that are not recyclable and so where do they end up like the ocean finally it was tasting time do you want to serve it up oh okay this is like one of my favorites Lauren this is great thank you very much for introducing us trash free lifestyle thanks for being good sucia it seems very doable yeah I'm sad totally do not I'm home you did it and you were not you're not the radical I made you out to be""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

75,,Boeing's Starliner Launch to the International Space Station,"Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft launched aboard an Atlas V rocket on an Orbital Flight Test at 6:36 a.m. EST, Friday, Dec. 20, 2019. The spacecraft had an off-nominal orbit insertion, but was placed in a safe orbit and configuration and landed at White Sands, New Mexico on Dec. 22. Watch the landing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzNH...",NASA,PIDytLL734A,"[""S KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IN FLORIDA. I AM MARIE LEWIS WITH NASA PUBLIC AFFAIRS. >> AND I AM JOSH BEAR WITH BOEING COMMUNICATIONS, STARLINER IS NEARLY READY FOR UNCREWED ORBITAL FLIGHT TEST YOU CAN SEE IT OVER OUR SHOULDERS ON THE TEST PAD. IT IS A LITTLE WINDY BUT THAT WON'T STOP LIFTOFF FOR 636 EASTERN TIME. LET'S LOOK AT THE PAD. GROUND CREWS ARE CURRENTLY WRAPPING UP OPERATIONS IN THE WHITE ROOM AND I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO ABOUT 4:34 A.M. THIS MORNING, THAT'S WHEN THEY ACTUALLY CLOSED THE HATCH INSIDE THE WHITE ROOM AND SHOULD HAVE SOME VIDEO OF THEM WRAPPING UP THAT OPERATION >> >> THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU SEE IT. NOW PAD TEAM IS ACTUALLY RUNNING ABOUT 45 MINUTES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, WHICH IS REALLY AWESOME ON THEIR FIRST TIME DOING THIS. >> YES. REMARKABLE BECAUSE IN IS THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE DOING IT FOR REAL. IT IS -- IT WAS SO COOL. I MEAN THIS VIDEO YOU ARE SEEING WAS ITTLE BITARLIER THIS MORNING LIKE YOU SAID THEY HAD A SCHEDULE SO ALREADY LEFT THE WHITE ROOM, BUT EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GOOD AND THERE IS NO CREW FLYING TODAY BUT TEAMS OPERATING JUST AS IF AS THOUGHTS ON BOARD AND NOW IS A LIVE VIEW DISWRIEVMENT CREW STILL UP THERE ON THE TOWER AND WERE, AS WE GET CLOSER TO LAUNCH WE WILL SEE THE WHITE ROOM AND THE CREW ACCESS ARM START TO SWING AWAY FROM STARLINER IN PREPARING FOR LIFTOFF, BUT THERE THEY ARE MAKING THOSE FINAL PRESENTATIONS TO LEAVE THE PAD. >> NOW THIS UNCREWED TEST SNRIGHT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO PROVE CAN SAFELY FLY ASTRONAUTS TO THE ICE ISS. >> THIS IS A HUGE CREW FOR THE ENTIRE LAUNCH ALLIANCE TEAM. SINCE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ENDED WE ALL HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO RETURN HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT DEEBILITY THE UNITED STATES. WE CALL THIS EFFORT NASA'S MMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM. IT IS A PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE WITH BOEING AND SPACE-X AND TODAY IS STARLINER'S BIG DEBUT. >> AND OUR GOAL IS FOR EVERYONE WATCHING TODAY TO SEE A MISSION AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO A CREWED FLIGHT AND COLLECT THE MOUNTAINS OF DATA WE CAN ONLY LEARN FROM FLYING. >> IT ALSO THE FIRST TIME OUR MISSION TEAMS HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT STARLINER THROUGH ITS PACES. WE ALL HAVE BEEN PRACTICING BUT NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE CONTROL ROOM IT IS GAME DAY. >> WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO SHOW YOU HOW THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER. TEAMS FROM NASA, BOEING ARE ALL OF HAVE TO BE IN LOCKSTEP TO BE SUCCESSFULDAY. WE ALL HAVE PEOPLE SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY SITTING ON CONSOLES. WE HAVE THREE CONTROL ROOMS HERE IN FLORIDA, UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE ATLAS SPACEFLIGHT OPERATION CENTER IS ON CAPE CANAVERAL. THE BOEING MISSION CONTROL CENTER IS JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM US HERE ATENNEDY AND NASA'S EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER IS ACTIVATED READY TO RESPOND AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. THEN IN HOUSTON, AT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER THE SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM IS FOLLOWING THE MISSION CLOSELY AS WELL. >> AND STARLINER'S MISSION CONTROL IS JUST DOWN THE HALL FROM THAT SPACE STAT CONTROL ROM, WHERE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE ACTUALLY COMMANDING THE VEHICLE RIGHT NOW AND FINALLY ULA HAS TEAMS IN DENVER MONITORING. >> SO WE WANT TO CHECK IN FIRST WITH THE AT LAS LAUNCH CONTROL TEAM, JUST A FEW MILES AWAY WHERE FROM WHERE WE ARE SIFTING IN FLORIDA AND THEIR JOB IS TO KE S THE ROCKET STAYS HEALTHY RIGHT NOW UP TO AND DURING LAUNCH SWRENCHT UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE MONITORING THE ACTIVITIES OVER THERE. DYLAN, LOU THE ROCKETS DO? >> THINGS ARE GREAT THIS MORNING. IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GOOD MORNING AS YOU SEE THE .. THEY ROLLED OUT TO THE PAD A DAY AGO AND TEAMS HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER MIGHT TO PREPARE THE VEHICLE FOR LAUNCH. ALL OF THE PROPELLENT TANKS ARE LOADED THAN STABLE TOPPING WHILE THE CREWS FINISH THEIR FINAL CARGO ON THE STARLINER AND I UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED NOW ANDE TEAM IS STTING TO CLOSE OUT THE WHITE ROOM FOR OPERATIONS TODAY. THIS IS A BIG DAY FOR US. THIS IS A RETURN OF ATLAS TO ITS HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT HERITAGE. THE FIRST U.S. ASTRONAUT TO ORBIT THE EARTH WAS JOHN GLENN, LAUNCHED ON ATLAS JUST UP THE ROAD INPLEX 14 IN FEBY OF 1962 SO WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT GETTING ATLAS TO THE HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT BUSINESS. >> IT IS ALSO A RETURN TO SERVICE OF OUR DUAL ENGINE CONFIGURATION OF CENTAUR, THE DUAL ENGINE CENTAUR IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE THE AMOUNT OF THRUST AND THE TYPE FLIGHT PROFILE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GIVE A STARLINER A SAFE AND SMOOTH RIDE TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> ALSO ON CENTAUR A SUPPLEMENTAL TELEMETRY SYSTEM IT EVALUATES ALL OF THE DATA ON THE VEHICLE TO ENSURE THE RIDE IS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FORS WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THAT WE TAKE SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY, THE FOREFRONT OF EVERYTHING DO WE AND ADDING THE EMERGENCY DETECTION CENTER TO CENTAUR IS ONE MORE WAY WE CAN ASSURE THE ASTRONAUTS GET THE SAFEST LAUNCH POSSIBLE WHEN IT GETS TIME TO LAUNCH THOSE ON THE NEXT MISSION MISSION. ATOP THE CENTAUR IS IT BASICALLY HOLDS THE STAR LINE TORE CENTAUR AND ALONG WITH THAT IS AN AERO SKIRT HELPS ENHANCE THE AIR STABILITY OF THE FLIGHT. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT TESTING THE ROCKET BUT AN OPUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURES WE COME TO LOAD CREW ON THE SPACECRAFT AND WORKING ON THAT THIS MORNING. SO FOR NOW IN, THE CREW IS ON THE ACCESS TOWER, THEY ARE CLOSING OUT THE WHITE ROOM, AS I UNDERSTAND THE THEME IS WRAPPED UP IN THE CAPSULE, YOU SHOWED THAT VIDEO A FEW MINUTES AGO OF THE HATCH CLOSURE. OUR TEAM IS TAKING OVER AND ACCESSING THE WHITE ROOM AND TOWER FOR LAUNCH. THAT'S IT FOR THE UPDATE. AND BACK TO YOU. >> THANKS, DYLAN. >> IF YOU REMEMBER SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCHES YOU MAY RECALL THERE WERE FEWER CONTROL ROOMS BUT IS A WHOLE NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS AND THAT'S REALLY THE WHOLE POINT OF THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM. >> EXACTLY. YOU HAVE A COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT LAUNCHING ON A COMMERCIAL ROCKET STLEVMENT THEIR OWN CONTROL ROOMS AND NASA IS WATCHING IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS MAKING THE RIGHT CALLS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN CREWS ARE ON BOARD. >> LET'S LEARN MORE ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL VEHIC ON THE PAD BEHIND US TODAY. FIRST IS THE ATLAS V ROCKET THAT IS MADE AND OPERATED BY UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE, A WORKHORSE ROCKET WITH 80 SUCCESSFUL MISSIONS TO DATE. THIS IS A SPECIAL VERSION OF AFT LAS MADE JUST FOR STARLINER, ULA CALLS IT N TUTU. >> STANDS FOR NO PAYLOAD BEARING TWO ROCKET MOTORS AND DUAL ENGINE CENTAUR STAGE, FIRST FOR THE ATLAS V, THIS IS BOEING'S CST-100 STARLINER COMES IN TWO MAIN SECTIONS A CREW MODULE AND SERVICE MODULE. THE CREW MODULE IS WHERE THE ASTRAUTS WOULD BE, REUSABLE UP NO 10 TIMES AND OFFERS LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATIVE LANDING SYSTEM USING PARACHUTES AND AIR BAGS, THAT MAKES IT THE FIRST CAPSULE ABLE TO LAND ON LAND. IT HOUSES MOST OF THE PROPULSION SYSTEMS, INCLUD THE ONRBIT MANEUVERING THRUSTERS AND ABORT MOTORS AND HAVE A HIGH EFFICIENCY SOLAR ARRAY ON THE BOTTOM THAT COVERS A MICROMETEORITE AND DEBRIS FIELD. >> BETWEEN CHECK ON THOUSAND SPACE CRAFT IS DOING AND WE HAPPEN NO HAVE ONE OF THE ENGINEERS TORY COMPETENT DRAT AT THIS. >> SHE IS MONITORING THE LAUNCH TEAM THERE FOR US. >> TORY, HOW ARE THINGS GOING ON THE FIRST MISSION. >> GOOD MORNING, JOSH AND NOR I ARE. EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT HERE IN THE BMCC, AS YOU SAID THIS IS THE BOEING MISSION CONTROL CENT THE HEART OF STARLINER, WHILE WE ARE ON THE GROUND, WHILE WE ARE DOING LAUNCH OPERATIONS -- OPERATIONS AND WE WILL TRANSITION CONTROL OVER TO HOUSTON. HERE IN FLORIDA WE ARE JUST SUPER EXCITED, AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TIED IN TO THEIR CONSO HERE. NOW WE HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TEAMS IN THIS CONTROL ROOM, NOT ONLY NASA TEAMS AND BOEING TEAMS WORKING TOGETHER, BUT ANALYSTS ALSO LOOKING AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SUBSYSTEMS, INCLUDING THERMAL, PROPULSION, ANYTHING THAT SPACECRAFT NEEDS TO CONTINUE ON ITS MISSION TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. SO LOOKING BACK AT THE ROCKET NOW, YOU SEE THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PAD TEAM, GLEAN PAD TEAM BECAUSE JOINT ELA AND, ULA AND BOEING TEAM AND THIS IS THEOM SECOND TIME WE HAD PEOPLE NEAR A FUELED ATLAS V SO WHEN YOU SAW THAT HATCH CLOSURE AND THAT WHITE ROOM CLEAROUT JUST A FEW MINUTES HAG IT WAS ONLY THE SECOND NAME HISTORY WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE THIS CLOSE TO A FUEL. THE FIRST TIM WAS DURING OUR WET DREETAILER FEW WEEKS AGO. THE WET DRESS REHEARSAL IS WHERE WE FUEL VEHICLE AND WE DO EVERYTHING, FOLLOW ALL OF OUR PROCEDURES EXCEPT FOR LAUNCH. NOW TODAY WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO FOLLOW ALL OF OUR PROCEDURES AND LAUNCH SO IT IS A REALLY EXCITING DAY AND THIS PAD TEAM WE ARE SEEING HERE IN THE WHITE ROOM ARE JUST A HAUL MARK OF HUMAN SPAIFS FLIGHT, HAVING PEOPLE AND BEING ABLE TO LOAD PEOPLE AT THE LAST MINUTE WILL BE REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR OUR CREWED FLIGHTS LATER ON AND THIS ORBITAL FLIGHT TEST WE DO DOESN'T HAVEEW ON IT BUT LY PRACTICING LIKE WE WOULD TO MAKE SURE WE DO, THAT WE ARE SAFE AND READY WHEN WE DO HAVE CREW ON BOARD NEXT TIME. SO LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER LOOK AT THE PAD TEAM. MELANIE WEB SEARCH THE PAD TEAM LEADER. SHE IS THE FIRST FEMALE P TEAM LEAD. MELANIE HAS WORKED FOR MULTIPLE YEARS ON THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM BUT BEFORE THAT HE IS WORKED ON ISS, SHE KNOWS NOT ONLY AMOUNT OUR VEHICLE BUT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE GOING AND A LOT ABOUT THE ISS ICE AS WELL. BUT MELANIE IS THE CREW AND CARGO L AND SHE HA BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE SUPERIOR OF THE CAPSULE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO SHE WAS INVOLVED WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING IN THERE AND NOW AND NOW SHE HAS DESIGNED THE ENTIRETY OF THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND LED THE TEAM TO CLOSE IT OUT. SO THAT IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT IS A GOOD DAY FOR HER AND GREAT DAY FOR THE TEAM AS THEY CLEAR OUT OF THE TOWERS. SO BACK TO YOU, JOSH AND MARIE. >> THANKS A LOT, TORY. GOOD NEWS THAT STARLINER IS LOOKING GREAT FOR LAUNCHES. THE FIRST TIME YOU DOING EVERYTHING THERE IS ELEMENT OFFICE UNKNOWN BUT GREAT NEWS FROM THE CONTROL ROOM. LET'S LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ONTROL ROOMSND WHO IS LEADING THE TEAMS IN THE STARLINER CONTROL ROOMS TODAY. IN THE BMCC, STARLINER'S FIRST LAUNCH CONDUCTOR IS LEWIS AT ECONOMY SON. >> >> ATCHISON AND ACTUALLY MADE A FEW GHUTS THE ASTNAUT HIMSELF. HE OVER HELPS THE TEAMWORK THROUGH ANY ISSUES THAT COME UP IN THE COUNTDOWN. HIS COUNTERPART IN MISSION CONTROL SHOWS RICHARD JONES, RICHARD IS A VETERAN NASA FLIGHT DIRECTOR ASSIGNED STARLINER. ON THIS UNCREWED FLIGHT HIS SEEM LETELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMANDING AND CONTROLLING STARLINER, KNOWN AS FLIGHT IN THE CONTROL ROOM HE MAKES EVERY CRITICAL DECISION DURING LAUNCH AND ASCENT AND HAND OFF TO ANOTHER FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM FOR ORBITAL OPERATIONS BUT HE WILL BE BACK FOR LANDING. >> NOW THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE TO BE PERFECTLY SYNC BEFORE LAUNCH AND DURING FLIGHT BMC TRANSITIONS TO KIND OF A BACK ROOM MISSION SUPPORT ROOM AND STAY ON CONSOLE 24/7 THROUGH FLIGHT AND HELP THE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS IN HOUSTON WORK THROUGH ANY ISSUES IF THEY DO COME UP. >> THAT'S RIGHT. WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH RICHARD JONES AND HIS TEAM ATARLINER MISSION CONL OVER IN HOUSTON. THERE WE HAVE NASA'S RANDY DEAN AND BOEING'S STEVE OF KEEPING THANS ON THE PROCESS. HI, STEVE AND BRANDY. >> GOOD MORNING. WELCOME TO STARLINER MISSION CONTROL IN HOUSTON. I AM STEVE FROM BOEING COMMUNICATIONS. >> AND I AND BRANDY TEEN FROM NASA PUBLIC AFFAIRS. >> THIS IS WHERE RICHARD JONES AND HIS TREATMENT WATCHING CLOSELY OVER ALL OF THE SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS OF STARLINER THIS MORNING. LAUNCH IS TIMED TO PUT THE STARLINER ON A PRECISE PATH, IT  GOING -- TIMWHEN THE CH SITE THERE AT CAPE CANAVERAL LINES UP WITH THE 51.6-DEGREE ORBITAL PLANE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION THAT'S WHEN ATLAS V WILL LIFT OFF AND PUT STARLINER RIGHT ON THE COURSE IT NEEDS TO CASE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> AND SPEAKING OF THE INTERNATIONAL E STATION, JUST DOWN HALL HERE IN MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM WATCHING ON THE SPACE STATION SYSTEMS AND MAKING SURE IT IS READY FOR THE STARLINER TO ARRIVE TOMORROW. THAT TEAM IS LED BY FLIGHT DIRECTOR'D MAN AND GETTING TO PULL HIS OWN TEAM THEY ARE READY FOR TODAY'S LAUNCH AND BE ON CONSOLE AGAIN TOMORROW FOR THAT RENDEZVOUS. ALL OF THAT IS CULMINATION OF YEARS OF PREPARATION FOR THE ISS ICE AND IT IS GOING TO BE POISED AND READY TO SEE THE STARLINER IN SPACE TOMORROW. WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS IN HOUSTONUT RIGHT NOW WE WILL GO BACK TO FLORIDA. >> THANKS, RANDY AND STEVE. GOOD NEWS FROM ALL OF THE CONTROL ROOMS. THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD FOR LAUNCH. >> GREAT NEWS FOR AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THE NASA BOEING PARTNERSHIP THAT WILL HELP COMMERCIAL LIES COMMERCIAL LIES. >> COMMERCIALIZE. >> WE ARE JOINED BY NASA ADMINISTRATION JIM BRIDENSTINE NEARBY TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE EXCITING THINGS WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, HI, DARRELL .. HI MARIE AND JOSH, THAT'S RIGHT WE ARE HERE AT THE TOP OF THE OSB BUILDING A FEW FEET FROM WHERE YOU OF A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE ROCKET AND JIM BRIDENSTINE IS HERE, SIMPLY PUT THE BIG BOSS OVER ALL OF NASA. >> OR JUST JIM. >> OR JUST JIM. THANK YOU FOR THAT. >> THANK YOU. >> YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR THE WEEK. >> YES. >> WHAT ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW TO THE EXCITEMENT AIF THE BUILDS UP TO THIS LAUNCH? >> I WILL TELL YOU TO LEVEL OF ENERGY HERE IS REALLY AMAZING. AND THIS IS NOT NEW NO THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, BUT CERTAINLY IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE HAVE FLOWN HUMANS INTO SPACE AND THERE IS ONE OF THESE TWRUNLTS WE ARE MEETING A CRITICAL MTONE, END TO END TEST OF ONE OF OUR COMMERCIAL CREW VEHICLES. I WILL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, I WAS IN THE ORLANDO AREA YEARS AGO WHEN THE SHUTTLES WERE GETTING READY TO RETIRE AND THE CONSTELLATION PROGRAM WAS STANDING UP AND IT GOT CANCELED. THIS -- THE KENNEDYPACE CENTER IS BACK. THE COMMERCIAL PARTNERS ARE DOING AMAZING THINGS. THERE IS AN ENERGY HERE THAT IS JUST PALPABLE SO IT FEELS REALLY GOOD TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW. >> IT WAS A TOUGH TIME. >> YES. >> AT THE TIME OF THE SHUTTLE INDEED AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE JUST GETTING READY TO YOU ARE TURN THE CORNER. THE BIG QUESTION EVERYON WANTS TO KNOW, WHEN WILL ASTRONAUTS BE RIDING ON ONE OF THESE SPACECRAFT? >> SO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL CREW PROVIDERS, SPACE-X AND BOEING AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL HAVE IN THE FIRST PART OF 2020 AT LEAST ONE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH WITH ASTRONAUTS. I WOULD SAY THAT -- I AM ACTUALLY CONFIDENT WE WILL HAVE TWO PARTNERS IN THE FIRST PART OF 2020. BUT, YOU KNOW, REMEMBER WHAT THE GOAL IS. THE GOAL IS TO HAVE TWO INDEPENDENT SOLUTIONS SO THAT IF ONE HAS A SETBACK THE OTHER CAN MOVE FORWARD AND SO THAT IS WHY WE HAVE DISSIMILAR REDUNDANCY SO THIS INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS SO I WOULD SAY FIRST PART OF 20 STWENT WHAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO. >> YOU WERE TELLING ME AS A BACKUP YOU SOUGHT TO PURCHASE SEATS ON SOYUZ. >> WHY. >> YES. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> WHY IS THAT? HAVE A GAP ON AMERICANS IN THE'T INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA HAS BEEN STRONG SINCE 1975, WE WANT TO KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN COMMERCIAL SCREW SUCCESSFUL WE WE WANT AMERICANS LAUNCHING ON SOYU ROCKETS AND RUSSIA LAUNCHING ON COMMERCIAL ROCKETS. WE WANT IT STRONG. HALF OF THIS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS RUSSIANS SO IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE MAINTAIN THIS PARTNERSHIP THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. >> ALL RIGHT, JIM, THANKS FOR ENJOY US AND ENJOY THE LAUNCH TODAY. >> THANK YOU. >> JH AND MARIE, WE WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU. >> THANKS, DARRELL AND JIM. THE LAST TIME WE LAUNCHED ASTRONAUTS FROM THE UNITED STATES WAS IN 2011. AND TO RESTORE THAT CAPABILITY AS YOU HEARD THEM JUST TALKING ABOUT NAAH SAP TURNED TO PRIVATE COMPANIES LIKE BOEING TO PROVIDE THE RIDE AND NASA BUYS THE TICKET, IF YOU WILL, FOR OUR >> THAT'S RIGHT. THIS PARTNERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT OPENING UP ON OR ABOUT AND FOSTERING NEW CAPABILITIES IN COMMERCIAL HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT. >> STAND BY FOR .. PRESENT FOR FLIGHT, 5, 4. >> THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM IS TO RETURN TO OUR NATION THE CAPABILITY TO FLY OUR ASTRONAUTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> 3, 2, 1. >> THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT GOING SPACE THAT ALWAYS HAS BEEN SPECIAL, SO HERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF CRAFT. >> LIFTOFF. # THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY, IT WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MORE ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE AND RTHER OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR KNOWE IN A MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. >> THE FACT WE ARE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY ALLOWS US TO FULFILL THAT MISSION, TO BE EXPLORERS BECAUSE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THERE IS A LARGER GROUP OF US THAT ARE DREAMING POTENTIALLY WE COULD HAVE A ARRIVED SOME DAY AND BE WORKING IN SPACE. >> FOLKS ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL WATCH THIS BECAUSE WE ARE INTEGRITY GREATING THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO PAVE THE WAY TO THE FUTURE. IT IS TRULY EXCITING TIME IN SPACEFLIGHT AND WE WANT YOU TO GET ONLINE IN SOCIAL MEDIA. HEAD TO BOEING DOT-COM/STARLINER WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THE TEAM AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A NEXT STEM WEBSITE. AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL GRADE LEVELS AND LEA ABOUT ALL THINGS COMMERCIAL CREWS ON THE MAIN PAGE AND SEE ALL OF THOSE ON YOUR SCREEN AND IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION YOU WANT ANSWERED THIS HOP ON TWITTER AND MAKE SURE YOU USE THE HASHTAG ASK NASA. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING GREAT QUESTIONS AND WE WANT TO TAKE ONE AND WE HAD ONE FROM MARK ON TWITTER. HE WAS ASKING WHERE STARLINER IS GOING TO LAND AFTER ALL OF THIS. >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. AS WE AHEAD EARLIER STARLINER WILL BE THE FIRST AMERICAN CREW CAPSULE THAT CAN LAND ON LAND. WE HAVE FIVE LANDING SPACES. RIHT NOW IF W STAY ON SCHEDULE FOR LANDING ON THE 28TH WHETHER HE LAND ON THE WHITE SANDS IN, SANDS MISSILE RANGE IN. >> EXAMINE. USE THE HASHTAG STARLINER AND WATCH HOW YOU ARE WATCHING TODAY'S LAUNCH. >> WE ARE LAUNCHING FROCAPE CANAVERAL LOCATED ON THE EASTERN COAST OF FLORIDA. >> AND JOINING US NOW A SPECIAL GUEST WHO HAS A VEPSED INTEREST IN WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE SUNSHINE STATE, DARRELL IS WITH US AGAIN WITH FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS. >> THAT'S RIGHT, JOSHUA. WE ARE HERE WITH GOVERNOR DESANTIS, THANKS FOR JOINING US AND TAKING TIME. >> YO HEROR THE LAUNCH AND HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A FEW DAYS, DID YOU GET A TOUR? >> WE JUST CAME FROM THE BRIEFING WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING AND IT IS JUST AN EXCITING DAY. I WOULD SAY WAKE UP BRIGHT AND EARLY BUT IT IS NOT EVEN BRIGHT OUT IT IS SO RETAILER BUT THIS IS GREAT, WE HERE IN FLORIDA ARE PROUD  OF WHAT IS GOING ON KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. WE THINK THIS IS THE CENTER OF ALL INNOVATION IN SPACE ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND THIS IS GREAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO DO THIS AND GETTING ASTRONAUTS BACK UP TO SPACE AND EVENTUALLY TO THE MOON. >> YOU RECALL THE RETIREMENT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE PRAJJE IN 2011, THAT KIND OF SHOOT SHOOK THE STATE FOR WHILE, ESPECIALLY ON THE EAST COAST. >> ESPECIALLY, JIM BRIDENSTINE, NASA ADMINISTRATOR AND I BOTH GOT ELECTED TO IN CONGRESS IN 2012. >> MY DISTRICT WAS JUST NORTH OF HERE, STARTING IN THE -- COUNTY WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORKED HERE WHO LIVED IN THE DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DISTRICT AND YOU COULD TELL, I MEAN, IT WAS, YOU KNOW, A REALLY BAD TIME FOR HERE AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SO PROUD EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON HERE. WHAT IS HAPPENING? I THINK WE ARE BACK WITH -- WITH AGEANCE NOW. IT IS EXCITINO SEE THE DIRECTION THIS IS GOING. >> YOU SEE IT TURNING A CORNER AND GET EXPHEARLG. WOULD YOU RIDE ON ONE OF THESE SPACECRAFT? >> I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVERYTHING, BUT I THINK I WOULD BE MORE OF A LIABILITY THAN ANYTHING FOR THEM SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD WANT ME ON THERE. YOU KN PEOPLE REALLY HAT THEY ARE DOING SO, YOU KNOW,. >> THEY ARE AUTOPILOTTED NOW. >> RIGHT. >> SO IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND LET US KNOW. GOVERNOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> THANK YOU. >> ENJOY THE LAUNCH. >> APPRECIATE IT. >> WE WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU GUYS. >> THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU AND DEFINITELY BACK IN A BIG WAY AND LAUNCH, WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AGAIN AT LAUNCH COMPLEX 41, STARLINER SITTING ATOP ATLAS V GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO LIFTOFF. >> AND ORBITAL FLIGHT TEST IS THE DRESS REHEARSAL FOR LAUNCHING ASTRONAUTS, INTOAG A, ASTRONAUT TO THEAN SPAS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, FERGUSON WILL JOIN NASA ASTRONAUT MIKE FINK WHO IS NO STRANGER TO THE SPACE STATION, FINK SERVED ON TWO LONG DURATION FLIGHTS AS SCIENCE OFFICER AND COMMANDER AND FLEW ON SPACE SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR'S FINAL MISSION. NICOLE MANN AND THE CREW FLIGHT TEST WILL BE HER FIRST FLIGHT TO SPACE. >> THE THREE HAVE BEEN LEARNING THE SYSTEMS AND PREPARING FOR LIVE AND WORK ABOARD THE, AGOOD BOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WHERE THEY COULD STAY UP THE CREW HAS BEEN TRAINING FOR BOTH ROUTINE AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ON THE GROUND AND IN PLIGHT. >> BUT KEEP IN MIND STARLINER IS NOT GOING TO BE EMPTY FOR THIS FLIGHT. IT IS PACKED WITH ALMOST 600 POUNDS OF NASA CARGO AND ALSO HAVE A TEST DEVICE THAT THIS RIDE WILLE LIKE FOR THEAT ASTRONAUTS. MEET ROSIE. SHE IS THE STARLINER COMMAND FORE THIS VERY FIRST MISSION. WE NAMED HER AFTER ROSIE THE RIVETER AN ICON OF, THE ROSIE THE ROCKET TEAR IS FLYING FOR EVERYONE ON OUR TEAM WHO TOOK ON  CHALLENGE OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND SAID WE CAN DO IT. THE FLIGHT IS NOT JUST SYMBOLIC, SIX TONE SENSORS WE WILL USE TO MAKE SURE FUTURE ASTRONAUTS ARE SAFE ON STARLINER. >> AND A COMPANION WITH HER. THERE IS SNOOPY, ANOTHER CHANCE TO GO TO SPACE. SNOOPY HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH NASA GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE APOLLO PROGRAM WHEN WE SENT ASTRONAUTS TO THE MOON. THIS IS THE NEXT ERA WITH COMMERCIAL CREW AND NASA'S ARTEMIS PROGRAM. HE HAS AN IMPORTANT JOB TOO AS OUR GRAVITY INDICATOR SO IN STARLINER REACHES MICROGRAVITY HE WILL START FLOATING OUT OF THAT PILOT SEAT. >> NOW ROSIE AND SKIMPY ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO NEED HELP FLYING STARLINER. THAT HELP IS GOING GOING TO COMM STARLINER'S AUTONOMOUS SPACE CENTER. BE 2 GROUND TEAMS WILL ALSO BE MONITORING AND INTERVENING IF NED NEEDED SO WE WANT TO CHECKN'T THOSE PEOPLE WHO WILL COMMAND STAR LINER FROM HERE ON EARTH. STEPHEN AND BRANDY, HOW ARE THINGS IN HOUSTON? >> THANKS, MARIE, THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG AND IN THE PRELAUNCH CHECKLIST TODAY. THE TEAM HERE IN MISSION CONTROL IS NOW RACKING 41 MES AWAY FROM LAUNCH AND WORKING THROUGH CHECKLIST. MAKING SURE THEY ARE READY TO TAKE CONTROL OF STARLINER ONCE IT DOES LIFT OFF THE LAUNCHPAD TODAY. >> WHEN IT DOES, FLIGHT DIRECTOR RICHARD JONES AND THE STARLINER MISSION CONTROL TEAM WILL FINALLY PHOTO UP TO WORK ALL THE SKILLS THEY HONED IN EXHAUSTIVE FLIGHT SIMULATION FORCE PAST MONTH AND HAVE BEEN SENDING COMMANDS TO STARLINER FOR THINGS LIKE CABIN PRESSURIZATION AND COMMUNICATION CHECKS AND AS IT LAUNCHES OFF THE SPACE PAD THIS SPACEFLIGHT SPECIALISTS WILL WATCH CAREFULLY AND MAKING COMMANDST ARE NEEDED TOEEP THE VEHICLE ON ITS PRECISE PATH TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> AND ANOTHER GROUP THAT IS KEENLY WATCHING TODAY IS OF COURSE THE ASTRONAUTS WHO ARE GOING TO MAKE THE FIRST FLIGHT ON STARLINER WHEN WE DO THIS AGAIN IN EARLY 2020. THAT IS OF COURSE NASA AS NOUGHT MIKE FIN AND NASA AS NOUGHT NICOLE MANN WALLING BOEING AS THOUGHTS CHRIS FERGUSON. THEY ARE DOWN AT THE CAPE WATCHING TODAY'S LAUNCH FROM CONTROL CENTERS BUT WE HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM A LITTLE BIT -- A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TO FIND OUT THEIR VIEWS ON THIS NEW AMERICAN CREWED SPACECRAFT. >> IN 10 OR 15 YEARS THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN JUST ONE SPACE STATION. IN FACT WE, INSTEAD OF SAYING THE SPACE STATION WE WILL SAY WHICH ONE AND WE WILL HAVE PEOPLE EVERY DAY PEOPLE, REGULAR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, EVEN PEOPLE WITH TOURS THAT CAN BOY A TICKET TO GO SEE -- GO TO THE SPACE STATION IN ORBIT AND BE MANUFACTURING NEW THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE BETTER ON PLANET EARTH AND A GREAT UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR COUNTRY, UNITED STATES TO ESTABLISH THESE INDUSTRIES, TO MAKE LIVE BETTER ON PLANET EARTH AND CONTINUE THE ENGINE OF OUR ECONOMY OF HIGH TECH. >> I DON'T THINK ASTRONAUTS -- ♪ ♪ -- IFVERYBODY WHO EVE FLEW IN SPACE BECAME INSTANTLY FAMOUS THEN WE ARE NOT MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY TO DO. SO WHEN WE GET INTO AN AIRLINER, WHO KNOWS THE NAME OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE AIRLINE? NOBODY KNOWS THE NAME OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE AIRLINER AND IF SPACEFLI IS EVER GOING TO BE AS COMMONPLACE AS WE WANT IT TO BE, ASTRONAUTS ARE JUSTIFY LOTS WHO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO SPACE. >> IT IS REALLY GOING TO BE A COMBINED EFFORT, WITH FULL COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY AND ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING SEE THE FUTURE OF SPACE EXPLORATION TO THE MOON AND THEN EVENTUALLY TO MARS. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE -- WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT TYPE OF EXPLORATION WITHOUT COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY. OF OF AMEND IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE PEOPLE, RIGHT? YOU FLOWED PEOPLE, YOU NEED IDEAS AND YOU NED FOLKS COME IN AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE COMMERCIAL COMPETITION, IT KEEPS EVERYBODY GOING AND PUSHING FORWARD TOWARDS THE GOAL. S THE AILSZ GREAT HEARING FROM THE CREW MEMBERS THEMSELVES. THEY ARE GETTING A FRONT ROW SEAT ON THIS. >> WHAT AN EXCITING FUTURE IT IS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WORK IN HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT, ESPECIALLY ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WATCHING TODAY. >> EXACTLY. BUT FIRST WE HAVE THIS CRITICAL UNCREWED FLIGHT TEST WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO LAUNCH AMERICANS FROM AMERICAN SOI AND NASA WILL HELP CERTIFY SYSTEMS TO CARRY THOSE ASTRONAUTS WE JUST HEARD FROM. WE ARE 38 MINUTES FROM LAUNCH SO WE WANT TO CHECK IN ON THIS ROCKET. DYLAN, WHAT IS THE LATEST YOU HEARING. >> THINGS ARE CONTINUING TO GO VERY WELL HERE IN THE ASOC, WE HAVE GOTTEN A REPORT THAT ALL O THE GROUND CREWS HAVE CLEARED THE CREW ACCESS TOWER AND MOVED A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PAD TO A ROADBLOCK ON THE BEACH ROAD THERE. SO THINGS ARE GOING VERY WELL HERE. WE DO HAVE A WEATHER UPDATE PLANNED IN ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES, NOT EXPECTING ANY SURPRISES THERE, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD A BREEZY PAST COUPLEF DAYS THE WEATHER CONTINUES TO BE FAVORABLE TO ARE A LAUNCH ON TIME TODAY. SO WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FINAL WEATHER REPORT. AND THE TEAM HERE IS JUST CONTINUING TO REMAIN FOCUSED BUT VERY EXCITED AND THE MOOD HERE HAS BEEN, AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY IS REALLY ELECTRIC, THE TEAM IS JUST VERY EXCITED TO BE GETTING EVER CLOSER TO LAUNCH AND WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT, HITTING THE T ZERO IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE. JOSH AND MARIE, BACK TO YOU. >> THANKS, DYLAN, I KNOW FOR YOU ALL AT ULA, SOMETHING ISN'T ALL THAT NEW, YOU HAVE MORE THAN 130 SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES UNDER YOUR BELT. THAT'S WHY BOEING CHOSE TO LAUNCH, CHOSE ATLAS TO LAUNCH STARLINER BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE DECIDING ON A LAUNCH VEHICLE ULA WAS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SPACE LAUNCH, SAFETY IS THE BIGGEST RELIABILITY. >> WHAT.  ARE THE PARAMETERS ON THE SPACE, WAS LAUNCH VEHICLE AGNOSTIC OR MOVE FROM ONE LAUNCH VEHICLE TO THE OTHER. WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DESIGN CHANGE IN EACH CRAFT. >> THE EARLY FLIGHTS TO THE STARLINER WE SELECTED THE ATLAS V BECAU OF ITS UNPARALLELED SAFETY. >> THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS IN THIS SMARKT GOING TO BE DRIVEN BY CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. >> EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SPACECRAFT AND OUR SYSTEMS HAS BEEN DESIGNED WITH THAT AS PRIMARY GOAL. >> >> ARE YOU LAW LAUNCHED NASA SCIENCE MISSIONS TO ALMOST EVERY PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM BUT IS THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE TASKED WITH LAUNCHING ASTRONAUTS. >> IT IS A VERY SPECIAL MISSION FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED AND IF THE HAS TAKEN YEARS GET HERE BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME O THE HARDK THAT HAPPENED JUST OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS TO GET THESE VEHICLES READY FOR TODAY. >> THERE YOU SEE ATLAS V BEING STACKED AT THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION FACILITY. THIS OPERATION WAS TAKING PLACE ON NOVEMBER 4TH AND THIS WAS IN PREPARATION FOR A STARLINER TO BE ROLLED OUT AND MATED ON TOP. YOU SEE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ROCKET BEING HOISTED INTO POSITION THERE. >> AND THERE IS STARLINER IN FRONT OF OUR COMEFER SHALL CREW AND, COMMERCIAL CREW AND. >> IT IS AN OLD GARAGE, ESSENTIALLY. >> AND THERE IT IS ROLLING IN FRONT OF THE ICONIC ASSEMBLY BUILDING CENTER HERE AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER.  THIS ROLLOUT WAS ON NOVEMBER 21ST AND TOOK ABOUT A SIX-MILE PATH OUT TO THE LAUNCHPAD GOAVMENT SOME BEAUTIFUL DRONES SHOTS THAT DAY. >> I LOVE THESE SHOTS. IT WAS A GORGEOUS DAY SPACECRAFT ROLLING DOWN THE BEACH AND YOU CAN ONLY SEE, A SIGHT YOU ONLY SEE HERE AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. >> THERE IT WAS GOING DOWN BEACH ROAD, TO BE PICKED PAPER CRANE AND INTEGRATED WITH THE ROCKET AND THAT ONLY REALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF HOURS. IT IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE HOW QUICK THINK TEAMS CAN WORK ON THIS. ROLLED OUT TO THE PAD FOR I KNOW TORY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE WET DRESS EARLIER THE FUELED ROCKETS. THAT WAS INTEGRATED DAY OF LAUNCH TEST FOR ALL TEAMS TO PRACTICE ONE FINAL TIME BEFORE TODAY. >> EXACTLY. THERE IT IS ROLLING FOR THAT TEST. >> AND MOST OF THAT VIDEO COVERS THE LAST FEW MONTHS AS WE GOT READY FOR LAUNCH BUFF IF THE REALLY DOESN'T EVEN SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF ALL THE HARD WORK THAT IT HAS TAKEN BY SO MANY FOAM GET STARLINER READY FOR TODAY. >> BUT WE ARE FINALLY HERE TODAY SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE BMCC TO SEE HOW STARLINER IS DOING. TORY OUR LAUNCH TEAM, ARE THEY TRACKING ANY ISSUES RIGHT NOW. >> HI, JOSH. HERE IN THE BMCC WE ARE NOT TRACK ANY ISSUES. IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS SET AND READY FOR A GOOD AND CLEAN LAUNCH HERE IN -- I CAN'T SEE -- NOW, YOU SEE THE PEOPLE THE ROOM HERE ARE ALL REALLY TIED IN TO DATA COMING IN .. AND ALL OF THESE TEAMS ARE REALLY LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF DAFT THAT IS COMING OFF THE ROCKET IN REAL-TIME RIGHT NOW ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE SEE IS WELL INSIDE AND IS FOR A SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT. >> EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GREAT HERE IN THE BMCC SO BACK TO YOU, JOSH AND MARIE. >> ALL RIGHT, THANKS A LOT, TORY. WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A CLOSER LOOK OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS OF ARE STARLINER AND ATLAS V OVER ON SPACE LAUNCH COMPLEX 41. YOU SEE RIGHT BEHIND US. >> YES. WE ARE ABOUT 33 MINUTES AWAY FROM LAUNCH SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT LAUNCH -- STARLINER'S MISSION WILL LOOK LIKE TODAY. >> MISSION STARTS AT T MINUS ZERO WITH LIFTOFF AFTER THE ATLAS V BOOSTER ENGINES GO TO LIGHT AND SEND THE VEHICLE SKYWARD. SOON AFTER AT T PLUS 12 SECONDS THE ROCKET BEGS TO ROLL TO HELP WITH ACCELERATION FORCES. MAX Q STARTS AT 41 SECONDS, THAT'S ALSO KNOWN AS MAX AERODYNAMIC PRESSURE, A CRITICAL TIME WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE COUR FORCE TONS ROCKET ARE THE HIGHEST 3 REACH. AT ONE MINUTE, 35 SECOND IT IS TWO SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS RUN OUT OF FUEL AND BURN OUT, LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER AT PLUS 222 THEY SEPARATE FROM THE BOOSTER. THE MAIN ENGINE KEEPS BURNING FOR ALMOST TWO MORE MINUTES, THEN AT PLUS 429 BOOSTER ENGINE CUTOFF OR BECO. >> THE BOSTONNERS SEPARATES AND SIX SECONDS AFTER THAT SO DOES THE ASCENT COVER ON TOP OF Z AT PLUS FOUR MINUTES, 45 SECONDS, THE CENTAUR UPPER STAGE IGNITES PUSHING STARLINER TO NEAR ORBITAL SPEEDS. >> THEN AT PLUS 5:05 THE IT JETSONS AND A STARLINER AND CENTAUR ARE FREE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND NO LONGER NEED AERODYNAMIC SUPPORT. >> AFTER A LONG SIX PLUS MINUTE PUSH FROM CENTAUR MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF OR MICO HAPPENS AT 11:54, THEN WHEN CENTAUR SUCCESSFULLY SEPARATES, ALMOST 15 MINUTES AFTER LAUNCH, THE ROCKET'S JOB QUITE IN ON OR ABOUT YET.NOT AFTER A LONG 16 ORBIT COAST. >> IGNITES FOUR OF THE ENGINES FOR ORBITAL ASSERTION BURN AND AS CENT PROFILE IS COMPLETE. IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE AN EXITING ASSET BUT BEFORE THE ROCKET IS DECLAREDEADY FOR LAUNCH, SOME TEAMS HAVE TO REPORT READINESS IN SOME UPCOMING POLLS. >> RIGHT BEFORE THE LAUNCH VEHICLE POLL, BOTH TEAMS IN FLORIDA AND HOUSTON ARE PREPARING TO REPORT OUT SO LET'S GO BACK TO HOUSTON AND SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING, STEVE, SOMEHOW MISSION CONTROL? >>HANK YOU, JOSH. EVERYTHING LOOKS EXCITING HERE IN FLORIDA. RICHARD JONES WILL PULL HIS TEAM IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. THE FINAL CHANCE FOR HIM TO GET A GO, NO GO FROM HIS TEAM OF MISSION SPECIALISTS AND USE THAT POLL TO INFORM HIS OWN G NO GO DECISION FOR THE LAUNCH CONDUCTOR'S POLL LATER THAT WILL SET THE CYCLE COME OUT OF TERMINAL COUNT. >> AND MEANWHILE IN SPACE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SCREW STANDING BY FOR TODAY'S LAUNCH AS WELL. THEY ARE COMMANDING I, FROM THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY ESA,A FLIGHT ENGINEER CHRISTIE AND A HALF COOK, JESSICA MEIR AND ANDREW MORGAN AND ALSO, ALEX, THEY ARE ALL GOING TO BE WAITING ON BOARD THE SPACE STATION FOR STARLINER'S ARRIVAL TOMORROW BUT MERE AND COOK HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE FLAY THAT RONALD VIEW. THEY WILL BE SENDING COMMANDS TO THE STARLINER VEHICLE HELPING WITH SOME OF THE DEMOCRAT INVESTIGATIONS TO MAKE SURE IT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO RENDEZVOUS SAFELY. SO THIS WILL BE THE NEXT MAJOR MILESTONE AS WE COUNT DOWN TOWARDS 20 YEARS OF CONTINUOUS HUMAN PRESENCE IN SPACE. THE ICE ISS SPACE STATION, FOOTBALL FOLD SIZED MILLION POUND LABORATORY ANYTHING AROUND PLANET EARTH AT 17,500 MILLS PER HOUR. IT IS OUR HOME IN LOW EH ORBIT ANDO EXPLORING THE FAR REACHES OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. A PLACE TO LEARN WHAT WHAT IT TS TO LIVE, TO WORKS, TO WORK, TO THRIVE IN SPACE.

E THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, IT WENT FROM THE DRAWING BOARDO LIFTOFF WHEN THE FIRST PIECE FLEW INTO SPACE IN 1998. THAT KICKED OFF OVER A DECADE OF CONSTRUCTION, HAULING THE STATION TO ON OR ABOUT PIECE BY PIECE ON NASA'S SPACE SHUTTLE AND RUSSIAN ROCKETS, AFTER THE FIRST CREW ARRIVED IN NOVEMBER OF 2000 WE STARTED AN UNBROKEN STRANGE OF HUMANS LIVING AND WORKING IN SPACE. BUILDING ON THE LEGACY OF PAST OUT POSTS LIKE SKY LAB AND MUIR, THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION GAME TRAINING GROUND FOR HUMANITY'S NEXT GREAT JOURNEY. LENING THOUSAND LIVE IN SPACE FOR EXTREME PERIODS OF TIME, BUILDING AND PERFECTING THE TECHNOLOGY NECESSARY TO EXPLORE SOLAR SYSTEM. >> IT GAVE US A SPACE ON THE DOORSTEP TO PROPER NEXT GIANT LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN AND THANKS TO THE STATION A NEW ERA IN OUTER SPACE IS UNFOLDING. >> WHAT WAS ONCE THE DOMAIN OF ONLY NATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS IS NOW POPULATE PAID GROWING SPACE FLEET FROM AMERICAN INDUSTRY. PRIVATE SPACECRAFT TO FLY CARGO AND CREW MEMBERS, NEW HABITATS AND TECHNOLOGY FOR FUTURE SPACE MISSIONS AND AN OPEN DOOR FOR COMPANIES, RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND EVEN STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO DO RESEARCH IN SPACE THAT HAVE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE. ALL LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A ROBUST ANY SPACE. IN HAVE BEEN THOUSAND SHANLDZ OF EXPERIMENTS HUNDREDS OF SPACEWALKS AND END LESS CHALLENGES AND SUCCESSES ALL DONE BY HUMANS HAILING FROM COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE AS P INEFFECTIVE WHEN WE COME TOGETHER TO DO THE THINGS THAT ARE HARD. >> AND YOU REALLY GET AN IDEA FROM THAT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH AND THE BENEFIT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, EVERY DAY ASTRONAUTS LIVING UP THERE AREOING, OR DOING THEIR EXPERIMENT THERE IS IS NOWHERE LIKE SPICE TEST THE SYSTEMS THAT ASTRONAUTS WILL RELY ON WHEN THEY GO TO THE MOON AND ON TO MARS. AND OF COURSE BEFORE WE MAKE THOSE FLIGHTS WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE FLIGHTS, INCLUDING CARRYING A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS OF, POUNDS OF CARGO TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, INCLUDING THE FOOD, THAT WILL GO UP AS KIND OF A CARE PACKAGE FOR CRUP THERE. ALSO TAKING UP FLAGS, COINS AND THE ILLUSTRIOUS SILVER SNOOPIES AND ONE OF THE PHRASES YOU HEAR A LOT IN HUMANCEFLIGHT IS STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS AND THAT BASICALLY REPRESENTS THE WORK THAT OUR PREDECESSORS HAVE DONE TO MAKE THIS SPACE PROGRAM SO SUCCESSFUL AND THE WORK THAT EVERYBODY PUTS IN WHEREVER DAY TO ACHIEVE THESE WONDERFUL MISSIONS. SO ITEMS LIKE I THESE, LIKE THE FLAGS ARE OFTEN USED TO COMMEMORATE AND TOKENS SUCH AS SILVER SNOOPIES GIVE US A CHANCE TO -- FOR BOEING AND NASA TO THANK WORKFORCE THAT PUTS IN EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO THESE FLIGHTS. THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S ONE MORE REASON TO BE TO GET STARLINER OFF THE GROUND TODAY SO WE CAN GET SOME OF THAT FUN CARGO BACK AFTER LANDING. IN THE MEANTIME, THOUGH, THE FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM HERE IN HOUSTON JUST GAVE RICHARD JONES THEIR GO FOR LAUNCH, SO EVERYTHING IS PROCEEDING RIGHT ON TIME AND WE ARE GOING HAND BACK NOW TO MH. >> ALL RIGHT, THANKS, STEVE AND BRANDY, IT IS SO COOL TO SEE YOU GUYS THERE IN MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON FOR WHAT WILL SOON BE CREW LAUNCHES AGAIN AND JOSH I KNOW YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE PEOPLE BEHIND SCENE, JUST HOW MANY PREPARE INVOLVED AND HOW LONG AND HARD THEY HAVE JUST POURED THEIR HEARTS AND SOU INTO THIS, I GOT CHILLS MYSELF HEARING MISSION CONTROL WAS GO, I KNOW PEOPLE SITTING ON CONSOLE, THEY ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR DATA BUT IT IS JUST SUCH AND EMOTIONAL DAY FOR THEM STILL. >> YES. WE WANT TO GO OVER TO DYLAN FOR A QUICK STATUS CHECK. HOW ARE THINGS GOING? >> WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE A VERY CLEAN COUNTDOWN HERE, THE TEAM IS WORKING, NO ISSUES, JUST A FEW MOVEMENTS AGO WE HEARD FROM OFFICER JESSICA WILLIAMS AND GOT A WEATHER REPORT THAT IS JUST ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS FROM JESSICA AND THE WEATHER TEAM OVER IN THE 45TH SPACE WING. CLEAR SKIES, WE ARE A GO ON ALL CONSTRAINTS WITH JUST A TEN PERCENT POSSIBILITY OF SURPRISE POPULATION OF GROUND WINDS BUT THE WINDS ARE WELL UNDER OUR CONSTRAINTS SO NOT LOOKING FOR ANY WEATHER ISSUES THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COUNTDOWN TODAY AS COMPARED TO COUNT DOWNS HEENGTH OF THE HOLD. GENERALLY THE FINAL HOLD IS 15 OR 20 MINUTES, THAT IS DEPENDENT ON A LAUNCH WINDOW BUT TODAY'S BUILT IN HOLD, WE ARE GOING USE FOR COMMERCIAL CREW MISSIONS IS FOUR HOURS AND DURING THAT TIME IS THE TIME WHEN THE BOEING TEAM GOES BACK OUT AND FINISHES LOADING UP THAT CARGO INTO THE STARLINER AS WELL AS THAT'S WHEN THE LAUNCH OR LOAD THE ASTRONAUTS AS WELL. THOSE ARE ALL THE PROCESSES THAT THE TEAM CHECKED OUT TODAY, OF COURSE ALL OF THAT IS WRAPPED UP AND DONE, SO THE REMAINING WORK WE HAVE AHEAD OF US HERE ARE WE ARE GOING TO BE CLOSING OUT OUR PROP HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS AND GET THOSE CONFIGURED FOR FLIGHT, THE AVIONIC FOLKS WILL MAKE SURE THE ROCKET CAN STEER APPROPRIATELY THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WITH THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS. THERE WILL BE SOME COMM CHECKS COMPLOAFTED, THE BMCC OVER AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER AND EVENTUALLY THE COMM CHECK WILL INCLUDE ASTRONAUTS AS WELL. WE WILL GET THAT CREW ACCESS ARM RETRACTED AND THEN MOVE INTO OUR FINAL POLLING FOR LAUNCH. JOSH AND MARIE THAT'S THE UPDATE FROM THE ASOC. >> THANKS, DYLAN,HAT'S REALLY ABOUT AS GOOD A FORECAST AS YOU HOPE FOR. FINGERS CROSS MOTHER NATURE CONTINUES TO COOPERATE. >> AND WE CONTINUE TO PREPARE FOR FLIGHT. NASA STEVE PAIN SPAIN ON STAND ANY THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. HE IS A GUY YO HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO CALL BUT BE GLAD HE IS THERE IF GROWVMENT IN AN EMERGENCY, STEVE WOULD COORDINATE ALL THE RESOURCES ON SITE TO MAKE SURE WE GET EVERYONE OUT SAFELY AND DENVER, THE VALOR TEAM LED BY LARS IS PREPARING FOR ASCENT.  HE IS ONLY ON CONSOLE DURING STARLINER FLIGHTS. THEY ARE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY FOR ANYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG ON HERE AND RELAY DATA TO MISSION CONTROL TO PREPARE FOR AN ABORT. STAYED JUST PRACTICE FOR THEM SINCE OUR ABORT SYSTEM IS NOT ACTIVE AND THERE IS NOT CREW ON BOARD. NOW THROUGHOUT THE SHOW WE HAVE BEEN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT STARLINER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. >> THAT'S RIGHT. AND WE WANT TO TAKE -- WE GOT A REALLY COOL PHOTO FROM A STARLINER IN SUPER FAN WATCHING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE POND IN IRELAND. OF COURSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GET UP QUITE SO EARLY BECAUSE I THINK IT ISID-MORNING THERE NOW, BUT HAYDEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING YOUR PHOTO AND PLEASE IF YOU WATCHING FOLLOW UP, USE THE HASHTAG ASK NASA AND SHOW US HOW YOU WATCHING TODAY'S LAUNCH. >> HAYDEN, I HOPE HE SEES A GOOD LAUNCH TODAY. >> AND AS MISSION TEAMS PREPARE FOR FINAL -- >> OH, SORRY WE HAVE A QUESTION. WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE ENOUGH BOEING BLUE SPACESUIT DESIGN AND THE MATERIALS USED. >> SO IT IS MADE OUT OF NOME EXAMINE. WHICH IS KIND OF STANDARD FOR A LOT OF SPACESUITS BECAUSE IT IS, YOU KNOW, FIRE RESISTANT SO IT WOULD KEEP THE ASTRONAUTS SAFE IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG BUT A LOT OF INNOVATIONS ON WHAT THE SHUTTLES DID, I THINK CHRIS FERGUSON'S FAVORITE IT HAS A HOODED KIND OF FEEL SO IT IS A SOFT SHELL HOOD, NOT HEAVY HELMET ON, OTHERWISE TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVE GLOVES, MORE COMFORTABLE SHOES MADE BY REEBOK AND, YOU KNOW, JUST OVERALL MUCH LIGHTER AND MORE COMFORTABLE SUIT FOR THE ASTRONAUTS AND GOAT SEE THEM DAY GIEW NEXT TIME STARLINER FLIES. SO AS MISSION TEAM PREPARES FOR FINAL COUNT DOWN WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO GET THE BRAND-NEW SPACECRAFT T THIS MOMENT. >> THE WHOLE TOM HAS BEEN THROUGH HIGHS AND LOWS TO GET HERE BUFF THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL TEAM, EMOTIONAL TIME FOR EVERYONE ON THE EM. >> LET'S TALK TO SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO WORKED SO HARD ON THE STARLINER. >> IT IS NOT 100 PERT INVOLVED EVERY SINGLE DAY, WE ARE PUTTING, I AM GETTING EMOTIONAL OVER IT. SOME OF US, IF SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT, THEN, YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT G I THINK TO SLEEP TONIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? >> WE ARE NOT GOING TO SLEEP.  TO IF SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WE ARE NOT GOING SLEEP. WE ARE GOING TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. YOU NOT JUST CARRYING A PARTICULAR AGENCY BUT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. >> BOTH BOEING AND NASA ARE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, NOT JUST FOR THE BENEFITF A PRIVATE COMPANY LIKE BOEING AND NOT JUST FOR AN AGENCY LIKE NASA. THEY ARE DOING THIS ON BEHALF OF THE NATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE -- >> THIS IS HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT. WE HAVE PEOPLE, WE HAVE TEAMMATES AND COLONIES THAT WILL FLY IN THIS VEHICLE. WE NEED MAKE SURE WE GET THEM THERE SAFELY AND WE GET THEM BACK SAFELY. I WOULD FLY EVERY TIME LIKE THIS. THERE IS NO POINT TO ANY OF THIS, TO COMMERCIAL AND HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT IF WE TONIGHT MAKE SURE OUR CREW IS SAFE. >> NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY IN THIS BUSINESS LOSES SIGHT OF WHAT WE ARE DOING. >> THESE SPACECRAFT ARE HAND BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP. WE DON'T EVEN USE POWER ALSO TO ON THEM. >> EVERY LITTLE POSE MEANS SOMETHING IMPORTANT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW AND IT IS JUST LESSONS LEARNED AND KEEPING YOUR EYES AND EARS OPEN. EVERYBODY WATCHES EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU HAVE TO. YOU CAN'T MAKE MISTAKES. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ERROR. >> I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WOULD YOU MAKE THAT DECISION WITH CHRIS'S LIFE IN THE ROOM AND THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS YES. >> YOU HAV TO PUT 100 PERCENT EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW,. AND TAKE TIME FROM OUR FAMILIES TO MAKE SURE THAT HE CAN COME HOME TO HIS. >> OUR GRASS IS TALL AT HOME, OUR KIDS ARE LOOKING FOR US BUT I AM BUILDING A SPACESHIP. >> YOU CAN ONLY DO IT ONE TIME. I KNOW WHAT I HAVE DONE IS A PRETTY GOOD JOB. >> I MIGHT NOT BE RIDING ON IT BUT I AM RIGHT THERE WITH THEM. >> SLAWRCH GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY. THAT IS JUST THE START FOR US. >> WHEN WE SEE IT LAND AND EVERYBODY IS SAFE, THAT IS GOING TO BE REALLY WHEN WE DO THE HIGH FIVE. >> NOW, SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE SITTING IN THE BMCC AND LOOKING AT THEM RIGHT NOW ON THE CONSOLE. THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT TO ENTER THEIR FINAL POLL. >> AND THE BOEING LAUNCH TEAMS HAVE REPORTED OUT FROM THE CONTROL ROOM ON THE HARDWARE READINESS, THAT SIGNAL THAT STARLINER IS READY FOR THAT TERMINAL COUNT. >> TORY HAS BEEN KEEPING TABS ON THEIR PROGRESS. TORY HOW ARE THE FINAL STARLINER POLLS GOING? >> THANKS, JOSH, THE FINAL STARLINER PROCESS GOING EXCELLENT AND ACTUALLY JUST HEARD THE ENGINEERING TEAM GO THROUGH THEIR FINAL PULL SO, POLL THEY SAY THEY ARE GOI BROKEN FOR LAUNCH. EVERYTHING HERE OUT OF THE BMCC IS LOOKING IT FROM AND EVERYBODY IS REALLY NEED AND READY FOR THE TERMINAL COUNT. NOW, WE HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU AT HOME FROM THE WOMAN WHO NAMED ROSIE THE RIVETER. >> HI, EVERYONE, I AM LEANN. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER COMPLEX. >> ASTRONAUTS HALL HALL OF FAME, SURROUNDED BY THE HEROES AND LEGENDS THAT HAVE HAVE INSPIREDE WORK WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY. MY PARENTS ACTUALLY MET WHILE WORKING ON THE SATURN FIVE PROGRAM AND I WAS BORN RIGHT HERE ON FLORIDA'S SPACE COAST. LIKE MANY OF YOU, I AM INSPIRED BY THE WONDER OF SPACE EXPLORATIND IT IS HUMBLING TO BE A PART OF THIS MOMENT HISTORY. WE ARE SO PROUD THAT STARLINER IS A VERY FIRST HUMAN SPACECRAFT TO BE BUILT AND LAUNCHED RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA. THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE TEAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AS FAR AWAY ASTRALIA WHO DESIGNED, BUILT AND TESTED STARLINER. AND THANK YOU TO NASA, WE HAVE BEEN A PROUD NASA PARTNER SINCE EARLIEST DAYS HE OF SPACE FRORGS AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT WE ACCOMPLISH NOTHING THE YEARS AHEAD. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT SPACE IS NOT THE FINAL FRONTIER, IT IS JUST THE NEXT ONE. THINGS STARLINER GETTING THERE WILL BE SAFE, EFFICIENT, AND OBTAINABLE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING OUR SHOW. AND ENJOY THE LAUNCH. >> NOW, H SCENE PROBABLY ONE OF THE PEOPLE MOST EXCITE THABTD, WHENEVER YOU TALK TO SPACE HER EYES JUST LIGHT UP SO WE ARE ALL HOPING FOR A GREAT LAUNCH. WE ACTUALLY JUST GOT CONFIRMATION THAT THEY ARE CONFIGURING STARLINER FOR THE TERMINAL COUNT AND ALL GO RIGHT NOW. IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US WE ARE MINUTES AWAY FROM STARLINER'S FIR LAUNCH ATTEMPT. >> AND ULA WILL BE GETTING READY SOON TO BEGIN ITS POLL TO ENTER THE TERMINAL COUNT, RIGHT NOW WE ARE ABOUT 16 MINUTES FROM LIFTOFF. >> THIS IS A CRITICAL POINT. >> THE COUNTDOWN AFTER THE LAUNCH CLOCK RESTARTS AT T MINUS FOUR MINUTES. IT IS, IF ANOTHER HOLD I CALLED WE WILL SCRUB FOR THE DAY. >> HOLD, HOLD, HOLD ON COUNT DOWN ONE. >> STATUS CHECK BREED TERMINAL COUNT. >> ATLAS SYSTEMS, PROPULSION, GO. >> HYDRAULICS, GO. >> PNEUMATICS, GO. >> LO 2. >> GO. >> WATER, GO. >> CENTAUR SYSTEMS, PROPULSION. >> GO, PNEUMATICS GO. >> LO 2. >> GO. >> LH 2. >> GO. >> BASS. >> GO. >> ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS, AIRBORNE. >> GO. >> ANOMALY CHIEF. >> GO. >> CLEAR TO PROCEED. LAUNCH DIRECTOR. >> LAUNCH DIRECTOR IS GO AND YOU HAVE PERMISSION.  THE COUNTDOWN -- >> 3,2, 1. >> WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES NOW ANSWER MORE OF YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT STARLINER. WE HAVE ONE FROM INGRAM. WANTS TO KNOW YOU HAVE CERTAIN WEIGHT CONCERNS, OBVIOUSLY, SO HOW DO YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WEIGHT OF THE PAINT USED ON STARLINER? >> SO OF COURSE EVERY POUND MATTERS ON A SPACECRAFT. THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T USE TOO MUCH PAINT WE DON'T NEED, AS YOU TELL ON THE VEHICLE THERE ARE SOMETYLE PAINTINGS ON THERE. THE NASA LOGO, THE BOEING LOGO, THOSE KIND OF COOL DASH MARKS AROUND THE TOP, THAT'S THE ONLY PAINT STARLINER DOESN'T NEED, THE GRAY PAINT COVERING, IT IS ACTUALLY THERE FOR THERMAL PROPERTIES, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING STARLINER FOR A WHILE, IT USED  BE, BUT AS WE CONTINUED OUR ANALYSIS WE DECIDED THAT PRAY WOULD BE A LITTLE BETTER AND SAFER ON REENTRY SO WE COVERED IT ONE THIS SPECIAL GRAY PAINT THAT IS VERY HEAT RESISTANT. I MEAN YOU SEE IT IS REALLY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN IS NOT UP BUT YOU TELL THAT KIND OF COLOR ON THE CAP SOUL AT TOP OF THE ROCKET ON THE PAD THERE. >> YES. EXACTLY. IT IS ACTUALLY MAKING USE OF THERMAL BLANKETS. THE GRAY PARTS IS THERMAL BLANKETS AND THERMAL TILES ALSO FROM THE SPACE SHUTTLE BUT A NEW HEAT SHIELD ON THE BOTTOM. WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE UNDER QUESTION AND ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION ABOUT THE G FORCES. MOON MAN WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE MAX LOADS EXPECTED DURING ASCENT. AND THEN WILL THE BOOSTER THROTTLE DOWN MAINTAIN THOSE LOWER GS. QUESTION.S ACTUALLY A GREAT ULA IS FLYING A VERY UNIQUE AJECTORY FOR US A AND GOING TO FLY FLATTER AT MOON MAN SAID AND THE BOOSTER WILL ACTUALLY THROTTLE DOWN DURING THE LATER STAGES OF FLIGHT. TO MAINTAIN THREE AND A HALF G TONS CREW MEMBERS. I WANT TO -- THE ACCESS ARM IS ABOUT TO RETRACT.HT IT WAS RETRG THERE. SO YES, ATLAS WILL FLY A DIFFERENT FLIGHT THAN NORMAL BUT 3 AND A HALF GS IS NOT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE CREW, IT IS SAFE FOR THEM. CHRIS FERGUSON DESCRIBED IT STILL KIND OF FEELS LIKE A GORILLA SITTING ON YOUR CHEST BUTRMAL FOR ABOUT MOST LAUNCHES. >> WE WANT YOU TO KEEP THOSE QUESTIONS COMING. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT QUESTIONS AND REMEMBER TO USE THE HASHTAG ASK NASA AND STANDING BY NOW KEEPING AN EYE ON SPACE LAUNCH COMPLEX 41 WAITING FOR CREW ACCESS ARM TO BEGIN ITS RETRACTION AND WE WILL START TO SEE THE ARM SWING AWAY AND THE WHITE ROOM SLOWLY MOVE AWAY FROM AFT LAS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE LAST VISIBLE THINGS WE WILL SEE AHEAD OF LAUNCH. >> SO UP TO THIS POINT, IF THERE WERE CREW ON BOARD, RIGHT BEFORE THE CREW ACCESS ARM MOVES IS WHERE WE CONFIGURE LAUNCH A SYSTEM. WE WILL SEW IT KIND OF SLOWLY HEF AWAY BUT IT CAN ACTUALLY SWING BACK TO THE CAPSULE IN LESS THAN 22NDS. IF THERE WERE A LIGHTNING STORM COMING IF THE ASTRONAUTS HAS TO GET OFF OFF THE PAD. IF NEED GET OFF THEY WILL LEAVE ON STARLINER. JOSH, YOU MENTIONED THE ABORT SYSTEM I SHEET NOT ACTIVE ON THIS FLIGHT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHY? >> YES. SO ULA HAS THIS NEW EMERGENCY DETECTION SYSTEM ON THE TOP OF THEIR CENTAUR UPPER STAGE, IT IS BASICALLY TWO EXTRA COMPUTERS THAT ARE PLUGGED INTO THE REST OF THE ROCKET AND THEY ARE JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM IS GOING TO WORK. WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE A PREMATURE ABORT SINCE IS THE FIRST TIME THAT SYSTEM IS ON ATLAS BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT SYSTEM IS LOOKING FOR WHAT IS CALLED FAST TRIGGER ABORTS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN SO QUICKLY A HUMAN WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DETECT IT. AND SO WE ARE GOING SEE THAT, OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE ACTIVATED THE NEXT TIME STARLINER FLIGZ, THE NEXT WILL BE CALLED THE YOU FLIGHT TEST AND CARRY BOEING ASTRONAUT CHRIS FERGUSON, NASA ASTRONAUT MIKE FINK AND NICOLE MANN AND THEY WILL BE NEXT TIME SIFTING RIGHT ON TOP OF THAT ATLAS V INSIDE STARLINER. BUT FOR TODAY, OF COURSE, WE HAVE GOT ROSIE INSIDE, SNOOPY INSIDE, AND 600 POUNDS OF NASA CARGO AND WE ARE A LITTLE OVER 11 MINUTES AWAY FROM LAUNCH NOW. AGAIN, JUST STANDING BY BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GT SEE LIVE THAT YOU ACCESS ARM SWINGING AWAY. SO WE WILL JUST KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS FOR YOU. .. ARM CONTROL, CREW ACCESS ARM FOR LAUNCH. >> ROGER. WE JUST HEARD CALL THEY ARE ABOUT TO STOW THE YOU ACCESS ARM AND HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT STARLINER IS RUNNING ON INTERNAL POWER. IT IS NOT RELYING ON GROUND POWER ANYMORE. PULLING POWER FROM ITS OWN BATTERIES. IF YOU JUST JOINING US WE ARE JUST OVER 10 MINUTES FROM LIFTOFF AND WE ARE -- OH THERE IT IS, IT LOOKS LIKE THE CREW ACCESS ARM IS BEGINNING TO MOVE AWAY FROM STARLINER. YOU SEE THE WHITE ROOM EVER SO SLIGHTLY STARTING TO MAKE A SWING. >> AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST MAJOR STEPS, THE NEXT IS THE LAUNCH VEHICLE PULL. THEN WE WILL RELEASE THE FOUR MINUTE HOLD. AND THEN -- >> INTERNAL POWER. >> VERY FOID. >>  NOW IT IS A CREW ACCESS ARM RETRACTS, AGAIN, THE FINAL PULL FOR TODAY IS THE LAUNCH VEHICLE PULL. IF YOU HAVE WATCHED ATLAS LAUNCHES IT WILL SOUND VERY FAMILIAR. THERE IS IS A BIG OLD PISTON PULLING BACK THAT CREW ACCESS ARM. >> AND AFTER ATLAS IS DECLARED READY FOR LAUNCH NASA AND BOEING WILL JOINTLY DECIDE WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE COUNTDOWN. IN ABOUT NINE MINUTES AWAY FROM LAUNCH. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU SEE CREW ACCESS ARM JUST FINISHING ITS SWING AWAY FROM THE ATLAS V ROCKET AND STARLINER AND WE WANT TO GO OVER TO DYLAN NICE THE ASOC FOR ARE A STATUS UPDATE. DYLAN. >> HEY MARKS I ARE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE A CLEAN COUNT DOWN HERE. WE ARE JUST A FEW MOMENTS AWAY FROM CHIEF LAUNCH DETECTOR CONDUCTING THE STATUS CHECK POLL WHICH WILL TAKE US INTO OUR FINAL COUNT DOWN TOAUNCH. T TERMINAL COUNT STATUS CHECK POLL IS THE FINAL CHECK FROM EACH OPERATOR, OPERATOR'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE GROUND SYSTEM, THE LAUNCH VEHICLE, THE SPACECRAFT AND THE EASTERN RANGE TO ENSURE THAT ALL SYSTEMS ARE READY TO GO FOR US TO PROCEED INTO TERMINAL COUNT AND GET THE ROCKET LAUNCHED SO WE ARE JUST ABOUT MINUTE AWAY FROM THAT NOW. I CAN TELL YOU THAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE EXECUTED THIS COUNT DOWN MANY TIMES FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MISSIONS, BUT THE COUNTDOWN TODAY FEELS, FEELS QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE NORMALLY DONE. THE EXCITEMENT HERE IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE AND WE ARE VERY, VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS, SEE MISSION GO AND GO ON TIME. ESPECIALLY WITH SUCH A CLEAN COUNT DOWN LIKE WE HAD TODAY SO REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. THE TEAM HAS NOT BEEN TALKING ABOUT ANY ISSUES AT ALL ON ANY OF THE NETS I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO, SO WHEN THAT TERMINA COUNT STATUS CHECK STARTS WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR GOES ACROSS THE BOARD. >> SO I THINK WE WILL STAND BY HERE AND LISTEN FOR CHIEF LAUNCH CONNECTOR DOUG TO GET THAT POLL STARTED HERE IN ABOUT 20 SECONDS. I THINK. >> STATUS DHOAK PROCEED WITH TERMINAL COUNT. ATLAS SYSTEMS, PROPULSION, GO. >> HYDRAULICS. >> GO. >> PNEUMATIC. >> GO. >> LO 2. >> GO. >> WATER. >> GO. >> CENTAUR SYSTEMS, PROPULSION.  GO. >> PNEUMATICS. >> GO. >> LO 2. >> GO. >> LH 2. >> GO. >> HAZ GAS. >> GO. >> ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS AIRBORNE. >> GO. >> GROUND. >> GO. >> FACILITIES GO. >> FLIGHT CONTROL. >> GO. >>O.CQ. >> OP SUPPORT. >> GO. >> COMM. >> GO. >> UMBILICAL. >> GO. >> ARM CONTROL. >> GO. >> ECF. >> GO. >> RED LINE MONITOR. >> GO. >> QUALITY. >> GO. >> OPS SAFETY MANAGER. >> GO. >> SAFETY OFFICER. >> GO. >> VEHICLE SYSTEM ENGINEER. >> GO. >> ANOMALY CHIEF. >> GO. >> RANGE COORDINATOR. >> CLEAR TO PROCEED. >> FLIGHT DIRECTOR. >> SNRIGHT GO. >> LAUNCH DIRECTOR. >> GO AND LC YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO LAUNCH. PROCEEDING WITH THE COUNT. >> ALC VERIFY FOR 11. 36:43 ZULU. VERIFIED. >> WELL, JOSH AND MARIE YOU HEARD IT, WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH, RIGHTS ON TIME. LL RHANKS, WE HEARD SOME CHEERS BEHIND US OVER AT THE PRESS SITE WHEN WE HEARD YOU HAVE PER NOTIFICATION LAUNCH. I KNOW, YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO LAUNCH. I KNOW THEY ARE FEELING GOD ABOUT THAT. TORY IS STANDING OVER HERE AND SHE HAS A VERY SPECIAL GUEST TO SAY HELLO. >> THANKS, MARIE. YES. I DO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST HERE TODAY. I HAVE CHRIS FERGUSON, FIRST BOEING ASTRONAUT AND FORM -- FORMER SPACE SHUTTLE COMMANDER. SO, CHRIS, YOU HEARD THE POLL, YOU WERE HERE, YOU KNOW, BEING A PART OF SOME OF THE OTHER POLLS THIS MORNINAN YOU TELL U HOW IT ISOING? >> WELL, EVERY LAUNCH HAS ITS EXCITING MOMENTS WE HAD A FEW EARLIER WITH A MINOR ISSUE THAT CAME UP BUT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ALL OF THE NECESSARY RATIONALE TO GO FLIGHT FLYING AND YOU JUST LISTENED TO THE POLL. BASICALLY, EVERYBODY IS IN LYNN AND IN AGREEMENT THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD CONFIGION TO GO FLY. SO IT WAS A LITTLE CLOSE BUT HEY WE ARE GOING TO BE OFF TO THE RACES HERE IN A FEW SHORT MINUTES. >> NOW THIS IS REALLY EXCITING TIME, RIGHTS, LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES HERE UNTIL LAUNCH SO, YOU KNOW, IT IS FUNNY WHEN WE SAY LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES TO LAUNCH BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE BE ON THE PROGRAM FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS NOW. >> UH-HUH. >> SO ALL OF THIS I KNOW HAS BEEN LEADING UP TO THIS MOMENT AND THE CST CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR ROLE WITHIN THE STARLINER PROGRAM. >> I JOINED THE PROGRAM AS YOU HAVE SAID EIGHT YEARS AGO SHORTLY AFTER THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ENDED AND IT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO BE A PART OF THE TE IT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE IN THE DESIGN AND NOW, YOU KNOW, IT IS ALMOST SURREAL. THERE IT IS OUT ON THE PAD, THE LABOR OF THE LAST EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS IS SORT OF COMING TO, YOU KNOW, IT IS GAME DAY, RIGHT  THE BIG TEST IS, ANDIND YOU, YOU KNOW, OUR BIG GAME FOR THE SPACECRAFT ACTUALLY BEGINS WHEN THE LAUNCH VEHICLE RELEASES 11 MINUTES FROM NOW, SO WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO, EVEN THOUGH IS THE EXCITING PART THAT EVERYBODY ENJOYS WATCHING A LAUNCH. OUR BIG TEST REALLY BEGINS WHEN THE LAUNCH VEHICLE SORT OF RELEASES US ANDE HAVE TO GO PERFORM ALL OF THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATS INVESTIGATIONS TO GET READY TO DOCTOR THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TOMORROW. SO WE HAVE GOT A BUSY 24 HOURS. >> YES. THAT IS REALLY EXCITING, RIGHT? IT IS BUSY BUT I KNOW TEAM HERE IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> ALL RIGHT, JOSH AND MARIE, THANKS FOR COMING TO US, BACK TO YOU. GREAT HEARING FROM CHRIS. WE ARE THROW MINUTES AND 20 SECONDS AWAY. THE T MINUS FOUR MINUTE HOLD WAS RELEASED WHILE CHRIS WAS TELLING US ABOUT HOW EXCITE SHED FOR STARLINER. DOWN AND LISTEO THE LOOPS.

STAND BIG FOR IGNITION. .. IN WE HAVE IGNITION AND FULL THRUST ON BOTH RL 10 ENGINES. CHAMBER PRESSURES LOOK GOOD ON BOTH ENGINES. WE HAVE CONFIRMATION OF JETTISON ON STARLINER. >> SWREAND GOOD INDICATION OF ARROW AERO SKIRT JETTISON. CENTAUR NOW RESUMING ATTITUDE CONTROL AFTER SUCCESSFUL JET SON. CHAMBER PRESSURE ON BOTH RL 10 ENGINES CONTINUE TO LOCKOOD. >> TWAS A VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF THE MISSION HERE, STAGING IS ALWAYS A VERY DYNAMIC FEELS OF FLIGHT. >> NOW PASSING FIVE MINUTES, 30 SECONDS INTO FLIGHT. >> AND THE CENTAUR SMS BEGINNING INITIAL THRUSTER FIRING FOR THERMAL CONDITIONING. SYSTEM RESPONSE LOOKS GOOD. ONCE AGAIN CENTAUR WILL CONTINUE BURNING FOR ABOUT ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. NOW PASSING SIX MINUTES INTO FLIGHT. AND CENTAUR IS NOW 95 MILES ALTITU TRAVELING AT 12,000 MILES PER HOUR. >> THE DUAL RL 10 ENGINES, TO PROPEL STARLINER, THEY ARE MAKING UPOR A LITTLE BIT OF THE BOOSTER ARE FLYING A FLATTER TRAJECTORY AND AT LOWER THRUST AGAIN TO MAINTAIN THE THREE AND A HALF G FORCES. AGAIN, A FIRST FLIGHT FOR THE DUAL ENGINE CENTAUR ON AN ATLAS V. TO HEAD TO ORBIT.TAUR CONTINUE >> CENTAUR BURN. CHAMBER PRESSURES HAVE REMAINED VERY STABLE. JUST UNDER FIVE MINUTES NOW REMAINING IN THE BURN. AND KREN STORY NOW 102 MILES ALTITUDE, 800 MILES DOWNRANGE DISTANCE, TRAVELING AT 12,700 MILES PER HOUR. KOOPTING WITH ACTIVE CONTROL, LOOKS GOOD. BODY RATE RESPONSES ARE ALL VERY CLOSE TO NULL. >> THAT MEANS ATLAS IS FLYING ALMOST EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE NOW PASSING EIGHT INTHIEWNTS FLIGHT. >> IF YOU JUST JOINING US, EIGHT MINUTES INTO STARLINER'S FIRST FLIGHT. THERE HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL BOOSTE SEPARATION, CENTAUR CONTINUES TO PROPEL STARLINER. THE NEXT MAJOR MILESTONE WILL BE MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF AT 11 MINUTES 58 SECONDS. >> BOTH CENTAUR RL 10 ENGINES ARE CONTINUING TO PERFORM WELL THROUGHOUT THE BURN, CHAMBER PRESSURES LOOK GOOD. >> AND NOW COMING UP ON NINE MINUTES INTO FLIGHT, KREN STOR 101 MILES ALTITUDE,1,200 MILES DOWNRANGE DISTANCE,. >> NOW TWO CONTROL ROOMS YOU ARE LOOKING AT ON THE LEFT, THAT IS THE ULA DENVER OPERATIONS CONTROL CENTER. THEY ARE A BACK CONTROL ROOM FOR THE CONTROL ROOM ON THE RIGHT WHICH IS THE ACTUAL ATLAS SPACEFLIGHT OPERATIONS CENTER. THEY WERE THE ONES WHO LAUNCHED THE ROCKET.  ABOUT NINE AND A HALF MINUTES AGO. >> AS YOU SEE EVERYONE IS LOCKED IN ON THEIR SCREENS, MONITORING DATA. YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THERE WASN'T MUCH EXCITEMENT DURING LAUNCH, BUT ULA WILL BE HAPPY ONCE WE GET TO STAGE SEPARATION, WHICH IS COMING UP ALMOST 15 MINUTES AFTER LAUNCH, SO ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW. CENTAUR PERFORMANCE CONTINUES. MAIN VEHICLE BATTERY TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES. AND CONTINUE TO SEE GOOD PRESSURES ON OUR HELIUM AND HYDROGEN STORAGE BOTTLES. >> TELEMETRY QUALITY IS GOOD ON THE BURN, SEWING ONLY VERY BRIEF MINOR DROPOUTS. NOW APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE REMAINING IN THE BURN. >> >> SO AFTER STARLINER SEPARATES FROM CENTAUR COMING UP IN ABOUT FOUR MINUTES, STARLINER WILL KRIRK LIES ITS ORBIT WITH AN INSERTION BURN, AGAIN ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF. CHAMBER PRESSURE ON BOTH RL TENS CONTINUE TO LOOK GOOD. NOWAD OF MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF WE ARE SEEING GOOD TANK PRESSURE ON STARLINER ITSELF, BATTERIES ARE AT NOMINAL PRESSURE, GOOD PRESSURE SENSOR READINGS FROM STARLINER, AS IT PREPARES TO FREE FLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ORBIT. STANDING BY FOR MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF. >> AND WE HAVE MICO. >> MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF. >> BODY RATE RESPONSES REMAIN VERY STABLE. >> NOW PASSING 12 MINUTES INTO >> NOW STARLINER WILL STAY AFFIDAVIT TO CENTAUR AGAIN UNTIL ABOUT 15 MINUTES, EXPECTED TO SEPARATE AT 14 MINUTES AND 58 SECONDS AFTER LIFTOFF. >> AND THAT WILL BE THE FIRST STARLINER FREE FLIES IN ORBIT AND AT THAT POINT, RICHARD JONES AND HIS TEAM IN HOUSTON WILL HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THE VEHICLE. AND THEY WILL SET IT UP FOR AN ORBITAL INSERTION BURN THAT WILL TAKE PLACE 16 MINUTES -- 15 MINUTES AFTER SEPARATION. >> APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES NOW REMAINING UNTIL OFT CAPSULE SEPARATION. >> BODY RATE RESPONSES CONTINUE TO LOOK VERY STABLE THROUGHOUT THIS COAST. >>  >> SOU ARE LOOKING AT T BOEING MISSION CONTROL CENTER THERE, AT THIS POINT THEY HAVE TRANSITIONED TO A MISSION SUPPORT ROOM, THE PEOPLE YOU SEEING SITTING ON CONSOLE DESIGNED TESTED AND BUILT STARLINER AND THEY ARE THE EXPERTS ON THE SYSTEMS, SO IF FLIGHT CONTROLLERS NEED ANY HELP, TH WILL BE THE ONES ANSWERING THE CALL. >> NOW PASSING 13 MINUTES, 30 SECONDS INTO FLIGHT. >> JUST OVER A MINUTE WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR THAT STARLINER HAS SEPARATED FROM THE VEHICLE. ABOUT ONE MINUTE NOW REMAINING UNTIL OFT SEPARATING. >> BODY RATES AND ROLL PITCH AND YAW DIRECTION ALL VERY CLOSE TO NULL.   AND ABOUT 30 SECONDS AWAY FROM SPACECRAFT SET. >> NOW STANDING BY FOR SPACECRAFT SEPARATION. >> AND WE HAVE GOOD INDICATION OF SEPARATION OF THE OFT CAPSULE. [ APPLAUSE ] >> THERE IT IS. ULA HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THEIR PIECE OF THE MISSION. STARLINER IS FREE FLYING FOR TH. FROM HERE, THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER MISSION CONTROLLERS WILL BE FLYING STARLINER. WE WILL HEAR REPORTS EX-CLIEWFERL FROM THERE. EXCLUSIVELY FROM THERE. >> AND STARLINER'S SOFTWARE HAS BEEN SWITCHED TO ORBIT MODE MEANING THE SPACECRAFT IS EX-DO YOU AGREE COMMANDS IT NEEDS FOR OPERATING IN SPACE FOLLOWING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH INTO ORBIT, INTO THE ORBITAL TRAJECTORY. THERE IS JUST ONE STEP FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE TAKING IN CONFIGURING STARLINER, NOW THAT IT IS FLYING ON ITS. FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE SETTING UP FOR ORBITAL INSERTION BURN WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE ABOUT 15 MINUTES, A LITTLE OVER 15 MINUTES. AND THAT WILL CIRCUMSTANCE LIES THE ORBIT AS IT .. SETS OFF TO CHASE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THE TEAM HERE IS ALSO TURNING OFF SEVERALTEMS THAT WERE ARE NOT NECESSARY NOW THATBUT STARLINER IS IN ORBIT, WHILE SOME ARE TURNED OFF SOME WILL BE TURNED ON, SUCH AS THE THRUSTER HOUSING USED TO MANEUVER THE STARLINER IN SPACE AND THE SOLAR ARRAYS. THE THRUSTERS WILL STEER STARLINER THROUGH ORBIT AND THE SOLAR ARRAYS WILL OF COURSE CONVERT THE SUN'S ENERGY INTO ELECTRIC ENERGY TO CHARGE THE SPACECRAFT BATTERIES. >> THE KREN STORY INTENTIONALLY LEFT STARLINER IN AN ELLCAL TRAJECTORY THAT WILL MAKE IT EASY FOR THE SPACECRAFT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FUTURE CREWS TO COME BACK TO EARTH AT THIS POINT IF THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT MEANS IT IS ALL ON STARLINER TO MAKE IT THE REST OF THE WAY INTO STABLE ORBIT AND ON TRACK FOR SPACE STATION DOCKING THIS IS WHERE STARLINER'S ORBITAL MANEUVERING ANUDE CONTROL ENGINES COME INTO PLAY, THE 20 HAVE ENGINES CAN EACH PROVIDE UP TO 1400 POUNDS OF THRUST WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO HEAVE THE STARLINER THAT LAST LITTLE BIT INTO ORBIT. THIS HE WILL FIRE FOR ABOUT 40 SECONDS SETTING STARLINER ON THE RIGHT PATH NOT ONLY FOR DOCKING WITHHE SPACE STATION BUT A SERIES OF DEMONSTRATIONS STARLINER WILL PERFORM BEFORE DOCKING. >> AND THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS WILL PROVE THAT STARLINER IS READY TO SAFELY DOCK WITH THE SPACE STATION. THEY ACTUALLY BEGAN ON THE LAUNCHPAD WHEN WE PERFORMED A CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT STARLINER'S GPS AND INFORM GAITION SYSTEMS AGREED IT WAS INDEED ON THE LAUNCHPAD, AFTER THE UPCOMING ORBITAL INSERTION BURNS, DEMONSTRATIONS WILL CONTINUE SO THAT FROWNED CONTROLLERS CAN ENSURE THE SPACECRAFT SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY. WHEN THESE FIRST DEMOS ARE ITS PAST PATH TO THEILL RESUME INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND THE SYSTEMS HERE ARE TELLING US THAT THESE EARLY STEPS ARE COMPLETE AND STARLINER SYSTEMS ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. >> WE STILL HAVE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THAT ORBITAL INSERTION BURN, ABOUT 13 MINUTES UNTIL IT TAKES PLACE. SO LET'S GO BACK TO FLORIDA WHERE JOSH AND MARIE HAVE WATCHED A SPECTACULAR MORNING LIFTOFF. >> BRANDY, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL LAUNCH FROM HERE IN FLORIDA, IT TOOK OFF RIGHT HERE BEHIND US, IT IS, YOU KNOW -- TUN IS TING TO RISE, THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A ROCKET PLUME LEFT OVER THERE BEHIND US. >> THE ROCKET LEFT BACK THERE, BUT I MEAN IT WAS STUNNING TO SEE, I MEAN, I KNOW YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FROM THIS VIEW BUT LOOKING MUCH CLOSER BUT WE JUST TURNED AROUND IN OUR SEATS TO WATCH IT HERE AND COULD FEEL THE RUMBLE AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T SEE PEOPLE SELL BRAIFTING IN THE CONTROL ROOMS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEIR JOB IS NOT DONE AT LIFTOFF, IT GOES BEYOND THAT, MUCH FURTHER, AND SO PEOPLE ARE, I THINK, NOW JUST BEGINNING TO BREATHE AGAIN, AND SO FOLKS ARE JUST SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE MISSION, BUT SUCH A HUGE MOMENTOUS OCCASION THIS MORNING. >> AND WE ARE ACTUALLY HEARING THAT IN THE DMCC, TORY PEDRATI IS WITH LEWIS ATCHISON, STARLINER'S VERY FIRST LAUNCH CONDUCTOR AND SAW US THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL FIRST LAW, TORY AND LEWIS YOU HAVE TO BE FEELING PRETTY BED RIGHT NOW. >> YES, THANK YOU, JOSH, THAT IS -- IT IS REALLY EXCELLENT TO HAVE LEWIS HERE AND TO HAV YOU KNOW, TAKE HIM AWAY FROM THE CONSOLE FOR JUST A MINUTE TO TALK WITH US. SO LEWIS I KNOW THAT YOU AND CHRIS FERGUSON HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE THROUGH ENTIRE PROCESS. I MEAN ASKED TO CREATE THE LAUNCH PROCEDURES, CAN YOU GIVE US SOME DETAILS ABOUT THAT? >> SURE. I THINK AS YOU ALL KNOW, CHRIS HAS A VERY VESTED IN INTEREST IN HOW LAUNCH PROCEDURES WITH PUT TOGETHER. I STARTED WITH THE PROGRAM PROBABLY ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO ABOUT A YEAR IN I WAS STILL A FLIGHT TEST ENGINEER ON THE PROGRAM. I HAPPENED TO RUN INTO CHRIS ON THE VARIABLE ON THE WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING AND QUITE FRANKLY I DIDN'T KNOW HE KNE MY NAM HE SAID, HEY, LEWIS IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SPARE TIME CAN YOU WORK AND MAYBE SEE IF YOU FIGURE OUT HOW THESE LAUNCH PROCEDURES WILL WORK FOR THE PROGRAM AND LIKE OH, SURE, SPARE TIME, I CAN FOINLD TIME TO GET UP ON LAUNCH PROCES. SO THAT BEGANASICALLY A SIX-YEAR JOURNEY ON FINDING A UNIQUE WAY TO INTEGRATE THE UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE, ATLAS V LAUNCH PROCEDURE WHICH IS A TRIED AND TESTED LAUNCH PROCESS. WITH SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER FLOWN BEFORE, OUR SPACE CAPSULE AND WE ARE A LOT DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER PAYLOADS THEY HAVE FLOWN SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WE HAVE TO MERGE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CULTURES, OUR FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM WHICH IS REALLY HOMEGROWN FROM NASA. OUR GROUND CONTROL TEAM WHICH IS HERE AT C 3 F THAT PERFORMS A LITTLE OF THE SPACECRAFT POWER UP ACTIVITIES. >> YES, I AM A FLORIDA LOCAL. >> SO WORKING THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES, PROCEDURES, AND FINDING A WAY TO INTEGRATE ALL OF THAT AND OH BY THE WAY WE HAVE TO FIND TIME TO LOAD A CREW ONE DAY. AND SO TAKING THAT AND MARRYING THOSE TNGS UPO EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER FOR AN INSTANTANEOUS LAUNCH WINDOW SO TODAY FORTUNATELY WE MADE OUR WINDOW, YOU KNOW, IT IS A FIRST FLIGHT PROGRAM, WE SAW CHALLENGES OVER THE EVENING BUT WE HAVE A WORLD CLASS TEAM HERE AND ABLE TO PULL THROUGH LITTLE THINGS WE WERE SEEING, FORTUNATELY WE HAD A GOOD TRAINING PROGRAM ALONGE WAY AND IT IS JUST AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING DAY. >> I NO. AND SEEING SO FAR A SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT HAS JUST BEEN ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES I HAVE HAD WORKING ON THIS PROGRAM PROGRAM. SO YOU MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF SETBACKS, SOME ISSUES THAT WE NEEDED TO WORK THROUGH SO I AM GUESSING TODAY DIDN'T GO EXACTLY ACCORDING TO PLAN? >> NO FIRST FLIGHT DOES. >> WE WERE WORKING A COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH THE SUBCOMM SYSTEM,. >> THE HATCH WE WERE ABLE TO -- WHICH WE LEARNED ABOUT WHEN WE DID OUR INTEGRATED DAY LAUNCH TEST WHICH WAS ACTUALLY A FANTASTIC TEST. WE DID A COUPLE OF PRESSURE MODIFICATIONS. WE HAD TO BLEED A LITTLE PRESSURE OFF TO GET THE HATCH OPEN.YOU WOULD BE RISED HOW A LITTLE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE MIX A BIG DIFFERENCE, THE HEAD TEAM HERE AND RECOVERY TEAM THE DESERT WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THAT SIDE HATCH PRETTY SEAMLESSLY. EXCELLENT AND THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A FLIGHT TEST TO LEARN SO THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE TEST. >> I COMPLETELY GROW. AND THIS BEING THE FIRST LAUNCH THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN A CONTROL CENTER RIGHT NEXT TO THE LAUNCH VEHICLE, WE HAVE ZIPPED ZIPPED, SIMMED .. FLOOR SHAKING AFTER THE ROCKET TOOK OFF TODAY SO IT WAS AN AMAZING ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE THIS MORNING. >> I COMPLETELY AGREE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE TEAM, YOU KNOW, HERE IN FLORIDA BACK IN HOUSTON? ANYBODY WATCHING? >> SURE. SO FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO THANK MY FAMILY FOR ALL OF THE TIME, PATIENCE AND EFFORT THAT THAT WT IN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE WORK LOT OF LONG HOURS TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF THINGS HAPPEN AND I REALIZED THEY ARE AT HOME WATCHING EAGERLY, EXCITED ABOUT THE NEXT PART OF THE MISSION WHICH WILL BE THE RECOVERY OPERATION THAT IA PART OF D ALSO THE TEAM, RIGHT? THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TEAM SPORTS YOU EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINE, AND IT TAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO MAKE ALL OF THIS HAPPEN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE NEED TO BE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND KNOW THE RIGHT STUFF TO MAKE THIS INSTANTANEOUS CH HAPPEN AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU, LEWIS, IT HAS BEEN GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE .. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING TIME TO TALK TO US. >> THANK YOU. >> JOSH, MARIE, BACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU. >> THANKS A LOT. >> THANKS SO MUCH, TORY. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE GO BACK TO JSC I WANT TO EXTEND A MESSAGE TO EVERYONE WATCHING NOT HERE FROM FLORIDA, IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A ROCKET LAUNCH BEFORE IT IS LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN AND IT QUITE LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER SUN IS RISING UP INTO THE SKY SO THE NEXT TIME DO WE THIS, THERE IS GOING TO BE PEOPLE ON BOARD, AND IF YOU IN THE STATES YOU DRIVE WN HERE TO FLORIND COME WATCH US FLY. >> YES. JUST BE PREPARED FOR A LOT OF TRAFFIC. DON'T EXPECTS TO BE GOING ANYWHERE ANY TIME SOON AFTER LAUNCH BECAUSE WE EXPECT THE PLACE TO BE PRETTY JAMMED UP JUST LIKE IT WAS DURING THE SPACE SHUTTLE DAYS. >> YEAH. I THINK THERE WAS UPWARDS OF A MILLION PEOPL HERE. NOW, THIS IS ACTUALLY SOME VIDEO WE GOT OF THE PAD TEAM RIGHT AS THEY WERE CLOSING UP THE LIGHT ROOM SHOWING US THEIR ENTHUSIASM BEFORE THEY GOT OFF THE PAD. JUST TAKING A TEAM MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE HISTORY OF THIS DAY. >> YES. >> I MEAN YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE IT WHEN WE ARE DOING THESE OPERATIONAL THINGS BUT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES I MEAN SWRIEW THEM THAT EMBRACE THERE. IT IS REALLY LIKE A FAMILY. NASA BOEING, ULA WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE TODAY EVERY DAY PEOPLE DOING THIS TOGET.NG HOURS AND EVERYBODY WORKING TOWARD A COMMON GOAL A AND YOU SAW THE CULMINATION OF THAT WHEN WE HAD THE INSTANTANEOUS LIFTOFF ON THE FIRST TRY. >> EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU SAID IT IS VERY MUCH LIKE A PEOPLE, A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE STARLINER IS DOING WELL, ATTACHES TO THE ISS ICE, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IT TAKES SO MUCH WORK AND DEDICATION TO DO WHAT THEY DO. >> AND WE WANT TO GO BACK OVER TO HOUSTON. WE ARE STANDING BY BEFORE TOO LONG STARLINER IS GOING TO BE IN ORBIT SO WE WANT TO GET AN UPDATE FROM STEVE AND BRANDY TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING OVER THERE. HI, GUYS. >> THANK YOU, FOLKS. IT IS VERY -- LOOKING VERY GOOD HERE IN HOUSTON. WE ARE ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF MINUTES AWAY FROM THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN THAT IS GOING TO LE-LIZE. >> IS FLYING OVER SOUTH EAST EUROPE AS IT BEGINS ITS CHASE ABOUT 25 MINUTES AGO .. DONE A CHASE OF THIS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> THAT'S RIGHT, THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WAS ABOUT 260 MILES OVER GREAT AUSTRALIAN BITE SOUTH OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA WHEN STARLINER LAUNCHED TODAY AND THE CREW MEMBERS ON BOARD WERE SENT UP SOME VIDEO OF THE LAUNCH SO I KNOW THEY WERE PROBABLY FOLLOWING ALONG AND CHEERING WITH EVERYBODY ON THE GROUND AS WELL. THEY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING STARLINER DOCKED TO THE SPACE STATION TOMORROW. MORE THAN 24 HOURS OR THELIT STARLINER TO REACH INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ON THIS OR ORBITAL FLIEFGHT TEST. THE REGULAR DOCKING SCENARIO WON'T TAKE THAT LONG WHEN THERE IS A CREW ON BOARD BUT SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STARLINER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALF THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING, THAT EVERYTHING IS DOING WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO, AFTER ALL STARLINER IS ANYTHING ITSELF TO THIS, SO EVEN THOUGH IT IS GOING MACH RIGHT NOW,17,000 MILES PER HOUR TO CATCH UP TO THE SPACE STATION, IT IS STILL GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING THE WAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO AND MAKE SURE STARLINER KNOWS WHERE IT IS, AND WHERE IT IS GOING AND WILL REACH IT IN TIME. >> THAT'S RIGHT. AND ABOUT FOUR MINUTES AWAY FROM THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN, THE TEAM HERE ON THE GROUND IS FOLLOWING ALONG MAKE INSURING ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE HOO HOOKING UP AND TALKINGE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO AS WE GET CLOSER TO THAT, THAT WILL BE ABOUT A 42ND BURN, AND AGAIN MOVING THE STARLINER INTO THE RIGHT ORBIT TO CATCH UP WITH THE SPACE STATION. >> AND IT IS GOING TO BE THE 4 MACH ENGINES ON STARLINER. THEY ARE ORBIT MANEUND CONTROL ENGINES,1,500 POUNDS OF THRUST EACH, SO COMBINED 6,000 POUND KICK TO PUSH STARLINER A LITTLE BIT HIGHER, A LITTLE BIT FASTER, RAISE THE ORBIT AND GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER OF COURSE THOSE ENGINES WILL PLAY BIG ROLE THROUGHOUT THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE STARLINER MAKES ITS RUN AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> WE ARE NOW ABOUT THREE MINUTES AND 14 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN. THIS OF COURSE FOLLOWS A TERRIFICNCH THIS MORNING AND THE POWER OF THE ATLAS V, PUTTING STARLINER ON THE EXACT RIGHT COURSE AND SPEEDING IT FROM ZERO TO ORBITAL VELOCITY, IN JUST ABOUT 11 AND A HALF MINUTES, I THINK OF POWERED FLIGHT. AMAZING HOW LITTLE TIME IT TAKES TO GET TO SPACE. >> SO CONTROLLERS HERE ARE LOG CAREFULLY AT ALL OF THEIR, LOOKING CAREFULLY AT ALL OF THEIR SYSTEMS, IS IT IS VERY QUIET IN THE CONTROL ROM WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN, THAT MEANS THE CONTROLLERS ARE H DOWN, WATCHING OVER THE SYSTEMS, AND KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYTHING SHAFT GOING ON, JUST ABOVE THE MIDEAST NOW. EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON . WE ARE ALSO SEEING HERE THAT STARLINER'S REACTION CONTROL ENGINES, THERE ARE FINE ADJUSTMENTS 100-POUND CLASS ENGINES ARE MAKING SMALL ADJUSTMENTS AS STARLINER ADJUSTS ITSITUDE MOVING ABOVE EARTH. LESS THAN TWO HUNTS TO GO UNTIL THAT BURN. AND YOU SEE HERE THE CONTROL ROOM HERE IN HOUSTON STARLINER MISSION CONTROL, THIS IS OF COURSE A FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM THAT HAS BEEN USED BEFORE FOR NASA MISSION BUTS IS THE INAUGURAL STARLINER MISSION SO IT IS THE FIRST THAT IT  BEEN US FOR THIS BOEING SPACECRAFT. AND OF COURSE CONTROLLERS ARE USED TO THIS ROOM AND HAVE SPENT A NUMBER OF -- A NUMBER OF HOURS IN HERE DOING SIMULATIONS AND EVERYTHING. IT IS A VERY PROFESSIONAL CREW AND MANY OF THESE FOLKS ARE VETERANS OF THE SHUTTLE MISSIONS, CERTAINLY RICHARD JONES, FLIGHT DIRECTOR WHO IS OVERSEEING THIS ASCENT AND ENTRY TEAM. AND WE ARE LESS THAN A MINUTE AWAY FROM THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN. FLIGHT CONTROLLER IS HERE. WE ARE NOT HAVING ANY TECHNICAL ISSUES. THE ENGINES ARETING IN POSITION TO MAKE THAT 42ND FIRING THAT WILL KRIRK-LIZE STARLINER'S ORBIT AND CONTINUE ITS CLAYS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WHICH IS ITSELF CURRENTLY COMING UP ON CENTRAL AMERICA. AND CONTROLLERS ARE MANEUVERING STARLINER INTO THE RIGHT ATTITUDE FOR THIS ORBITAL INSERTION BURN. CONTROLLERS WATCHING THE SYSTEMS SYSTEMS. AND THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN HAS BEEN DELAYED. CONTROLLERS ARE WING THE ATTITUDE OF STARLINER AS IT POSITIONS ITSELF. AND LOOKING AT THE SPACECRAFT IN FLIGHT. >> ONCE AGAIN THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF MINUTES AGO HAS BEEN DELAYED AS THE TEAM HERE ON THE GROUND IS SEEING STARLINER NOT IN CORT ATTITUDE FOR IT. THEY ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT AND WILL BE LOOKING FOR THE NEXT CHANCE TO GET THAT DONE. CURRENTLY STARLINER IS USING ITS 100-POUND CLASS THRUSTERS TO MANEUVER IN SPACE. WE ARE 37 MINUTES INTO THIS FIRST FLIGHT OF STARLINER. AND FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE SEEING WHAT THE ENGINES OF COURSE 1,500 POUND CLASS THRUST EACH ONE OF THEM, THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM ON STARLINER. THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL USE TO COMPLETE THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN. TEAM NEAR STARLINER MISSION CONTROL STILL WORKING THROUGH SOME STEPS TO TRY AND GET STARLINER IN THE RIGHT ATTITUDE FOR THE ORBITAL INSERTION BURN. WORKING ON THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT AND LOOKING TO GET STARLINER IN A GOOD POSITION FOR THAT. AND FLIGHT DIRECTOR RICHARD JONES REPORTS THAT WE ARE A STABLE ORBIT, STARLINER IS IN A STABLE ORBIT. AGAIN STARLINER IS NOW IN A STABLE ORBIT. THEY HAVE GOT IT IN A STABLE POSITION, BUT THE TEAMS HERE ON THE GROUND ARE WORKING THROUGH WHAT THE BEST NEXT STEPS FOR STARLINER SHOULD BE. AND RICHARD JONES REPORTS THAT HIS FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE TURNING THE STARLINER SPACECRAFT TO THE, WHAT WE CALL THE TAIL SUN POSITION. THAT MEANS SOLAR ARRAYS WILL BE POINTING TO THE SUN TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES ON STARLINER. AND OF COURSE TO FOUR SYSTEMS ON THE SPACECRAFT. STARLINER IS IN A STABLE ORBIT. TO POWER THE SYSTEMS ON THE SPACECRAFT. >> AND FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE WORKING THROUGH ALL THE OPTIONS AT DISPOSAL AS THIS MANEUVER TO PUT STARLINER IN A TAIL SUN POSITION TAKES PLACE. STARLINER'S FLIGHTPATH AND ORBIT ARE BOTH STABLE. AND WE DO HAVE AN OFF NOMINAL INSERTION REPORTED. WE HAVE SPACECRAFT CONTROL. GUIDANCE AND CONTROL TEAMS ARE ASSESSING THEIR NEXT MANEUVERS. SPACECRAFT BATTERIES ARE GOOD. AND THE SPACECRAFT IS IN A STABLE ORBIT. MISSION CONTROL, WHERE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS ARE WORKING THROUGH WHAT THE NEXT STEPS FOR STARLINER SHOULD BE. YOU SEE FLI DIRECTO RICHARD JONES STANDING UP THERE BEHIND FLIGHT DIRECTOR CONSOLE TALKING WITH HIS TEAM MEMBERS HERE IN THE ROOM. >>  >> AND ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE HAD ANFF NOMINAL INSERTION. WE HAVE SPACECRAFT CONTROL, GUIDANCE AND CONTROL TEAMS HERE AT STARLINER MISSION CONTROL. OUR, THEY ARE ASSESSING OPTIONS, ASSESSING ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS AND CONTEMPLATING THE NEXT MANEUVERS FOR THE SPACECRAFT. STARLINER H GOOD BATTERIES AND IS IN A STABLE ORBIT. >> AND FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM ALSO REPORTING STARLINER DID FINISH MOVING INTO THAT TAIL SUN POSITION THAT WILL ALLOW ITS BATTERIES TO RECHARGE . . . >> And once again, we have had an off nominal insertion. We have spacecraft control, guidance and control teams here at Starliner mission control. Our, they are assessing options, assessing all of their options and contemplating the next maneuvers for the spacecraft. Starliner has good batteries and is in a stable orbit. >> And flight control team also reporting Starliner did finish moving into th tail sun position that will allow its batteries to recharge. . . ♪ ♪ ♪  AND ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU JUST JOINING US, S LIFTED OFF FROM CAPE CANAVERAL," FLORIDA THIS MORNING AT 6:36 A.M. CENTRAL TIME TO BEGIN ITS CHASE OF THE ICE ICE -- INTERNATIONAL SPACE CENTER WE HAVE SINCE EXPERIENCED AN OFF NOMINAL INSERTION AND THE SPACECRAFT HAS ESSENTIALLY -- IS IN A STABLE POSITION. IT IS FULLY POWERED. MISSION CONTROL HERE IN HOUSTON IS ASSESSING ALL OF THE OPTIONS. WE ARE GOING TO STEP AWAY FROM THE BROADCAST AND YOU CAN STAY UPDATED ON EVERYTHING THAT IS TAKING PLACE WITH THE S MISSION ON BOEING.COM. >> WE WILL BE GIVING YOU MORE INFORMATION HERE ON NASA TV IT IS ARNING PROGRESSES.

76,,Departing Space Station Commander Provides Tour of Orbital Laboratory,"In her final days as Commander of the International Space Station, Sunita Williams of NASA recorded an extensive tour of the orbital laboratory and downlinked the video on Nov. 18, just hours before she, cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Aki Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency departed in their Soyuz TMA-05M spacecraft for a landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan. The tour includes scenes of each of the station's modules and research facilities with a running narrative by Williams of the work that has taken place and which is ongoing aboard the orbital outpost.",NASA,doN4t5NKW-k,"[""hello I'm Sonny Williams I'm up here on the International Space Station no want to say where we are so right now we're in the Japanese laboratory it's one laboratory out of many here on the International Space Station it's actually on the left-hand side if I was International Space Station and I was flying through space like this my left hand would be where the Japanese laboratory is so now again we're on the right hand side all the way on the right of the International Space Station this is Columbus the European module it has science experiments all over you could see it looks a little bit crowded and here we do a lot of our medical experiments so this is no - this is a really cool module of course most of these modules you'll see they have four sides and they're put together that way we could sort of wat work on a flat plane either a wall a floor another wall or the ceiling but you know again all you have to do is turn yourself and your reference changes the reason I'm bringing that up is because this is where four out of six of us sleep and so people always ask about sleeping in space do you lie down are you in a bed not really because it doesn't matter you don't really have the sensation of lying down you just sit in your sleeping bag so here's one sleep station right here I'm going in right now you can follow me if you want so I'm inside it's sort of like a little phone booth but it's pretty comfy I've got a sleeping bag right here that we sleep in so we don't have a sort of like a little bit of a cover and we don't fly all over the place but you know you can sleep in any orientation I have it sleeping feeling like I'm standing up right now but like you saw I'm on the floor but it doesn't matter if I turn over and I sleep upside down I can't have it I don't have any sensation in my head that tells me that I'm upside down so it really doesn't matter the sleep station is also like a little office we've got a computer in here as you can see we've got a couple little toys I've got some books I've got some clothes and other things that make it sort of like home I'm coming out and just for reference that's one sleep station this one's another right here there's one on the ceiling if you want to call it right here and then there's a fourth on the other wall over here so all of us sleep in a little bit of a circle all right come on back there's more to show you here we are in the u.s. laboratory again this is a laboratory with science experience on all of the walls here all sorts of stuff that we do and one of the things we also do is we exercise we have some exercise equipment on board the space station we need to do that because we lose bone density and muscle mass while we're up here and that's a result of not having to fight against gravity so how we keep ourselves in shape are with a bike a treadmill and a weightlifting machine this is the bike you notice the clip the pedals so all you need to do is actually clip your feet in and then you can start pedaling you don't need a seat because you don't sit down actually I haven't sat down for six months now so you don't need any any type of seat just make sure you're you're held in with your pedals you probably see that the bike bounces around a little bit as I move it it's not steady and held to the wall firmly and the reason for that is the space station is pretty big you saw that there's also solar arrays on the space station if we start putting any forces into the space station it's going to make those solar arrays bounce around a little bit so to prevent that the machines bounce around a little bit move around a little bit and that way we don't put any forces on to the structure of the spacecraft out to the solar arrays all right a little farther on come on here's a pretty cool place this is sort of like in your house where everybody meets in the morning after you wash your face brush your teeth you want to find something for breakfast and this is our kitchen you might notice there's all sorts of foods here it's like opening the refrigerator you got all your different stuff that you want to have drinks meats eggs vegetables cereals bread snacks and that's a good place that's where you find all the candy side dishes and then some little power bars just in case so we have all this type of food some of it is dehydrated and so we have to hydrate it fill it up with water some of it is already made and then all we have to do is heat it up so something like this I'm pulling out barbecued beef brisket pretty yummy not only is this food made in the US but we also have food here from Japan we've got Russian food as you can see all these red containers are filled with food that's from Russia and now we get some of our specialty stuff some things that we like some of our favorite stuff that your family can send up in fact I like fluffernutter's and so I got sent up some fluff so I could make my fluff another with peanut butter so you have a lot of food up here no problems I'm here with my two buddies in the airlock actually these are two spacesuits that are ready primed up to go outside as we call it to go do a spacewalk in case we have to do any thing outside some of the things we do Outsiders just like inside repairs we have a lot of electrical boxes and machinery and solar arrays in fact that I talked about earlier that are outside and sometimes they don't work quite right remember space is really cold and really hot and it's also the vacuum of space with no pressure and so some of the equipment doesn't work well all the time so we might have to go out and do a spacewalk right behind me is actually the hatch that you go out into space and right now we have it filled up with a couple other spacesuits because we've got four of them up here and some of our tools but right behind here is the hatch in which you actually go right outside into the vacuum of space the spacesuit is pretty big as you can see it's like being a football player part of the reason it's so big and bulky is because of this backside this backpack it's like going on a hike with a backpack but the backpack and the suit weighs about 300 pounds luckily in space nothing really weighs anything so you don't feel that it's so heavy but we need to have such a big suit because that guy back there is essentially the heart of the spacecraft this I call this actually a spacecraft it has all the oxygen for you it has all the carbon dioxide removal system for you it also has a heating and cooling system to make sure the regulate our body temperatures while we're outside it also has a computer so it tells you on a display here if there's anything that is going wrong with the suit if we're running out of oxygen if we have too much carbon dioxide or any type of electrical problem so it's a pretty awesome little spacecraft and actually got to go out use my spacecraft little spacecraft a couple times and it worked like a charm lucky that it works very nice you might want to see what the helmet looks like it's pretty cool too we don't usually go out like this so you usually can see when the helmets open so you can see what it looks like inside somebody's little head would be inside of here so you can see you can turn your head all the way around while you're inside of there but the helmet stays still so it's determined you're you're how far you could see and it's usually pretty sunny out there so we have to wear our sunglasses and this is our sunglasses right here which make you look pretty cool [Music] here we are at the throne this is awesome you might see the little you might have noticed a little moon on the outside this is our orbital outhouse right here and of course it serves for two functions number two right here I'll show you but you see it's pretty small so you have to have pretty good aim and you'd be bit be ready to make sure things get let go the right direction and it smells a little bit so I'm closing it up and that's of course for number two and this guy right here is for number one so there's sort of two slightly separate functions but you can do a little essentially both by hanging on right here and doing number one and number two I might add it's color coded so you really don't get it mixed up which is nice this is yellows for number one and also there's a selection of paper people always ask about toilet paper what do you do a toilet paper what kind of toilet paper do you have we have gloves just because sometimes it does get messy we have some Russian wipes which are a little bit coarse if you like the coarse type of toilet paper we have some nice tissues which are nice and soft if you like soft toilet paper we have Huggies just for any cleanup you know we're all babies once and this sort of helps and then if things get really out of control we have disinfectant wipes just to make sure we clean up here because you know just like the water I showed you the number one stuff can sort of go all over the place if you don't aim correctly and did I mention both of these have a little bit of section so they shouldn't keep things going in the right direction but like I said sometimes things get a little out of control if you are out of control yourself flying around so we have lots of protective stuff and of course you do have your privacy there's a little door so other people know that you're in there now I'm going to take you to one of the coolest places on the Space Station [Laughter] it's like a glass-bottom boat this is the cupola it stick sticks down below the space station it's one of those places you find yourself hanging out and all the time because all you want to do is look back at our planet I think some questions I had were about what are you doing your free time and you can't help but want to just come to the cupola and look outside as much as you can and a lot of folks I play this game with myself about where we're flying over the earth I try to come in here and just guess after being here for a little while you can sort of figure it out you can tell different cloud types over different continents you can tell different soil types over different continents so let's see and then of course there's a lot of ocean so usually we're over the ocean at first glance I will tell you in just a moment where we are what there we go right now we are right over Africa it's a little bit cloudy as you can tell so we're right over the continent of Africa hey what's that they think that's a Soyuz spacecraft that's the spacecraft that's taking us home to planet Earth today oh my gosh we might have to go take a look at that that's pretty cool it's a little bit smaller than the rest of the spacecraft the space station so you'll see if we get go there it'll be a little bit more cramped so we're going you can look all the way back to the back of the spacecraft which is where the Russian segment is and then you could look all the way forward to the front of the spacecraft where the where the Japanese laboratory the European laboratory and the American laboratory hey one thing I didn't show you or I talked about but I didn't show you was the exercise one another piece of exercise device this is what we call the a red and with this you can lift weights based on vacuum in these cylinders just like you do at home at a gym for example if I wanted to do a squat I could do it like this which means some weight on this thing I'm not lifting with anything so it's dirty it's too easy one of the cool things you could do you could do things that you can't do at home for example single leg squats with just one leg because the other leg it won't fall over so all sorts of stuff you can also do bench press we have a bench that we could add on here so you can work on your beach muscles alright I showed you the Sawyer's let's go check it out hey Aki what are you doing down there this is one of the cool things about space too it sort of looks like there's a big old hole here but you don't even think twice about it you can just jump over the hole or if you want you can go jump into the hole I'm coming down back up again like Superman we were lucky we have a really cool big Space Station that you can fly around and that's actually called the PMM you might have saw it out the window is a big silver cannister what's really great about that is it's essentially our closet in our pantry or whatever you want to call it we have extra food down there we have extra clothes we actually throw the trash out down there so it's nice and organized and we have all of our stuff that we need while we're working in all these other modules all stowed in this location down here and it's a lot of fun to play in now that's a lot bigger than the Soyuz Oh one thing we need to show you is our patches here well we've been up here we've been expedition 32 first and then just recently we're leaving will be we were expedition 33 and there's all the crew members who are up here with us right now myself yuri malenchenko aki hoshide if you couldn't read japanese you've guinea tarelkin if you can read Russian Oleg Novitsky and Kevin Ford who just took over as the commander of the space station and will be the commander for the next couple months and he by the way is behind the camera right now so you can say hi Kevin they were going into the Russian segment be ready you don't need a passport either [Music] it goes a lot farther back than this we'll go take a trip and say hello to the boys down there in just a minute but let's do that first actually then we'll go down to the Soyuz at the very end this is your beginning this is the FTB and what's cool about this module it is actually the very first piece of the space station that came up in 1998 the space station has been around for about now man for 12 years but it's been up in space for about 14 years and this was the very first it is like the Russians pmm it has a lot of storage as you can see so here we are in the heart of the space station really this is the service mall module this is the central post in case we had any problems I know when a couple of the questions are what type of things do you have to worry about and some of the things we have to worry about in space are fire if we had a fire if we had a depressurization like we were hit by a micrometeorite and it made a hole or if we had some type of toxic atmosphere we use ammonia for our radiator so there is a possibility that ammonia could come into the vehicle and then it would be bad for all of us if we have any of those problems we come right here which we call the central post it is the main heart of the space station it was also the first computers that came up here that ran the space station so behind this wall right here are these main computers so we gather here as a group of three or six and then figure out how we're gonna either fight the fire patch the hole or solve the the toxic spill and what's cool about this module of course is the central post it also has great windows right down toward Earth it has controls to fly in visiting spacecraft if some assistance right here it has Russian computers as well as American computers to help us control anything we need to on the space station it's a couple of our crewmates back there Oh live Oleg Novitsky on the right and nearing launching Co on the left there's also second bathroom here which is really cool because six of us going to one bathroom is really tough and so there's one bathroom here in one bathroom on the other side where I showed you and you can probably see on the wall behind a leg and earring some of the heroes of the space program Korolev Sergei Korolev who was a chief designer of putting men into space and of course on the right hand side Yuri Gagarin the first man this reminds us of our roots I'm gonna stop here just for a quick second you can see on the Russian spacecraft there's also other modules that stick out down and above right here is let's see them trying to be oriented that's a place where we do spacewalks trim for the Russians the Russian side there's Russian spacesuits in here and also a visiting vehicle which brought fruits and vegetables and becomes a trash container when we undock upon this side is also a future place where they're going to do spacewalks from and connected to it is Kevin's a legs and you're Ginny's Soyuz spacecraft and now we'll still see ours Venezia at the probe gun [Music] [Music] coming down it's a little tricky getting in here this is the docking probe right here this big thing this helps us connect to the spacecraft this probe actually sticks into this cone and that's how the spacecraft this our Soyuz becomes connected to the ISS initially that is then replaced by clamps which are around here that will allow the two spacecraft to be stuck together and then you can remove the probe in the cone all right so here we are business or use this is what we call the Beto the living compartment with the boy up second Russian it also has a little bathroom it's not as good as the other bathrooms so we try not to use it too much it has drinking water in it if we need something to drink and then of course it's filled up with a lot of cargo for us for us bringing up and also bringing back down it has a second purpose when it comes back to earth it serves as a garbage container during the descent will will get rid of this area right here and everything that's in it will just burn up as it's coming into the atmosphere so that way we can get rid of a little bit of trash but the main area where we were on launch and where we're going to be on descent is down here because we're not part of the trash so we're in a safe place so we're in the descent module si it's a little small but you can get in not sure how well you could see in here hold on for a second I'm going to turn it up this way just so you could see the hatch and you can see Kevin it's a little bit small though we'll come in and show you around just starting to get ready we're preparing a couple days ago for a ride home it's a little bit squishy but everybody asks how do you sit in the Soyuz and you sort of sit in your seat like this seat is molded through your body and so you can just sort of squish in here and be pretty relaxed everybody has a handmade seat for them and then of course there's a control panel and that's where we do most of our actions and work right here there's hand controllers which you can fly the vehicle with and there's a stick right here primarily used for communications when we're trying to talk to the ground so three of us fit in here like I said it's a little squishy but somehow it seems like we all managed to get in here and and fit pretty well and it's a pretty safe ride home you're probably wondering what's all this junk behind us well it's all of our parachute first of all and then it's all of our survival gear just in case we end up landing in some strange place on the planet and nobody's there to rescue us right away we have all sorts of survival gear with us keeping us safe in here so they've pretty much thought of everything we'll be home on the planet within the next 12 hours pretty shocking""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,,Expedition 62 Crew Returns to Earth From Space Station,"After months living and working on the International Space Station, NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir and Oleg Skripochka of the Russian space agency Roscosmos are returning to Earth.On board the orbiting laboratory, Andrew Morgan contributed to hundreds of experiments and conducted seven spacewalks. During her first spaceflight, Jessica Meir conducted the first three all-woman spacewalks with crewmate Christina Koch.Join us and follow along as they make their voyage back to the Earth.",NASA,nsBcTR3gZvs,"[""THE THREE CREW MEMBERS. NASA ASTRONAUT MERE AND RUSSIAN  CAUSE NO ASTRONAUT ALEX AND  ANDREW MORGAN. AFTER UNDOCKING AT 8:53 CENTRAL  TIME MODULE ABOARD THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION  THEY'RE APROEUFPING WHERE IT  WILL CONDUCT ITS DEORBIT BURN. TONIGHTLL WE'LL BE LOOKING  FORWARD TO THE LANDING SCHEDULED FOR 12:16 A.M. CENTRAL TIME ON  APRIL 17TH. I'M LEAH OF NASA ASK WE'RE LIVE  AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM AT  NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. LEADS ARE BEING BEING LEAD BY  FLIGHT D MARCUS FLS. TO HIS RIGHT YOU CAN SEE ANDREAS MIKE IS KEEPING TABS OF  EVERYTHING HAPPENING WITH THE  SOYUZ VEHICLE NOW ON ITSAY  HOME. YOU GOT LIVE LOOK. THIS IS A TOWN OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW WHERE THE TEAM WILL BE  CONTROLLING ALL OF TONIGHT'S  LANDING OPERATIONS. BOTH THE HOUSTON AND MOSCOW  FLIGHT CONTROL TEAMS ARE FULLY  FOCUSSED ON LANDING OF THE SOYUZ MS-15 SPACECRAFT ALMOST 19 MILES AWAY FROM THE S STATN. INSIDE ARE NASA'S GENTLEMENS  SAMYR AND ANDREW MORGAN AND OLEG COP COP. THEY'RE ARE LANDING TO DEPART  FROM HELICOPTERS FROM THE AIR  FIELD IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE 26 FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THAT  WILL SERVE AS A COMMAND AND  CONTROL CENTER RELAYING VOICE  AND DATA ONCE IT'S IN RANGE HAS  DEPARTED AND IS EN ROUTE TO THE  LANDING SITE ABOUT 2.5 HOURS  AWAY.  AFTER THE HATCH CLOSES AT 5:44  CENTRAL TIME TONIGHT, THE CREW  PERFORMED LEAGUE CHECKS AND  SYSTEM CHECKS ENSURING THE  SPACECRAFT WAS READY TO GO AND  DONNED THEIR LAUNCH AND ENTRY  SUITS. AT 8:53:30 THE HOOKS ON THE  SOYUZ WEREPENED AND TOOK WITH  IT JESSICA MEIR AND DREW MORGAN  AND COMMANDER OF THE SPACECRAFT  OLEG COPE COPE IN THE CENTER  SEAT. IT PERFORMED A SUCCESSFUL BURN  ONE AND NOW IT'S APPROACHING THE 19 MILE DISTANCE NECESSARY FOR  IT TO EXECUTE THE DEORBIT BURN. THAT WILL SLOW IT DOWN BY 128  METERS PER SECOND ALLOWINGO  DROP OUT OF THE ORBIT AND  REENTER THE ATMOSPHERE. AS THE SOYUZ DID HE PARRED  TONIGHT AT THE MOMENT OF  UNDOCKING EXPEDITION 63 BEGAN  WITH ASTRONAUT CHRIS CASSIDY AS  COMMANDER AND RUSSIAN US A M  ASTRONAUTS THIS.  CREW HAVING  ARRIVED LAST WEEK. THEY'LL BE ABOARD UNTIL LATER  THIS YEAR IN OCTOBER. FOR A LOOK AT HOW TO KNIT'S  EVENTS WILL UNFOLD IT'S LOOK. WE SAW THE UNDOCKING OF THE SPACECRAFTM THE MODULE AT  8:53 P.M. CENTRAL TIME. THE NEXT THING IS THAT DEORBIT  BURN SUCCEED YOU'LLED FOR 11:52  THAT WILL LAST 4 MINUTES AND 41  SECONDS DROPPING THE SOYUZ OUT  OF ORBIT AND INTO THE EARTH'S  ATMOSPHERE. AT 11:50 THE THREE PORTIONS WILL SEPARATE AND THE DECENT MODULE  WILL HAVE ITS HEAT SHIELD FROM  TRAVEL PROTECTING THE CREW THAT  IS REACHING OUTSIDE. JUST ABOUT TWO SECONDS BEFORE  THE CREW TOUCHES DOWN ON TO  KAZAKHSTAN THERE WILL BE A  SOFTENIN FIRING SLOWING IT DOWN  JUST A BIT MORE FOR A SOFTER  LANDING. THE SOYUZ WILL LAND 92 MILES  SOUTHEAST OF THE TOWN OF  GENTLEMEN KA ST A REDUCED NUMBER ARE SUPPORTING  LANDING. SOME WERE IN KAZAKHSTAN TO  SUPPORT IT LAST WEEK AND WERE  JOINED BY A SMALL NASA TEAM THAT FLEW IN ON THE GULF STREAM PLANE IN CENTRAL KAZAKHSTAN. BECAUSE THE AIRPORT WAS CLOSED  BY KAZAKHSTAN AUTHORITIES, THE  RUSSIAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY  FORCEREWORKED LOGISTICS AND  DECIDED TO STAGED LANDING  OPERATIONS WITH HELICOPTERS AT  THE AIRPORT. SINCE THEY WERE ALREADY THERE TO SUPPORT LAUNCH LAST WEEK IN  EVENT OF AN CONTINGENCY. HAVING DEPARTED EARLIER THERE  WILL BE 8 HELICOPTERS DEPLOYED  AND TWO TO THE BALLISTIC LANDING SITE AND 6 ARE IN GENTLEMEN KA  STAN REFUELLING AND THEY'LL  DEPART SOON FOR THE LANDING SITE ABOUT . THE HELICOPTERS ARE ALREADY  HEADING TO THE LANDING SITE. 6 WING AIRCRAFT ARE EMPLOYED. ONE IS IN THE AREA OF THE  BALLISTIC SITE AND THETHER AS  WE MENTIONED IS ALREADY EN ROUTE TO THE LANDING SITE AND SERVE AS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER  BETWEEN THE BACK TO RUSH USUAL  SHA. THAT WILL REPLAY VOICE AND DATA  FROM THE SOYUZ TO THE FLIGHT  CONTROLLERS AT THEIR MISSION  CONTROL CENTER AND ABLE TO PICK  UP THAT DATA FROM SOYUZ ONCE IT  IS IN RANGE. PUSH PUSH AFTER LANDING THE CREW WILL RETURN BY RUSSIAN  HELICOPTERS TO THE RECOVERY TO  THEY'LL BOARD A NASA PLAIN  LOCATED THERE FOR A FLIGHT BACK  TO HOUSTON. WE'RE EXPECTING GOOD WEATHER. 61 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WITH WINDS IN THE SOUTHEAST. A NICE WELCOME HOME FOR THE CREW WHO HAS SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN  SPACE. YESTERDAY JESSICA MEIR SPOKE  ABOUT THE EXTENSIVE MEASURES  NASA HAS DEN. >> THIS SITUATION HAS  DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED OUR PLANS. OUR SUPPORT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  FIGURED OUT TO PICK US UP. WE LAUNCH OFFED IN THE SOYUZ  FROM BIKE INNOR AND WE LAND IN  KAZAKHSTAN AS WELL. EVEN GETTING THAT NASA AIRCRAFT  OVERRE WITH ALL THE  INTERNATIONAL STOPS INVOLVED HAS BEEN QUITE AN EFFORT. WE'RE TAKING A SHREUFT PATH. IT'S A PLANES, TRAINS AND  AUTOMOBILES SCENARIO. WE'RE  -- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME LANDING SO WE'T HAVE  ANYTHING T COMPARE IT TO. ONCE WE GET HOME, NORMALLY WE  HAVE LITTLE BIT OF A QUARANTINE  PERIOD WHICH HAS  BEEN SOFT IN  THE PAST. BECAUSE ONE OF THE HALLMARKS A  DISCIRCULATION OF THE IMMUNE  SYSTEM WE CAN CBACK IMMUNO  COMPROMISE DZ. SO THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE  KEEP US SAFE AND HEALTHY. SO WE'LL HAVE A MORE STRICT  QUARANTINE WHERE WE'RE LIVING AT NASA WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO MAKE SURE WE REMAIN HEALTHY AS WELL. >>  NASA ASTRONAUT ANDREW MORGAN LAUNCHED ON JULY 20, 2015, THE  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE APOLLO  11 LUNAR LANDING. TODAY HE AND JESSICA MEIR AND  OLEG LANDED 50 YEARS TO THE DAY  APOLLO 13. THE CRISIS WAS IN SPACE AS  FLIGHT CONTROLLERS WORKED TO  BRING THE APOLLO 13 CREWS SAFELY HOME. 50 YEARS LATER THINGS ARE A  LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT ON THIS  SIDE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AS WE  NAVIGATE LIFE DURING A PANDEMIC. IN BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE  UNITED WORLDWIDE AS WE WORK TO  MOVE FORWARD TO BETTER DAYS. WE'RE ABOUT 10 MEN'S AWAY FROM  THAT DEORBIT BURN THAT WILL  BRING THE SOYUZ SLOWING IT DOWN  BY 128 METERS PER SECOND. THAT'S ENOUGH TO DROP IT OUT OF  THE EARTH'S ORBIT WHICH IS  EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO BRING IT HOME SAFELY TOAZAKHSTAN. THE SOYUZ WILL BE ABOUT 32  KILOMETERS OR 19 MILLIONS AWAY  FROM THENTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION. ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER THAT. THE MODULE ON TOP OF THE DESCENT MODULE WHERE THE CREW IS SEATED  IT WILL BE DEPRESSURIZED AND  VACUUMED. ONCE THEY SEPARATE THAT ORBITAL  MODULE WILL DEPART AT .28 METERS PER SECOND AND THE PROPULSION  LEAVING THE DECENT MODULE AND  THE CREW INSIDE WITH THEIR HEAT  SHIELD EXPOSED IN THE DIRECTION  OF TRAVEL. THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURES AROUND THE  DECENT MODULE WILL BUILD UP T  200500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND  THE HEAT SHIELD WILL PROTECT THE  ASTRONAUTS INSIDE AND AT THAT  TIME WE WON'T HAVE ANY  COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SOYUZ  CREW BUT THOSE SHOULD BE  RESTORED UPON EXIST ONCE THE  SPACECRAFT IS IN RANGE OF T  AIRCRAFT. YOU'LL HEAR A BEACON SIGNAL JUST BEFORE THE PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT  AND 15 MINUTES PRIOR TO LANDING. THE COMMAND SHOULD COME TWO  MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT. THAT COMMAND IS TRIGGERED BY A  BEAR METTIC PRESSURE SENSOR AT  AN ALTITUDE AT SECOND THE TKROEG CHUTE HAS BEEN RELEASED SLOWING IT DOWN TO 80  METERS A SECOND. THE MAIN PARACHUTE HAS BEEN  RELEASED COVERING AN AREA OF  1,000 METERS. IT ALLOWS THE SOYUZ TO SLOW TO A DESCENT RATE OF 7.2 METERS PER  SECOND. WE'LL BE COMING UP ON THAT  DEORBIT BURN AT 11:22 TOO. AS WE MENTIONED DREW MORGAN IS  WRAPPING UP A 272 DAY MISSION  ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION. HIS FIRST MISSION IN THE FOURTH  LONGEST SPACEFLIGHT BY A U.S.  ASTRONAUT. HESO COMPLETED 7 SPACEWALKS  ON THIS MISSION WITH OVER 45  HOURS AND 48 MINUTES OUTSIDE THE HATCH. NASA ASTRONAUT JESSICA MEIR WAS  ON THE FIRST FLIGHT THIS MISSION RACKING UP 205 DAYS AND THREE  SPACEWALKS WALK ALL COMPLETED  WITH NASA ASTRONAUT CHRISTINA  KOCH FOR THE FIRST FEMALE  SPACEWALK. THE COMMANDER OF THE SPACECRAFT  AND EXPEDITION 62 TOTALLED HIS  CAREER FLIGHT TIME TO 536 DAYS  IN SPACE. ABOUT 86.9 MILLION MILES AROUND  THE EARTH DURING THEIR FLIGHT. HOW MUCH WAS USED. COPY. ABOUT 5 MINUTES AWAY FROM THAT  DEORBIT BURN COMMITTING SOYUZ TO DEORBIT AND ITS JOURNEY HOME. THOSE THRE SPACE ASTRONAUTS ARE COMING TONIGHT. THREE MORE ARE WORKING ON THE  SPACE STATION 6 MONTHS. THIS TRIO ARRIVED 8 DAYS AGO  LASTING UNTIL OCTOBER AND  THEY'LL SEE THE SpaceX DRAGON. THE WORLD MAP AS SPACE STATION  AND SOYUZ CROSS OVER THE SOUTHERN TIP OF CHILE. THE SPACE STATION AT TRAVELING  17,500 MILES PER HOUR. THE SPACE STATION ORBITS THE  EARTH EVERY 90 MINUTES SEEING 16 SUN RISES AND SUNSETS EVERY DAY. JUST TWO MINUTES NOW UNTIL SOYUZ NEXT MAJOR MILESTONE. THE DEORBIT BURN FOR 4 MINUTES  AND 41 SECONDS IN DURATION. WE'RE ONE MINUTE POP AWAY FROM  THAT BREAKING MANEUVER. WE ARE STANDING BY FOR  ACTIVATION IN 30 SECONDS. 30 SECONDS UNTIL THE DEORBIT  BURN. >>  WE COPY. DEORBIT BURN IS IN PROGRESS. THAT RETRO GRADE FALLING. ALLOWING IT TO DROP OUT OF ORBIT AND BACK INTO THE EARTH'S  ATMOSPHERE.   >>  ONE MINUTE INTO THE DEORBIT  BURN. WE USED UP 90. WE COPY. >>  TWO MINUTES INTO THE DEORBIT BURN. 2:40 SECONDS REMAINING. DEORBIT CREW CONTINUES AND THE  CREW IS COMMITTED TO THE  RE-ENTRY OF THE EARTH'S  ATMOSPHERE. THE COMMANDER REPORTING DOWN TO  RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL THE  AMOUNT OF FUEL THAT HAS BEEN  USED SO FAR FOR THE DEORBIT  BURN. EVERYTHING PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY. >>  4 MINUTES. >> 4 MINUTES INTO THE DEORBIT  BURN AND 41 SECONDS LEFT. DEORBIT BURN ALMOST COMPLETE. 11:27 P.M. CENTRAL TIME THAT  DEORBIT BURN IS COMPLETE AND THE CREW IS COMMITTED TO DEORBITING  AND ENTRYING EARTH'S AT HOSPITAL FEAR. 5 MINUTES FROM NOW THE MODULE ON TOP OF THE SOYUZ WILL BE  DEPRESSURIZED PREPARING FOR  SEPARATION OF THE MODULES. WITH THAT 5 MINUTES FROM THE  START OF THE BURN, THE ORBITAL  MODULE HAS BEEN DEPRESSURIZED TO VACUUM. WITH THE DEORBIT BURN COMPLETE  AND THE PRESSURIZATION OF THE  MODULE THE NEXT WILL BE THE  SEPARATION OF THE MODULES. THAT WILL BE AT 11:50 P.M.  CENTRAL TIME. THE ORBITAL MODULE WILL DEPART  PROPULSION WILL DRT LEAVING   BEHIND ONLY THE DESCENT MODULE  IN WHICH THE CREW IS SEATED  INSIDE. ALMOST THREE MINUTES AFTER THE  SEPARATION OF THE MODULE THE  CREW WILL BEGIN TO FEEL THE  FIRST PULL OF GRAVITY DURING THE INTERFACE. THE FIRST TIME THAT MORGAN WILL  HAVE FELT IT FOR 9 MONTHS AND 6  MONTHS FOR JESSICA MEIR AND  RUSSIA'S COSMONAUT OH HREBG  LEG SKEURP SKEURP. JUST ABOUT 20 MINUTES FROM THAT  SEPARATION OF THE SOYUZ  EVERYTHING MOVED AS PLANNED  12:16 A.M. APRIL 17TH, CENTRAL  TIME. THE RETURNING SOYUZ MS-15 CREW  OF NASA ASTRONAUT JESSICA MEIR  PHA IS IN THE LEFT SEAT OF THE  DESCENT MODEL AND SHE'S SERVING  AS BACK-UP OF OLEG SKRIPOCHKA IN THE MIDDLE SEAT AND ON HIS RIGHT 272 DAYS IN SPACE IN THE RIGHT   SEAT AS BOARD ENGINEER 2. MEANWHILE ON THE GROUND, NASA  AND RUSSIAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY  FORCES ARE IN THE AIR ABOARD THE RUSSIAN MI8 HELICOPTERS TO THE  LANDING SITE ABOUT AWAY. IT'S HE ABOUT A 35 MILE FLIGHT  THEY'LL CIRCLE THE LANDING SITE  IN A RACE TRACK FASHION AWAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE VEHICLE. NEXT MILESTONE WILL BE THAT  MODULE SEPARATION. AND FOLLOWING THAT THEY'LL HIT  THE FIRST TRACES OF THE EARTH'S  ATMOSPHERE ABOUT 3 MINUTES  LATER. THEY'LL THEN ENTER THE PLASMA  REGIME WHICH LASTS ABO  MINUTES WHEN TEMPERATURES AROUND THE SPACECRAFT GO TO 200500  DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. THIS IS THE TIME WE EXPECT TO  LOSE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE  SOYUZ AND THE GROUND TEAMS. BUT THOSE WILL BE RESTORED WHEN  THAT 26 AIRCRAFT ON ITS WAY TO  THE LANDING SITE FROM BIKE  EVERYTHING MOVING ALONG AS  PLANNED FOR SOYUZ TONIGHT. SEPARATION. UNTIL MODULE  YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LIVE VIEW OF THE RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL A  TOWN OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW. YOU MAY HEAR THIS TEAM REFER TO  THE SOYUZ MS-15 AS THE CALL SIGN THAT OLEGPOCHKA CHOSE FOR  THE SOYUZ. IT'S BEEN ABOUT 10 MINUTES SINCE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE  BURN AND WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT 40  MINUTES UNTIL LANDING. LANDING OF THE CREW TONIGHT  LITTLE LOOK DIFFERENT AS IT'S  USUALLY STAGED. THAT AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED BY  KAZAKHSTAN AUTHORITIES SO THE  LANDING IS BEING STAGED OUT OF  ABOUT A 2.5 HOUR HELICOPTER  FLIGHT FROM THE LANDING S AFTER LANDING THE CREW WILL  RETURN BY RUSSIAN HELICOPTERS TO THAT STAGING CITY OF BAIKONUR  AND THEN WE'LL SPLIT UP AND THEN A THREE HOUR RIDE ON THE GROUND  TO THE AIRPORT WHERE THEY'LL  DEPART FOR ELLINGTON FIELD IN  HOUSTON ON A GULF STREAM  AIRCRAFT. MEANWHILE OLEG SKRIPOCHKA WILL  RETURN TO STAR CITY, RUSSIA. WHERE ABOUT 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM MODULE EXCEPT PRAYING. THINGS WILL START MOVING VERY  QUICKLY FOR THE SOYUZ CREW AFTER THAT. AT 11:53 THEY'LL HIT THE FIRST  TRACES AND TWO MINUTES LAT  E INTO THE PLASMA REGIME. PLASMA REGIME IS WHEN WE EXPECT  TO LOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE  CREW AND THEN THEY'LL EXIT THAT  REGIME AT MIDNIGHT CENTRAL TIME, EXPERIENCING 4 TO 5G'S AT THAT  IMTOO. THAT'S THE MAXIMUM G LOAD THEY  SHOULD FEEL DURING THEIR RETURN. 2 MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT THE  PARACHUTE WILL BEGIN. WE'LL SEE THE TWO PILOT  PARACHUTE AND SECOND WHICH WILL  DISTRACT THE TKROEG SHOOT. THAT DISTRACTS THE MAIN KHAOUT  COVERING AN AREA OF 1,000 MET AND THAT WLLOW IT TO A  DESCENT RATE OF 7.2 METERS PER  SECOND. IT SLOWS IT TO 1.5 METERS PER  SECOND. ONCE AGAIN ARE, LANDING IS  SCHEDULED FOR 12:16 A.M. CENTRAL TIME THE 47.19 DEGREES NORTH  LATITUDE AND 69.34 DEGREES EACH  LONGITUDE ABOUT 92 MILES AWAY  FROM JESSICA STAN AND  KAZAKHSTAN. THE CREW HAS REPORTED THEY  CLOSED AS WE ARE PHI MINUTES  AWAY FROM THE MODULE SEPARATION  OF THE SOYUZ. THE ORBITAL MODULE HAS ALREADY  BEEN DEPRESSURIZED TO A VACUUM  AND THE SYSTEMS ARE READY FOR  THE PYROTECHNIC SEPARATION. SOYUZ APPROACHES ITS MODULE  SEPARATION HERE ON THE GROUND,  THE HELICOPTERS ARE AT THE  LANDING SITE CIRCLING THE  LANDING ZONE IN RACE TRACK  FASHION HAVING DEPARTED  GENTLEMEN KA STAN EARLIER ABOUT  A 35 MINUTE FLIGHT AWAY. ONCE THE SPACECRAFT LANDS THE  HELICOPTERS WILL LAND  SEQUENTIALLY AND TEND TO THE  CREW. COMING UP ON TWO MINUTES UNTIL  MODULE EXCEPT PRAYING AT  11:50:44 P.M. CENTRAL TIME. PAEURPB PARPB   MINUTE REMAINS UNTIL THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT IS GUIDED INTO THREE  PORTIONS. PREPARING IT FOR RE-ENTRY INTO  THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. WE HAVE MODULE SEPARATION RIGHT  ON TIME. THE DESCENT MODULE APART FROM  THE ORBITAL MODULE AND  PROPULSION HOED YOU'LL ON ITS  WAY BACK TO EARTH. IN ABOUT THREE MINUTES THE CREW  WILL HIT THE FIRST TRACES OF  EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. THAT WILL BE THEIR FIRST TIME TO FEEL GRAVITY IN MONTHS AND 1.5  MINUTE LATER THEY'LL ENTER THE  PLASMA REGIME. THAT'S WHEN WE'LL LOSE  COMMUNICATION WITH THE CREW FOR  ABOUT 5 MINUTES. ABOUT 2 MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT  THE PARACHUTES WILL DEPLOY. THE SOFT LANDING ENGINES FIRING  JUST SECONDS BEFORE LANDING IN  KAZAKHSTAN.  BEEN ONE MINUTE AWAY UNTIL THE  CREW ENTERS THE INTERFACE  PORTION OF THEIR RETURN AND  THEY CAN EXPTO FEEL 4-5G'S I DURING THIS PORTION. SOYUZ CREW OF ASTRONAUTS ANDREW  MORGAN AND JESSICA MEIR AND OLEG SCRIPT SCRIPT SHOULD BE IN THE  ENTRY PHASE. AT 11:55 P.M CENTRAL TIME  THEY'LL ENTER THE PLASMA REGIME. WHEN THE TEMPERATURES WILL BUILD TO 200500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BUT THE HEAT SHIELD IS PROTECTING  THE ASTRONAUTS AND COSMONAUT  INSIDE.500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT B  THE HEAT SHIELD IS PROTECTING  THE ASTRONAUTS AND COSMONAUT  INSIDE. UPON THE EXIT FROM THE PLASMA  REGIME THE SOYUZ WILL HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE  COMMUNICATION ONCE IT'S IN THE  RANGE OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE'LL HEAR A BEACON SIGNAL ONCE  THAT RETURNS. THAT'S 2 MINUTES AFTER MIDNIGHT. SOYUZ IS NOW IN THAT PLASMA  REGIME AND IT SHOULD LAST 5  MINUTES AND THEY FEEL 4 HF 5G,  THE MOST THEY'LL FEEL UNTIL THEY RETURN TO EARTH. ON THE GROUND THE HELICOPTERS  AND NASA AND RUSSIAN CREWS ARE  WAITING FOR THE SPACECRAFT TO  RE-ENTRY THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT IS 20  MINUTES FROM LANDING. 92 MILES AWAY FROM JESSICA  . TWO MINUTES UNTIL THE CREW EXITS THE PLASMA REGIME. JUST MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE EXIT  FROM THE PLASMA ARE REGIME FROM  THE CREW AND MAXIMUM G'S THEY'LL FEEL ON THEIR RETURN TO EARTH. THE CREWS SHOULD BE OUT OF THE  PLASMA REGIME AND THE SECOND  STEP IS TO OPEN THOSE PARACHUTE. THAT SHOULD OPEN UNTIL 12:02:12  CENTRAL TIME. WE REGAINED COMMUNICATIONS WITH  THE CREW AND THEY REPORTED THEY  ARE FEELING WELL. THOSE DATA AND FLIGHT VOICE  BEING RELAYED FROM THE WING  AIRCRAFT FLYING NEAR THE LANDING SITE. IN ABOUT ONE MINUT SOYUZ WILL  OPEN ITS PARACHUTE AND WE ARE 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM SOYUZ LANDING. IN THE COMMAND TO OPEN THE  BE COMING RIGHT ABOUT NOW AS  IT'S 6.5 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH.  FIRST OF THOSE PARACHUTE WILL  BE TWO PILOT PARACHUTE AND  SECOND OF WHICH EXTRACTS THE  DROGUE CHUTE. IT MEASURES 24 SQUARE METERS AND THAT WILL SLOW THE SAY USE RATE  FROM 230 METERS PER SECOND TO  JUST 80 METERS PER SECOND. OF A THE DROGUE CHUTE IS  RELEASED THE MAIN PAIR CHUTE  WILL BE RELEASED AND SLOWS THE  SAY USE TO A DESCENT RATE TO 7.2 METERS PER SECOND. THE HARNESS IS ON THE PARACHUTE  WILL AW THE SOYUZ TO DESEND  AND SHIFT IT TO A STRAIGHT  VERTICAL DESCENT. AT ABOUT 21,321,000 FEET ABOVE  THE EARTH A BAROMETRIC SENSOR  TRIGGERS  MOST OF THE LANDING  EVENTS IN THE SEQUENCE. UNDER CLEAR BLUE SKY FOR THE  SOYUZ TODAY. WE HAVE TYPICALLY BEING SEEING  SOMETHING CALLED VENTED. ALL THE VALVES WILL NOT OPEN TO  VENT THE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE FOR  THE THRUSTERS AND THE OXYGEN IN  THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM TANK. DUE TO THIS IS A WHITE VAPER IS  EMITTED. THATS INTENDED TO SAVE THE  VEHICLE FROM LANDING SO THERE  AREN'T ANY HAZARD DOES GASES  REMAINING IN THE TANK WHEN THEY  FIRE JUST ABOUT TWO SECONDS  BEFORE SOYUZ TOUCHES DOWN. SEARCH AND ROFRY TEAMS ARE IN  COMMUNICATION WITH THE SOYUZ  CREW AND CONTINUE TO BE FEELING  WELL DURING THEIR DESENT TO  EARTH.   THE CREW IS NOW ABOUT 10  MINUTES AWAY FROM SCHEDULED  LANDING. YOU SHOULD BE FLOATING UNDER  CLEAR AND CLOUDLESS BLUE SKIES  MILES SOUTHEAST TO BE SPECIFIC. THAT'S 7.2 FOOT WIDE AND 6.9  FOOT HIGH DESCENT MODULE  COVERING AN AREA OF 1,000 METERS AND MAKING THE CAPSULE BELOW IT  APPEAR PRETTY SMALL. GROUND TEAMS REPORTING THAT THE  VEHICLE IS IN          SIGHT. VEHICLE IS IN      S SISIGHT.\n. WE'RE ABOUT 8 MINUTES AWAY FROM  THE SCHEDULED LANDING OF THE  SOYUZ MS-15 NOT CREW. NASA'S JESSICA MEIR AND ANDREW  MORGAN AND OLEG SKRIPOCHKA  MAKING THEIR RETURN TO EARTH. SEARCH AND RECOVERY FORCES ARE  CURRENTLY IN AIR IN THE MI-8  HELICOPTERS CIRCLING THE LANDING SITE AND AWAITING THE VEHICLE TO TOUCHDOWN.    VENT AND E HEAT. CLEAR CLEAR G AND EXPEL HEAT. CLEAR CLEAR   SEARCH AND RECOVERY FORCES ARE  IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE CREW  STILL FLEETING DOWN TO LAND 92  MILES SOUTHEAST OF ZHEZKAZGAN,  VERY DESOLATE BUT GREAT WEATHER  TODAY. 61 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. SOYUZ WILL CONTINUE ON WITH ITS  PARACHUTE. THE NEXT MILESTONE AND THE LAST  MILESTONE BEFORE LANDING BEING  THAT SOFT LANDING ENGINE FIRING: 6 ENGINES WHICH WILL SLOW IT TO  1.5 METERS PER SECOND WHEN IT'S  LESS THAN ONE METER ABOVE THE  GROUND. THE MI-8 HELICOPTERS HAVE EYES  ON THE VEHICLE. THEY ARE NOW FOLLOWING TO THE  LANDING SITE AND EVERY ONE  REPORTS THAT THEY ARE FEELING  WELL. PAEURPB PARPB  JUST TWO MINUTES AWAY FROM THE  SCHEDULED LANDING OF THE SOYUZ  MS-15.  WERE ONE MINUTE AWAY THE  SCHEDULED LANDING OF JESSICA  MEIR, ALEX  SKRIPOCHKA AND  ANDREW MORGAN. PAEURPB  WE'RE WEIGHTING WAITING OF THE  CONFIRMATION OF THE LANDING OF  THE MS-15 CREW. WE'RE WAITING FOR NOT THE  CONFIRMATION OF THE RETURN OF  OLEG SKRIPOCHKA AND JESSICA MEIR AND ANDREW MORGAN. WE'RE WAITING THAT CONFIRMATION. WE NOT CONFIRMED LANDING OF THE  CREW AT APPROXIMATELY 1:16 A.M.  EASTERN TIME AND 11:16 COUNTIES  KAZAKHSTAN TIME. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPORTED BY THE RUSSIAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY  FORCES TO ON ITS SIDE. THOSE MI-8 HELICOPTERS SHOULD BE LANDING SHORTLY TO EXTRACT THE  CREW FROM THE SOYUZ MODULE. THEY LANDED AT APPROXIMATELY  12:16 CENTRAL TIME AND  11:16 A.M. LOCAL TIME KAZAKHSTAN TIME. THE RUSSIAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY  FORCES REPORTED THAT THE VEHICLE IS ON IT'S SIDE AND THE MI-8  HELICOPTERS HAVE NOW LANDED AND  WILL BEGIN THE RECOVERY PROCESS  OF THE CREW. THIS IS A VIEW OF THE RUSSIAN  MISSION CONTROL CENTER. TO RECAP, HAVING RANKED AT ITS  SCHEDULED TIME APPROXIMATELY  12:16 A.M. CENTRAL TIME. THE VEHICLE LANDED ON ITS SIDE  AS REPORTED BY RUSSIAN SEARCH  AND RECOVERY. AROUND THE CAPSULE AND ROARKING  TO RETRIEVE AND EXTRACT THE  CREW. THIS AGENCY VIEW FROM THE  BALCONY OF THE RUSSIAN MISSION  CONTROL CENTER OUTSIDE OF  MOSCOW. THIS IS WHERE LANDING OPERATIONS WERE CONTROLLED TONIGHT.IS   A PAEURPB PAEURPB THEY CONTINUE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOYUZ  CREW AFTER TOUCHING AT  APPROXIMATELY 12:16 A.M. CENTRAL TIME. AGAIN, AS WE REPORTED EARLIER,  RUSSIAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY  FORCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE  SOYUZ ISS SIDE. NOT UNUSUAL. IT LANDED AND POTENTIALLY FULLED PULLED OVER BY ITS ORANGE AND  WHITE PARACHUTE COVERING AN AREA OF 1,000 METERS. WE'RE HOPE TO GET A VIDEO OF THE LANDING SITE TO SEE FOOTAGE OF  THE CREW BEING EXTRACTED PRIOR  TO THEIR DEPARTURE FOR BAIKONUR  AND RESPECTIVE HOMES IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND STAR CITY, OUTSIDE OF  MOSCOW. IT WAS REPORTED EARLIER THAT  THEY'RE ON THE GROUN WITH SOYUZ HAVING LAND ON THOSE MI-8  HELICOPTERS. THEY'LL SAVE THE VEHICLE AND  THEN EXTRACTING THE CREW. IT ILL WITH BE THE FIRST TIME  OUTSIDE IN 6 MONTHS FOR ALEX AND JESSICA AND 9 MONTHS FOR ANDREW  MORGAN. WITH THE FOURTH SINGLE LONGEST  AMERICAN.ION FOR AN  WE HAVE VIDEO OF THE LANDING  SITE. YOU CAN SEE THE SOYUZ IS ON ITS  SIDE AND SEARCH AND RECOVERY ARE WORKING TO EXTRACT THE CREW FROM THE CAPSULE. YOU CAN SEE TEAMS WEARING MASKS. THIS IS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE  AND PART OF THE PRE PLANNED  MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY THE  RUSSIAN SEARCH AND RECOVERY IN  ORDER TO PROTECT ALL INVOLVED IN THE RECOVERY OF THE CREW AND THE CREW THEMSELVES. WE'VE GOT A VIEW OF COMMANDER  OLEG SKRIPOCHKA, FIRST OUT OF  THE HATCH. >> WELCOME BACK, GUYS. PLEASE KEEP THE DISTANCE AS THE  PRESIDENT HAS TOLD US. HE PROBABLY CAN'T RECOGNIZE  ANYBODY WITH ALL THESE MASKS. AGAIN THAT'S COMMANDER  SKRIPOCHKA AFTER SPENDING 205  DAYS BRINGING HIS CAREER TOTAL  TO 536. SKRIPOCHKA IS SEATED OUTSIDE OF  THE CAPSULE AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY AT THE LANDING SITE. BOUT 61 TKPWRAOEZ FAHRENHEIT. ONCE ANDREW MORGAN AND JESSICA  MEIR ARE BROUGHT OUT THEY'LL BE  ABLE TO SIT DOWN AS WELL TO GET  EQUILIBRIUM BEFORE BEING MOVED  TO THE HELICOPTERS. SKRIPOCHKA DONNINGOME  SUNGLASSES AFTER NOT  EXPERIENCING SUNLIGHT LIKE THAT  FOR OVER 205 DAYS. AND NOW OUT OF THE CAPSULE NASA  ASTRONAUT JESSICA MEIR AFTER  RETURNING 205 DAYS FROM SPACE. HER FIRST MISSION ABOARD THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. JESSICA MEIR SHARING SMILES  AFTER DOCTORS CONDUCT A POST  MEDICAL CHECK. WE HAVE THE EXTRACTION OF ANDREW MORGAN AFTER RETURNING AFTER 272 DAYS, ALMOST 9 MONTHS ON HIS  FIRST MISSION AWAY FROM EARTH. LANDING AT APPROXIMATELY 12:16  CENTRAL I'M AND 11:16 KAZAKHSTAN TIME EARTH REGAINED THREE OF ITS RESIDENCE OLEG SKRIPOCHKA,  JESSICA MEIR AND ANDREW MORGAN. CREW MEMBERS ARE GETTING THE  CHANCE TO TALK WITH FAMILY  MEMBERS ON THE PHONE. THEY'LL SOON HELICPTERS  IN THEIR WHITE SUITS, THOSE  SUITS YOU SEE THEM WEARING NOW. THEY'LL THEN CHANGE INSIDE  HELICOPTERS FOR A 2.5 FLIGHT TO  BAIKONUR AND THAT'S WHERE  THEY'LL SPLIT UP FOR THE FIRST  TIME IN 6 MONTHS. SKRIPOCHKA WILL BOARD THE PLANE  OR TRAINING CENTER IN BAIKONUR. ASTRONAUT JESSICA MEIR BACK ON  EARTH AFTER 205 DAYS AND THREE  HISTORIC SPACEWALKS. THE FIRST ALL FEMALE SPACEWALK  WITH HER FRIEND AND CREWMATE  CHRISTINA KOCH. AND ANOTHER LOOK AT NASA  ASTRONAUT DREW MORGAN SMILING  GETTING HIS FIRST BREATH OF  FRESH AIR AFTER 9 MONTHS ABOARD  THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. NASA DOCTORS CONDUCTING THAT  POST LANDING MEDICAL CHECK  ENSURING EVERYTHING IS GOING  WELL FOR ANDREW MORGAN AND  JESSICA MEIR AFTER THEIR RETURN  TO EARTH.

THEY'LL CHANGE OUT OF THEIR  SUITS INTO SOME MORE COMFORTABLE FLIGHT SUITS ALONG THE WAY  BEFORE SPLITTING UP UPON LANDING AND RETURNING TO THEIR  RESPECTIVE HOMESN STAR CITY,  MOSCOW AND HOUSTON, TEXAS.  ONLY 4 HOURS AGO THIS TRIO  UNDOCKED FROM THE PORT OF THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, THE SOYUZ PERFORMING WELL ON THE WAY DOWN AND BRINGING THEM TO LAND  ABOUT 92 MILES SOUTHEAST OF  ZHEZKAZGAN, KAZAKHSTAN. THAT LANDING TIME CONFIRMED AT  11:16 KAZAKHSTAN TIME, ABOUT 5  HOURS AFTER SUNRISE AT THE  LANDING SITE. THE CREW APPEARING TO BE DOING  WELL AND IN GOOD SPIRITS AND NOW ANDREW MORGAN SPEAKING ON  PRESIDENT TELEPHONE LIKELY WITH  FAMILY MEMBERS. CLEAR LEAR MORE SMILES FROM JESSICA  MEIR AND FIRST PHOTOS AND YOU  SEE COMMANDER OLEG SKRIPOCHKA TO ATV'S THAT WILL DRIVE THEM A  SHORT DISTANCE. ONCE INSIDE THE HELICOPTERS  THEY'LL CHANGE OUT OF THEIR  SUITS INTO MORE COMFORTABLE  LIGHT SUITS BEFORE RETNING TO  BAIKONUR. SKRIPOCHKA ALREADY ON HIS FEET  AND CLIMBING INTO THE ATV AND  PREPARING FOR A HELICOPTER RIDE  FOR ABOUT 2.5 HOURS. AND JESSICA MEIR NOW BEING MOVED WAVING AT THE CAMERA ON HERWAY  TO THE ATV AND THAT WILL DRIVE   A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE  HELICOPTER WAITING NEARBY. AS WE MENTIONED SUCCESSFUL  LANDING AT A CONFIRMED  12:16 A.M. CENTRAL TIME AND  11:16 A.M. LOCAL TIME AND 5  HOURS AFTER SUNRISE AT THE  LANDING SITE. WE GOT A GOOD CREW OHE THREE  CREW MEMBERS, ALEX SKRIPOCHKA  AND NASA ASTRONAUTS ANDREW  MORGAN AND JESSICA MEIR HAVING  BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT. IT LANDED AND TILT TO DO ITS  SIDE AND THE CREW ARE DOING WELL AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO DROP  THEIR SUITS AS SOON AS THEY  RIVE IN THOSE MI-8  HELICOPTERS. THOSE HELICOPTERS WILL TAKE THEM TO A 2.5 HOUR FLIGHT TO BACK  INNOR AND AFTER LANDING THEY'LL  SPLIT UP AND NASAM GOING ON  AN ABOUT THREE HOUR RIDE IN SOME VEHICLE THAT WILL DRIVE THEM TO  THE NASA PLANE FOR THEIR FLIGHT  HOME. YOU'RE LOOK AT A LIVE VIEW IN  THE RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL  CENTER OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW WHERE  THE TEAMS CONTROLLED A  SUCCESSFUL LANDING OPERATION OF  THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT BRINGING  WITH IT NASA ASTRONAUT ANDREW  MORGAN RETURNING FROM 272 DAYS  FROM SPACE AND HIS FIRST MISSION IS AS WELL AS NASA ASTRONAUT  JESSICA MEIR AND COMMANDER OF  THE SPACECRAFT ALEX SKRIPOCHKA,  BOTH ACHIEVING 205 DAYS ON THIS  MISSION. LANDING WASFUL AND  TOUCHDOWN AT 12:16 A.M. CENTRAL  TIME. THE CREW HAS BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE VEHICLE. THEY'LL BOARD HELICOPTERS AND  MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARD THE  STAGING CITY OF BAIKONUR. TODAY'S JOURNEYOME FOR THE  SOYUZ MS-15 AND ITS CREW OF  ANDREW MORGAN AND OLEG  SKRIPOCHKA AND JESSICA MEIR  BEGAN AT 5:45 CENTRAL TIME. JUST A FEW HOURS LATER THE HOOKS ON THE SPACECRAFT WERE OPENED  AND THE SOYUZ MS-15 UKED  TAKING WITH IT ITS CREW. ALSO SYSTEMS EXECUTED  SUCCESSFULLY TONIGHT AND THE  SOYUZ TOUCHED DOWN ON THE  KAZAKHSTAN STEPS AT 12:16 A.M.  CENTRAL TIME, 11:16 A.M.  KAZAKHSTAN TIME. THAT BRINGS ANDREW MORGAN'S  MISSION TO AN END AFTER 272 DAYS AND HE'S NOW THE HOLDER OF  TIGHT THE FOR THE FOURTH LONGEST SINGLE SPACEFLIGHT BY A U.S.  ASTRONAUT. JESSICA MEIR'S MISSION ENDED  AFTER 205 DAYS. HER FIRST TRIP TO THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND  COMMANDER OF THE SOYUZ ALEX  SKRIPOCHKA ENDED HIS MISSION  AFTER 205 DAYS. HIS THIRD FLIGHT NOW TOTALLIN  536 DAYS IN HIS SPACEFLIGHT  CAREER. THE CREW WAS SUCCESSFULLY  EXTRACTED FROM THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT AND THE NEXT STEPS  FOR THEM ARE A 2.5 TO 3 HOUR  HELICOPTER FLIGHT TO BAIKONUR  AND CHANGE OUT OF THOSE LAUNCH  AND ENTRY SUITS INTO A MORE  COMFORTABLE SUITS AND AFTER  LANDING THEREPLIT UP  FOR THE TIME IN 6 MONTHS. ALEX SKRIPOCHKA WILL BOARD BACK  TO STAR CITY IN HIS HOME WHILE  THE NASA TEAM WILL MOVE TO  GROUND VEHICLES THAT WILL TAKE  THEM BACK TO THEIR FLIGHT BACK  TO ELLINGTON FIELD BACK IN  HOUSTON.

I WAS BORN ABOUT SIX YEARS AFTER THE LAST MOON LANDING. BUT IT WAS SUCH A MOMENTOUS EVENT, IT CHANGED FOREVER, THAT IT CREATED WHAT I WOULD CALL A COLLECTIVE MEMORY. GROWING UP I WOULD SEE IT INIS TO OR -- TOYS OR REPORTS ON TV, DOCUMENTARIES, I WOULD HEAR MY PARENTS TALK ABOUT IT AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, FOR THE FIRST 0 0 -- 10 OR 12 YEARS OF MY LIFE I GOING TO THE MOON.STILL I WAS NOT AWARE WE HAD STOPPED TRAVELING TO THE MOON LONG BEFORE I WAS BORN. SO IT GAVE ME A SENSE THAT GOING TO THE MOON AND BEING AN ASTRONAUT WAS SOMETHING POSSIBLE, DESPITE THE FACT I WAS BORN IN SICILY, THE PERIP OF EUROPE, FARAWAY FROM ANYTHING AEROSPACE RELATED. I THINK IT AFFECTEDME MORE WAYS THAN I CAN DESCRIBE BECAUSE IT GAVE ME THAT SENSE OF POSSIBILITY WHICH IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO COMMUNICATE WHEN I TALK TO STUDENTS AND YOUNG KIDS THAT THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. >> THAT WAS LUCA PARMITANO WHO WAS BOARD ENGINEER NUMBER ONE SEATED IN THE LEFT SEAT OF THE SOYUZ MS-13.

WITH THAT IN MIND, AND ALOOK AT THE CREW, LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DREW MORGAN, NASA'S NEXT ASTRONAUT TO FLY IN SPACE. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> I THINK I OFTEN DESCRIBE MYSELF AS A SOLDIER, A PHYSICIAN, AND AN ASTRONAUT. THE PURSUIT OF THOSE HAPPENED IN THAT ORDER. ONE OF THE EARLIEST MEMORIES I HAVE IS ALWAYS WANTING TO BE IN THE MILITARY, WANTING TO BE A SOLDIER. SERVICE IN OUR FAMILY, BOTH MY GRANDPARENTS, MY FATHER WAS AN AIR FORCE OFFICER AND I ALSO REMEMBERED MY PARENTS TELLING ME A STORY ABOUT MY GREAT UNCLE TERRY McCLINIC WHO WAS A PARATROOPER IN WORLD WAR II. HE WAS IN THE 101st AIRBORNE DIVISION AND JUMPED IN NORMANDY ON D-DAY AND JUMPED IN HOLLAND AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD OF A CONCEIT OF A PARATROOPER AND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN AIRBORNE SOLDIER. WHEN I LATER DECIDED AND GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND WENT TO WEST  I KNEW I WS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS CONCEPT OF BEING AN AIRBORNE SOLDIER. AT WEST POINT THEY HAD A PARACHUTE TEAM CALLED THE BLACK KNIGHTS. I MADE THE PARACHUTE TEAM AND THAT BECAME ONE OF THE CENTRAL ACTIVITIES OF MY REMAINING 3 1/2 YEARS OF AT WEST POINT. IN ADDITION TO ACAD AFT CLASS WE JUMPED MOST DAYS OF THE WEEK BUT WE WERE ALSO A DEMONSTRATION TEAM SO WE JUMPED IN FOOTBALL GAMES. WHILE I WAS A CADET I WENT THROUGH MILITARY BASIC AIRBORNE COURSE WHICH TAUGHT MILITARY STATIC LINE PARACHUTING. SPECIFICALLY THE PARACHUTE IF I GO ACK TO THE TIME, MY TEAM. TEAMMATES I WAS SELECTED WITH BECAME MY BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD AND CONTINUE TO BE TO THIS DAY. THE CAMARADERIE AND DEPENCY WE HAD IN EACH OTHER, OUR AIRCRAFT, SKILLS IN THE AIR, SAFETY CHECKS OF EACH OTHER, THAT TYPE OF CAMARADERIE IS SOMETHING I FEEL NOW WITH MY ASTRONAUT COLLEAGUES AS WELL. I THINK ABOUT HOW 20 YEARS AGO I WAS DEVELOPING THOSE SKILLS AT AN EARLY AGE AND DI EVEN KNOW IT. [ ♪♪♪ ] I'M ANDREW MORGAN AND I'M A SOLDIER, A PHYSICIAN, AND AN ASTRONAUT.

80,,Armstrong Hosts NASA 50th Anniversary Documentary,"Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 Commander and first person to walk on the moon, guides us through the history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the half-century since its establishment in 1958. Produced by NASA TV, 2008.",NASA,3TrNN_eTau0,"[""[Music] [Music] lived off in less than a century America has progressed from the sandy hills of Kitty Hawk along the Atlantic coast into the vast new ocean of space journeys been difficult and dangerous but it's also been rewarding it's given us a better understanding of our home planet our solar system and the universe although humans have dreamed of sailing outward from the planet Earth for centuries the realization of that vision began just five decades [Music] I had been working for NACA since 1945 as the young aeronautical engineer right out of college in airplane flight test and we were not interested in space at that time you were interested in high-speed aerodynamics the x-15 was being built there's the drop before it returns to earth again the x-15 may fly some 60 miles straight up at nearly 4000 miles per hour [Music] [Music] we were in Cold War that was darn close to hot war the Russians and and there was great concern both the sides had nuclear weapons you know we grew up fearing the Russians I can remember when I was in school going through drills where we got under our seats so this idea of them beating us in space was a pretty awesome idea they were claiming superiority and we didn't believe that but they had been launching some rockets and ours too often had been blowing up on the launch pad [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that was sort of the background to what happened then in 57 when they sent up Sputnik there's a Russian of satellite which is going over every 90 minutes beep and it didn't take much imagination to know that that could have been involved I remember being very surprised that they had done this and that we had not been able to do it ahead of them that was my main concern I think that was the main concern of most Americans at that time right then I think we all inwardly resolved that that one goal laughs would go do something about it it was just a faint beep a radio beacon coming from a shiny little orb circling the earth in 1957 Sputnik signaled the beginning of the Space Age and the United States was behind our first successful answer to Sputnik came with the launch of the Explorer 1 satellite and within the year the formation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration when I came up here in May of 1958 there was no Marshall Space Flight Center von Braun and his team were all part of what was called an army ballistic missile agency and it was that agency actually that built and launched the first Explorer satellites maybe panic we took enormous pride in that because although it followed Sputnik Explorer one had science instruments on it and so it really marks the first use of space for scientific exploration gave us the idea that we were surrounded by radiation belts that we knew nothing about no Barry [Music] so we were off and running as a result of Sputnik and it resulted of course in the establishment of NASA by President Eisenhower in the summer of 1958 we have one of the most challenging assignments that has ever been given to modern man we will be developing and launching into space vehicles needed to obtain scientific data and to explore the solar system we will be preparing for the day when manned flight goes into space [Music] Sieg Lennon was really outstanding in that period of drawing together the thoughts of the people in the organization and seeking people from outside of course I was a young punk at that time in those early years and I was a little hesitant about expressing myself but the way he worked it it got to a point where was very common for everyone to really Express how they felt until I the first active 58mm dr. maura and about 2,000 of us members of the team I guess all transitioned from the Army to Marshall we were blessed here because the leaders of all of our labs were original members of the Von Braun team and these guys were brilliant scientists they had been there they've done it they made mistakes they had blown up more rockets than anybody could ever conceive on and they were our Mentors I don't think but about once every hundred here's a person when blood Brown comes around he was top-notch engineer he was a top-notch scientists and but he had something that most other people don't have and he was a visionary you know it was crazy bad thing about going to the moon you know it was crazy in van brand-new we could do it and afterwards been around him for a while we have scientific knowledge with our smaller people since the Russians have with them up swapped out once we were trying to build satellites to try to get things going trying to catch up with the Russians passing by and a lot of exciting things were going all of those in those early days a near perfect take off guys like Max was Jay and nopales aircraft Research Division who had been designing these rockets over over at Wallops they had all been dreaming about man and space I remember walking into a match for Jays office and there on the wall he had a picture of a guy in the fetal position in a little caps ooh yeah I said what are you gonna do with that max he said well we're gonna launch a guy into space yeah I said well you know that like the G's are very very high he says oh yeah he'll black out but he'll come to we knew the Soviets we're gonna try and apply a man after they they launched their first satellite and the Soviets knew we were gonna try to do the same thing the nation was getting ready to put a man in space I mean that was a commitment and that was the focus we didn't know much about the space environment you know a young person like myself with no experience who was on an equal par with everybody there's no one had unique experience and it was it was exciting times and and any information you found was valuable and people were interested in it and looked at it [Music] but then when they opened this up for manned spaceflight and announced that program and one volunteers for it I thought that was a natural with the background I had of test flying and I met the criteria that they were shooting for I was a test pilot and the job of a test pilot is to fly new airplanes here with the dawn of space flight was an opportunity to fly an airplane of a sort that made an order-of-magnitude jump in height altitude and speed and distance and they were trying to convince it how neat it would be to get in a capsule on top of a rocket I said no way send that idiot that goes out of the cannon in the circus let him land on a net and forget us there's no no don't don't worry we're gonna put some monkeys and chimpanzees in first now I know I want out of here so I really had a very negative opinion of it before the first flight we will have developed our Mercury spaceship to the point where it will be as reliable as man can devise today we are introducing to you and the world these seven men who have been selected to begin training for orbital space flight I feel that this is the future of not only this country but the world we've gone about as far as we can on this globe and we have to start looking around a bit and it's just the natural expansion of flight Project Mercury is just one part of the endeavor - its space travel I got on this project because it'd probably be the nearest to heaven not ever yet no one to make the most of it these ladies and gentlemen are the nation's mercury astronauts [Applause] [Music] echo was 100 feet in diameter and it was one of the biggest challenges that we had in like in communication involving the use of the satellite balloon [Music] the real thing that came out of it was that every buyer the world saw it they knew that the United States was in the spaceman convincing others that humans could do a job in space that's what we were up to in Project Mercury a 98% of the medical community in the United States did not think the man could survive in that environment much less do a job and that was very important to the future of manned spaceflight because it allowed us to take advantage of the human beings thinking capacity his intelligence and it simplified the design of the spacecraft frankly and none of us had ever ever seen a missile launch and so five four three two one and the booster launches and it the big flame and we're standing there walking up like this and here are these seven budding astronauts watching as it goes up in his twenty seven thousand feet and blew and it just looked like an atomic bomb went off over our head up there and I remember I was looking at each other and saying we got to talk to some engineers tomorrow there was the initial launch that any of us had ever seen that the Cape nopales aircraft the division is actually the division that got us into space because I work from acts with J and Max version a of course is the one who did the mercury capsule and invented that completely I'll tell you it became immediately apparent to me the only practical approach was was was on I I had to propose simply because it provided the lightest way to do it our best launch vehicle was Atmos the mercury the only one who had a chance to be made light enough to be able to make orbit on Atlas we didn't call it mercury that day we still call it the capsule the concept we came up with was it was a primate from Mercury I'm a bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum dang dang dang then you donned a room and then we started launching monkeys and then chimpanzees and then they launched Yuri Gagarin we were totally tricked by that Yuri Gagarin and the Soviets got there first and that was a terrible disappointment for the nation and for us of course Yuri Gagarin was launched into Earth orbit in 1961 the United States still wasn't there but the 60s were a decade of change and NASA would forever change the course of human exploration we were getting telegrams like mad from all over the country from The Associated nurse Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ASPCA please stop washing these chimpanzees so we launched Alan Shepard I always think that Alan Shepards flight was a fantastic moment in the history of NASA and the history of manned spaceflight but I think back on that and I watched him come out of that band on the redstone pad and look up at that rocket in that silver suit he had on and all those lights flashing and then people looking at him and watching and wondering himself what the hell he was doing there getting up on top of this rocket [Music] I think the biggest surprise I had a whole series of events of the space program because after Shepards flight weeks President Kennedy said I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth I thought that is the most audacious thing I have ever heard in my entire life are we serious about this remember now when he said that we had met to orbit the first man in this country John Glenn was 10 months away from flying most of us thought he was really stretching the point and frankly I thought he was a Bismarck we didn't really even have computers at the start of this we were all still using our slide rules because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won he was asking us to do with most people at the time thought couldn't be done but he was doing it in an environment in which the Soviet Union literally own space and he laid the gauntlet down American people picked it got lit up and got to a point where they didn't know it couldn't be done not because they are easy but because they are hard that was all heady stuff and we were all you know go go man go so to go to orbital speed do you have to go 17,000 300 miles an hour that's how fast you have to go to balance gravity so the first manned flight for orbit was John Glenn doctors were concerned for instance that when you're in zero-g for a while for several hours you're afraid your eyes might change shape that you wouldn't be able to even keep your vision on the instrument panel so we were out to prove what those things did not make the difference but and that's what that first light was all about [Music] [Applause] when John flew he saw these glowing particles at sunset and they look a little like Firefly so he told the ground its fireflies and it was a major mystery but I could create these fireflies by wrapping on the side of the spacecraft it turned out they were little chips of ice and they fly past the window like a firefly might my mission ended up being controversial because I overshot of the landing by I think 200 miles so my flight did contribute a lot of new knowledge to the science of space flight and it took the form of redesign but all flights do that you know we stand on the shoulders of those who go before us whether or not they overshoot the interesting part of the mercury mission of Sigma 7 was that we were over the South Atlantic and prior to that mission the Russians had set off a nuclear bomb at high altitude so at radiation devices they would measure 10 Rankin's 5 Rankin's 1 Rankine and 1/2 rank or something like that I didn't get a reading on any of those things so it turned out we were ok so we could go on and let Cooper go over the South Atlantic over many many times it truly was the Age of Aquarius in the 60s the mood around us was always electric the press revered the astronauts and it revered those of us in the front of the program they looked up to us and we felt the responsibility so the feeling was mutual the country supported what we did [Music] we were pushing technology [Music] communications hot lights of course came into being and a lot of other neat things have happened as a result of that technology push the country was trying to build a supersonic transport at least to do some research and build some prototypes so by trying to study the flow fields about these vehicles trying to compute the sonic booms and their propagation to the ground was a very interesting man challenging problem there was a lot of interest in must largely because of the publicity which the planet received at the hands of Percival Lowell in the early 1900's he reported that he saw canals [Music] we've made out a pretty good case that the planet must have intelligent life won and so a lot of interested environment for them because of successfully flown past Mars taking some photographs as it went by the most important piece of data from Mariner 4 was the photograph number 11 which showed very clearly a crater which looked just like the craters on the moon although by today's standards the quality of these pictures are pretty poor they were definitely showing that Mars were much more like the moon than it was like the earth Gemini was the program between Mercury of the single seater in Earth orbit and Apollo the three seater all the way to the moon liftoff Germany of course carried two people but I wasn't the people that it carried it was the concepts Germany was a great program because we learned how to operate in space how to do EBA how to use computers so what we did with Germany we did rendezvous which I was very thrilled to do we did the docking we did the change of orbit we did a precise reentry all of those were very important to the [Music] company 12 Houston Capcom there wiII be a record beautiful job [Music] Apollo 1 was to be the first man test of the Apollo spacecraft so it was a real shocker to find that we lost a crew not in space but right there on the pad the fire on the pad was a traumatic event it ripped us apart to be perfectly honest with you a terrible day [Music] we were not doing a good job we were running too fast it forced us to reconsider what we were doing and do job properly but I thought having happened I don't think we would have gotten to the moon in the sixties five weeks later as the backup crew we inherited the first manned Apollo mission which turned out the Apollo 7 but as there were many things with NASA what was a disaster with Apollo 1 turned out to be a real triumph with Apollo 7 because the spacecraft itself was a was a marvelous flying machine it went 11 days so we were quite proud of the fact that we took and had a triumph out of a disaster and that was what Apollo 7 did for me it proved that we could do all the things we set out to do and do it well this is Apollo fat on launch control we had bill go at this time - - 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 we have ignition sequence start the engines around 4 3 2 1 0 [Music] we have [Music] [Music] the first Fulop Saturn launch of all the rockets went to the moon with humans on it they need him tested individual stages they just stack them all up stuck my people up and says let's try it out send to the moon [Music] what I wonder coming to you approximately halfway between the moat of the earth we have about 40 hours left to go to the top the first time we flew a crew on the big Saturn 5 we sent them to the moon for 10 orbits not just this way around the back very bold decision on Apollo 8 when we wrote into the spacecraft and soften the very first time the far side of the moon only 60 miles below we were like three school kids looking into a candy store window kind of forgot the flight plan for a second as those ancient old craters on the far side slowly slipped by [Music] [Music] frankly I wasn't too optimistic that Apollo 11 would actually land and actually return somebody's successfully I I thought we'd get a get away with our lives I wasn't too worried about that but I just thought there were so many unknowns that I would have given us about a 50/50 chance of being the first flight to land and return someone safely [Music] like the fellers gonna go for landing retro no I don't control oh oh no surgeon go Capcom we're go for landing altitude 4200 thing you're go for landing over there are certain events in life that you never forget and they the lunar landing and in particular the last seconds leading up to the landing will never be forgotten we battled to get to the surface we're halfway to our abort limit about the time we got that started out we started having a series of computer program alarms and as the crew took over at about two minutes prior to landing searching for a landing site we knew that they were going to be using a lot more fuel than we expected have a good feeling about just how far they were nasty man even though they kept going and going and going what were our chances of landing successfully getting outside that was pretty easy to do it was touching down so that later missions could touch down and then do the rest of the stuff but the landing with 15 seconds of fuel remaining that was even important thing for were driven to the right level I'm back right okay engine stop we got to get down and go with a gaudy babe here he go I landed it was like Jewess rocket tranquility we can't be on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue we're breathing again thanks a lot okay keep the chatter down in this room the unfortunate thing is no controller had an opportunity to absorb the emotion of that landing because we had to work for the next two hours non-stop okay you want stay no stay retro Hey right Oh State Patrol calm ANC thank God thanks urgent hey Capcom or state forty-one and we're getting a picture on the TV have you had a good picture up and tell that moment television have always been a goal but not a requirement once we landed safely the only thing that counted was for us to see the picture step off the LEM now what I felt at that moment was the TV better worker else and if it doesn't really really will Know Who I am because I'll be the man who didn't bring you television from the night that's one small step for man [Music] the world just marveled at this right along with us and we more or less made the whole world our partners in this thing by inviting people to be there I think that's one of the best things we ever we ever did in the space program and one of the best decisions ever made with regard the space program was to share that with the world I think it was the biggest event from an aviation point of view and probably from a scientific point of view that happened in the 20th century and maybe in history of man Peyman aids for all mankind [Music] it over [Music] but we had a good time on Apollo 12 and so we were happy to go and anxious to for the great adventure and so off we go and we go into a thunderstorm immediately after launch and get hit by lightning and it lights up a lot of caution and warning lights and we didn't know what to do thank God for Mission Control because they came up and gave us some advice and and so we powered it back up again with their help and everything worked out okay we went into orbit and then off to the moon they landed us perfectly if we had not touched the controls we would have landed right in the middle of the crater that we were shooting for so they wouldn't have missed it by 10 feet and when you figure we went 240 thousand miles that's pretty amazing shows you the kind of capability that NASA has so we got out for that time and we can place some experiments and then we collected a lot of rocks and made some observations and then our primary job had been to land near surveyor which was an unmanned spacecraft that had landed on the moon in the ocean of storms some 33 months earlier that look so we were going to land there and pick up some parts like the TV camera and the scoop and things like that bring him back to earth for evaluation [Music] Apollo 13 was a team effort from very beginning to the end when the crew threw the switches to start the crowd stir a spark jump between the fan and the heater assembly and the pressure in that tank rose very rapidly because the insulation had been damaged on the system and we now had a fire inside the tank that blew the dome of the tank off that series of events started the saga of Apollo 13 and we had a pretty large Bank though they did with the they exact words I used in Mission Control is we have never lost an American in space and we sure as hell aren't gonna lose one this crew is coming home you gotta believe it your team must believe it and we must make it happen when we suddenly realized the truth is significance of the explosion seeing the oxygen escape from the rear of my spacecraft and consequently losing all the electrical power and the propulsion system we knew we were in serious trouble you called in your backup becomes now see if we can get some more brain power and then we got one here ROG throughout the entire Apollo 13 mission the teams and Mission Control changed shifts almost regularly at eight-hour intervals and the teams kept the mission going kept working the problem as my team's tried to come up with the answers go ahead like I want you to get some guys figuring out minimum power in the LEM to sustain life fortunately the lunar module was attached to us and when that occurred with oxygen almost gone and the command module we transferred the command to the lunar module and try to use it somehow some way as a lifeboat to get home let's solve the problem but let's not make it any worse by guessing I got a lot of recognition for the work that we did but the real heroes of Apollo 13 were the people in the back rooms and over in the engineering facilities who came up with the answers we needed we never talked among ourselves about not making it back home it was like playing a game of solitaire as long as we had a card and we could put it someplace the game kept going and every crisis that we came up to we found a solution as we rounded the moon and my two companions looked at the place where we were supposed to land and there very much disappointment I said we're on our way home let's get home successfully forget about Delaney and then what all silent big business is that right for the whole panel is blown out almost to the Apollo 13 has to rate with anything we ever do because it took a great deal of ingenuity a great deal of preparation years of preparation a lot of guts on the part of the astronauts themselves to bring that off [Applause] [Music] and so you have to say that Apollo 13 was a fantastic moment in the history of manned spaceflight I will tell you that we had one of the most bodacious splashdown parties that I can remember and those guys got back [Music] [Applause] [Music] about that I'm going out ballet when I get back you learn another line of work up here god you're just beautiful that is that is the most beautiful sight but there you're standing arrow around that crater god I never heard John describe this beautifully not really well actually he is on this thing [Music] [Music] now I said I can't see to the bottom of it Naaman put there because I'm going to get all the different steps and all the different pieces of hardware and all op it had to work and this just inconceivable that we could do something like them the motivation was well honey and then gonna be my pocket screws up you know I'm gonna get it right and apparently everybody else felt the same way and we did it and did it and did it [Music] Apollo 17 was probably one of the more interesting missions because we had a real geologist there and they landed in a you know you know wonderfully interesting place the valley of taurus-littrow was picked as a landing site for a couple different reasons and were one it was in an area the moon we had never even come close to and it was a valley some 20 miles long and five miles across which was literally surrounded by mountain is higher than a Grand Canyon is deep [Music] yeah what point two kilometers is a long way from the left look at the Challenger down there they could get a feel for how big to fail he really is we stopped obviously at a lot of different planned places and we did everything from drilling core sample to set him experiments to drilling trenches and so forth and I thought okay this scientist has been on the moon - humph he's been he's been breathing too much oxygen there he's not gonna be on anyone's soil we not only did a lot of work on the moon but we had a good time and you know you're only gonna come that way once in your life I just looked around and no one we were leaving no we weren't coming back and yeah I said we now leave as we once came and God willing as we shall return [Music] [Music] when you look back on that now and see how long it's been since we've flown to the moon you realize not only how difficult it was but how unique it was how marvelous it was frankly it's hard for me to believe sometimes that we did it the political achievement not to mention engineered achievement of putting humans on the moon and bring them safely back to earth and improving it won the fluke by doing it six times and all that was fantastic we take for granted today the technology has come from power we live in a different world today because of Apollo [Music] although gene cernan was the 12th and last American to set foot on the moon in 1972 the exploration of space did not end there it simply turned the page in the decade of the 70s NASA's unmanned explorers set out on journeys that would cross millions of miles and show us worlds that until now had only existed as tiny points of light in the night sky [Music] yeah I got right in the beginning of Landsat NASA really really did something unique in that program but people don't really recognize we started the whole digital camera color analysis but it turned out to have this incredible characteristic that it could cover large areas at the same time bring out small deviations in the characteristics of the earth and you're gonna use color to interpret it to therefore calculate what was in the various areas [Music] I was in the desert in Kenya on the Eclipse expedition and we saw the fragments around Skylab go over us and I thought oh brother there's been an accident in the Skylab launch my hopes and desires for science that was gonna come out of science Skylab I thought well it's cooked [Music] 1973 I was commander of the second Skylab mission and Jack Lousma was the best Eevee a guy that I've ever met and I said if we send Jack out there and let him work on that thing he'll find a way lo and behold he goes out there and fools around with it awhile trying to get these connectors undone and finally gets them undone and puts it all together to work great [Music] and he went on to a Brent scientific discovery which had to do with coronal mass ejections and for the first time we were able to see these we're big chunks of the corona and blow off it's day after day of hard work and even though you have a nice view out the window that doesn't kind of pay you back for the constant effort that you have to put out to be productive in space it's a tough job and only dedicated humans can do this sort of thing it operated for about nine months which was much longer than in been anticipated and at that time we understood some things that we'd never understood before and it gave us some forward momentum in the science that continues right now till today [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me call to express my very great admiration for your hard work your total dedication in preparing for this first joint flight today is not far off when eight missions made possible by this first joint effort will be more or less commonplace one of them huge surprises of the mid 20th century came with one of the Mariner spacecraft the Mariner spacecraft started towards Venus and they found that the sun's magnetic field far away from the earth was about as strong as the Earth's magnetic field and I had been taught and everybody else had them but the sun's magnetic field will be negligible and so it presented us was a tremendous confrontation of how could that be so [Music] the one planet that was most intriguing to humans human scientists was Mars mercury was closer but it was very inhospitable Venus was the nearest one to us but it was worried in hospital because the atmosphere was toxic and hot Mars showed seasonal variations that suggested something was alive and I think that was the basis for creating Viking to see if there was life on Mars when we got down and found out how dry and arid and barren the place really was came as a bit of a surprise we had hoped to find microscopic life the thing that happened that kind of left us in a quandary was the three experiments that were directly life detecting did it breathe did it eat did it do photosynthesis all said that something here and when you tried to find the dead bodies you couldn't so that kind of left us in the position why the jury is still out in the end we ended up with two successful Anna's on the service and two very successful orbiters that exceeded their lifetime by many many months so obviously we were all related then or you could say we did it we did it when we flew by Neptune people were standing in line at night at planetariums in order to be able to see the images coming in from Voyager because they weren't on the web in those days there was no web you had to go somewhere in the middle of the night to see it it became a worldwide event when Voyager was flying by these worlds and I had no idea that it would have that kind of an impact and of course that in the in the long run is the most important thing Borges dentists show how much there is the new frontiers of space [Music] the 1970s really saw the start and heavy activity in the project aircraft area which initially focused on sto L aircraft and then moved into the v/stol arena so the rotor craft worked under way very heavily and has continued to today until it is the remaining flight research activity there were about five of us that came into the space system division that had been formed to support shuttle development coming to work was fun to do that kind of thing that was a little bit unique kind of like having some very expensive toys to play with I think that was a magnificent development program you know there were an awful lot of people including some people at Langley that were very hesitant that the couple would be successful would all those thousands of thermal towels underneath protect it would it burn up it turned out to be a tremendous opportunity [Music] six five four main engine start [Music] a vehicle that could launch into space as a rocket put 25 tons of cargo into orbit and land on a runway like an airplane not just once but over and over again in the 1980s NASA would rip this concept from the pages of science fiction and place it squarely on the cutting edge of space travel [Music] [Applause] [Music] going up the launchpad and they're looking up and seeing you know this huge rocket that kind of sounds like an animal you can k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nd of hear the gurgling and the hissing and you know it sounds like it's alive [Music] a few seconds right before liftoff every time I've done this has been a little bit of right about whether I really want to be doing this or not dopamine engine start I was really just focusing right on the tasks at hand and trying not to think about you know the fact that tons and tons and tons of rocket fuel we're about to explode around us liftoff of shuttle Discovery Roger roll discovery [Music] six seconds in this light forces and sensations are just powerful beyond imagination they shake you so much that you can hardly see the displays in front of you right after that solid rocket boosters are jettisoned at two minutes it's a very smooth ride the acceleration is very powerful and you're on the way to orbit with a very different feeling [Music] as soon as you achieved orbit the engines cut off just instantaneously you go from being pressed in the seat to hanging in your straps and sort of floating in the cockpit the fact that I was going to be the first American woman to go into space carried huge expectations along with it and of course it was very important to me that I understood my role really well and that I was really well prepared for the mission because the last thing that I wanted to do was get into space and make a mistake so I wanted to be very very sure that I was able to meet the expectations [Music] but it wasn't from me desire to be the first african-american in space my desire was to make a contribution just to make a contribution and I think I probably told people that I would probably prefer not being in that role versus being in their world because I figured being a number two that would be a lot more fun [Music] [Applause] [Music] it feels like you weigh twice as much as you normally do during the entry portion once you get on final all of the emotions and in focus or just on that last little bit of landing and it's a it's a neat way to end a fight when you actually get to put your hands on the stick and fight yourself engines throttling up three hundred and a hundred and four person [Music] we come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans to share the grief that we all feel and perhaps in that sharing to find the strength to bear our sorrow and the courage to look for the seeds of hope risk is something we have to just really consider as part of our life especially an exploration I know we've had some tragedies and we'll probably have tragedies in the future but you know the ones that we've lost were probably the first ones to tell you keep pressing on don't stop because of us my role as a mechanical engineer was to find out you know what fell apart or what happened and we finally found that the o-ring supposed to be designed so the pressure on one side pushes them more securely into place the the housing for that big old ring was just the opposite the pressure actually pushed it out finally of course when the thing burned through and actually burned the nozzle through it's pretty obvious to see what what the problem so with them we got the job with the redesign [Music] [Applause] two spaces discovery clears the tower Roger roll discovery [Music] good morning discovery you gotta go for HST deploy ops NASA opened the decade of the 90s by placing the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit that would peer farther into space and further back in time than any other telescope and in the closing decade of the 20th century Hubble and a host of other robotic explorers would provide astonishing new views and perspectives everybody was up we were off to discover the secrets of the universe it was it was great and then things started to the east wouldn't scratch your head why is it taking so long why can't we focus the telescope what's going on what was wrong with Hubble is the kind of the same thing that's wrong with your eyes when you need glasses basically the shape of the lens was wrong so in essence the telescope was nearsighted and it needed some glasses I was taking a shower in the hotel in Germany and had these really funny shower heads where the shower head will kind of move up and down and back and forth and that's when it dawned on me we can have this instrument robotically raise up the corrective lens flip out if you will just like that shower head these other corrective optics to correct the aberration for all the instruments all of the work leading up to the first servicing mission is probably the most exciting time of my career [Music] the NASA program changed the nature of astronomy we made some extravagant promises on Hubble we under sold the program whatever we said Hubble did better I think it really changed the nature of what we know the Hubble is one of the most phenomenal things we've ever done in space data that we get from Hubble will continue to change the way we think about ourselves about the universe and our place in it you know the pictures from Hubble are iconic you see them everywhere the fingers of God this is the gas pillars that are actually many many many light-years across so the scale of these things is enormous and you actually seeing the birth of stars this is a star nursery it starts to give you a sense of how small we are and how vast the universe is and that's my favorite picture NASA especially Goddard was the place where I could carry out the dreams that I had which were to push forward an experiment that would measure the Big Bang radiation better than anyone had ever tried before and took on the job of working on Kobe for many many decades people didn't agree with the Big Bang Theory they thought and something else must be true generations of astronomers thought it must have been the steady state Theory Einstein didn't like the idea so when we got the measurements that fit exactly on the theoretical prediction for the Big Bang and this tremendous sigh of relief went through the world as well our measurement of the hot and cold spots in the Big Bang radiation which show us not only is the Big Bang Theory right but also it gives us the map of the seeds of the structure the things that will eventually grow into galaxies [Music] the Galileo probe which sent its spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter was the most demanding entry probe I ever flown by anyone and it worked perfectly [Music] Europa and some of the other satellites where there seems to be accumulating evidence water are getting to be very very interesting places for exploring I mean who knows what's under the ice surface and Europa you've got water looks like there's salt water you wouldn't have water if you didn't have her source of energy the odd coloration gives some hint of the presence of organics when those conditions held on the early Earth life developed in a couple of hundred million years something interesting on Europa way to work nowadays we're discovering what is the universe really like and it's totally magnificent and one can only be inspired and awestruck by what we find so I think a proper response is complete amazement in awe at the universe that we're in and how it works is just far more complicated than humans will ever properly understand we have capture Muir was a successor to the early Salyut Space Station's that the Russians built back in the 70s Wow is extremely fortunate that I was able to be part of the shuttle-mir program obviously there were a lot of challenges when you're trying to work with a different culture I mean it's a challenge for the Russians and it's a challenge for the Americans but everybody wanted to work together to make it come to pass I definitely think it started teaching us the lessons we needed to learn and it was it was key to that very technical things that you know seem simple but become very complicated just by language and wig cultural definitions of things that you know I think our guys did a phenomenal job bringing all those pieces together booster ignition and liftoff of discovery with a crew of six astronauts heroes one American legend [Music] while I was on a discovery in 98 we had 83 different research projects on that one flight now you go up for a couple of weeks say and you find some of the things occurring on the human body that are are much the same as getting old right here on earth the body's immune system changes you get less resistant to disease and infection the body's ability to replace protein and the muscle becomes less and so the question was if could we find by comparing my reaction to the younger people's action reaction to this up there could we maybe get a clue as to what within the body turns a human system on and off with regard to immunity hopefully we can find ways maybe to make it possible for younger astronauts to go on longer missions without having some of the problems they have and at the same time cut out some of the frailties of old age for people here on earth [Music] and ever we've got unity firmly attached [Applause] we [Music] [Music] we have initial contact initial contact of the Soyuz capsule with the expedition 1 crew to the International Space Station the hatch was opened at 1 0 to 1 4 0 Universal Time the first expedition on Space Station requests permission to take the radio car prime our problem we are on a true space ship now making her way above or any earthly boundary that our crews can work together as equals in our countries as partners all the other vehicles we had ever built could be totally assembled put together and tested on the ground before you launch them into space the space station is so large you know it's 360 feet wide doing an 80 feet long 120 feet thick or something like that weighs a million pounds and it takes 46 or 47 assembly flights just to take up all the pieces so every time you brought up a new piece you had a different spacecraft that had a different set of requirements and basically a new spacecraft and at each stage it has to operate completely successfully for an extended period of time even as the international space station was being assembled in orbit Spirit and Opportunity would soon Rove the Martian landscape but early in this new millennium we would endure a tragic reminder of the dangers of space travel and Columbia Houston we see your tire pressure messages and we did not come to your last [Music] at nine o'clock this morning Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our space shuttle Columbia short time later debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas the Columbia is lost there are no survivors NASA is been charged with advancing the technology and understanding of space flight for this country which means we're on the cutting edge of what can be done then we're going to be taking risk and spaceflight is one of the areas where we face risk on a daily basis and in the process of doing this we develop the new technologies new techniques the new inventions we make discovery this is what's going to keep us powerful and safe and secure and assure the economic vitality of our nation [Music] we actually put our many years of hypersonic research here at Langley into into work into a vehicle that actually flew with the HyperX program which was indeed an exciting exciting program this was put on a Pegasus booster taken up to test point and then released three two one launch launch sequences reset the x43 would acknowledge him we had two vehicles Mach 7 and then we had a mock Terry because we broke our own record the Mach 7 was the first record breaker and then we broke our own record with the Mach 10 as far as speed [Music] I had a great time working on airplanes and fighters and stuff [Music] the agency not only built and flew some very cool things we also had a lot of research that then got on to other airplanes we did a lot of work at that you know ultimately led to things that are on the f-22 and f-117 and maybe on the Joint Strike Fighter we don't build 747s and we don't build f-22 but we certainly did things that helped the companies that do build those kind of flight vehicles make their airplanes better three main engine start the reason we send unmanned spacecraft is to pave the way for humans the reason we've got spirit and opportunity on Mars is to tell us a little bit about what it's going to be like the things we're going to encounter when we get there because it's man's intellect its man's intelligence that she can never recreate this computer we intentionally made them so human we gave them 20/20 vision we gave them the ability to move around in an environment we gave them an arm so that they could reach out and touch things and then we used them to do exactly what we would do if we were there one thing that NASA gives us is is a very different perspective on the whole universe including our own world our own worlds place in it when we look at other worlds and we look through the eyes of a robot at a frozen desert we appreciate our own world so much more because we see what it could be like when they die it will be sad but they will have led such long and productive lives and will have died honorable deaths that I'll be at peace with it because of what they've done these are machines after all but you feel an emotional attachment put so much of ourselves into these things that when we lose them we'll lose a part of ourselves it'll be hard I really miss three engines up and burning three two one and liftoff of space shuttle Discovery beginning America's new journey to and beyond when you approach the space station it actually felt like it was enveloping you as you got closer because the size of it was so immense you could hardly take it in and all the windows or your peripheral vision and it seemed like it you were flying into a canyon like in Star Wars almost in it it totally surrounded you but it's a wonderful feeling to to see the space station coming up and it's being framed by the the earth below very beautiful views trying to distract you from your task of flying the space shuttle when you arrive on the International Space Station you know there's a little bit of a shock factor it was very odd when they closed the hatch and we weren't on that shuttle you saw them flying away and it was like wow we're really here man this is gonna be a long visit we get scheduled for approximately two hours of exercise a day and that's to try and counteract some of the negative effects of being in zero gravity on the musculoskeletal system and our cardiovascular system so that was an important aspect of every day that we're onboard in the station the crew members themselves are laboratory rats as if you will you know because we have a human research program trying to understand what happens to people when they're in space for long periods of time and so we participate in those experiments obviously I also think the space station offers an incredible laboratory we've added additional laboratory modules during expedition 16 and with their most recent addition on the last shuttle flight so it's gonna be I think a spectacular laboratory as well and I'm excited about what the future holds for us they're probably the biggest legacy of the International Space Station I think will be the International aspect the fact that we're doing this internationally and it's a huge technical accomplishment but I think the fact that we are overcoming these cultural obstacles and bringing these people together with this common goal I think is one of the most significant aspects of the International Space Station I believe that human beings should expand into space by doing that we can learn about ourselves and make the society and the world better by working together in a cooperative way we can bring the world closer together this is a great opportunity for Japan and other countries to be able to participate in a space program like the ISS NASA Labs are the pride of the world for things that we can do where science and engineers meet together and say let's do the impossible and and we'll do it our space projects are very demanding person has to work maybe night and day and weekends so when the schedule requires it to finish something on time [Music] we feel I feel that the entire world is watching us and waiting for us to do our thing and to get it right and it's a tremendous opportunity it's also tremendous responsibility and it's always been pretty clear that we do this together as teams and that it's the only way you could possibly do these amazing projects so I think we can be very proud of what we've accomplished we look back in history and when we think this country was founded in part by a scientist Ben Franklin and a future president on Thomas Jefferson who was very fond of science and so that would be so proud and thrilled to see what our country has accomplished with science and and the engineering miracles that have happened in consequence I think they never would have guessed but they would still be thrilled to see what's been done as NASA enters its sixth decade it's time to go back to the moon this time we'll go back not just for a few hours not for a few days but for good for the good of exploration innovation and inspiration for the good of humanity we will give NASA a new focus and vision for future exploration to gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own [Music] we as a civilization must explore that's who we are intrinsically to the human races were explorers and unless we continue to explore we're going to falter as a civilization [Music] when we cease to be an explanation when we cease to seek knowledge and as questions that's the time we will wither and die on his plan I think it's significantly important that we look to the future Mars of course will be the next outpost I think will have people living on Mars 50 years from now what they'll be looking forward to I have no idea but I'm sure it'll be fascinating I'd like to see the mission to Mars they accomplished something I did some work on and making the proposal we made I think there's a consensus that going to Mars is a worthy objective and I'd like to see that accomplished perhaps at one time in the distant past the at least some basic life forms existed on Mars and perhaps could again in the future these things mean a lot to me I think space is important and I think America should continue to be in the forefront of space exploration no matter where you go in the world people know what the letters in a essay stand for they say NASA and they say it was recognition that in and of itself tells you that NASA stands for something in the world not just in America but across the world throughout all human history we've we've always had people look up and think you know the blue sky what is it up there do you what it would be like if we could go up there in our time our lifetimes we've gone up there you know here we are and develop that kind of a capability in our time what a great time to be alive the future mankind depends upon space travel if we stand earth will go on and having wars but if we go to the Moon and Mars will bind ourselves together into one single race one color and going to space and live forever [Music] [Applause] remember [Music] [Music] [Music] remember [Music] you

it's a region of ice worlds some solitary some with moons their names may be unfamiliar Eris Makemake how mayor but they hold clues to all our origins and the first of these worlds and the one we'll reach in 2015 is the king of the Kuiper belt Pluto the long journey of NASA's new Horizons mission began in 2006 aboard America's biggest baddest rocket tricked out with every conceivable booster we built a very light spacecraft and bought a very large launch vehicle and the combination is ferocious but in some sense it all began in 1930 with Clyde Tombaugh 24 years old and fresh off a farm in Kansas but willing to spend long hours scanning star fields to find a moving point of light humanity's first glimpse of cool the dream of actually getting the Pluto began with a six-year-old boy in love with science who grew up to lead a team of brilliant researchers and engineers with dogged persistence through decades of planning and building and testing a race against time just to get to the launcher exploring the outer solar system because it's so far takes a lot of time it requires a lot of patience a lot of dedication a lot of perseverance but it's the frontier assuming all goes well at Pluto NASA may choose to extend the adventure further out into the Kuiper belt the solar system's mysterious third zone this is maybe the one chance in my lifetime that we're going to get a spacecraft out of there and look up close at one of these Kuiper belt objects December 6th 2014 New Horizons wakes up for the last time from hibernation New Horizons is speeding towards Pluto and a phenomenal rate and we can't wait for it to get there January 27 2015 6 months of approach science begins July 14th 2015 New Horizons long journey 3 billion miles million years in flight and 85 years of speculation about Pluto climaxes in one day of close approaching flyby you know we're round at third base and we're headed up the dream the adventure the promise of discovery that's what makes 2015 the year of Pluto [Music] studying Pluto and its neighbors from Earth is one of the toughest challenges in astronomy it takes the largest telescopes and most advanced instrumentation on the planet and it's tough even for the Hubble Space Telescope and it takes time from the discovery of Pluto in 1930 to NASA approving the New Horizons mission in 2001 to arriving of the planet in 2015 it's been 85 years and time passing is definitely an actor in our story but it's the combination of human skill cutting-edge image processing and sheer bloody-minded persistence that has resulted in the most important discoveries and that's a tale is true today is back in 1913 when Pluto was first found by Clyde Tombaugh in 2011 at the SETI Institute near San Francisco mark Showalter used Hubble data to discover two new moons around Pluto although he was actually looking for possible rings Showalter has found rings associated with small moons around other planets and that was kind of the motivation for checking out Pluto it's got two little satellites satellite threes clouds of dust let's see what might be there it's easy to take artistic license to show what Pluto's rings might look like in reality it's incredibly hard to see faint objects against the dense background star field and a glare from Pluto and its large moon Charon we came up with this trick where you take the images and then you rotate the camera 90 degrees you take more images and if you do that all just right you can do this thing where all that glare cancels out and what we're left with is just the Rings we could think of it as a stack of images think of it as like a cube looking down so let's uh let's turn it on its side so now if we start peeling off the layers and looking downward through the stack things suddenly become much much cleaner for example Hydra and Nix show up very very cleanly but the thing that immediately caught my eye was this little dot right there it's not a perfectly sharp lot pixel like over here and that's what made it pretty convincing to me that we had seen a very small moon of Pluto that nobody had seen before to be sure you've detected a real moon or planet you'd have to show it's moving unlike the background stars the thing that makes moons distinctive is if come back later they'd all have shifted because they all orbit the central planet this required a great deal of patience to then wait about six days until we got our next set of observations of the Pluto system sure enough the object was still there it had moved by just about the right amount to be something orbiting Pluto and we knew we had to move next year Showalter and colleagues went back and built on lessons learned to see what else might be there summer 2012 now mark had 15 more days of Hubble observations now what you can see here are three time steps each of those time steps is actually about 45 minutes of data that means it's long enough that the little moons moved it's moving back and forth in the three frame sequence Hydra is moving Nix is moving I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to say that that looks like a little moon of Pluto it's moving just the way the others are they're all going around the planet in the same direction and so it was just a couple of weeks later that we made the announcement that the fifth moon had been discovered patience persistence ingenuity that was exactly what led to the discovery of Pluto back in 1930 in Kansas in the 1920s Clyde Tombaugh grew up in hard times and built telescopes using leftover farm implements the check the accuracy of his best telescope he sent drawings of Mars and Jupiter to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff Arizona they were looking for staff and he was hired along with observing the Stars he stoped the furnace and shoveled snow but one assignment made history day after day he'd used this machine known as a blink comparator to look for anything in his images that moved it was tedious painstaking work but on plates taken on January 23rd and 29th and analyzed in February he saw a small dot that did move against the fixed stars announcing the results after careful confirmation the Observatory made it easy to find the new planet by heading arrows this is an incredible work of observational astronomy and having done something similar but with much more powerful tools I can really appreciate his achievement for decades Pluto remained more or less a point of light but in the mid 70s Dale Cruikshank and colleagues attached cameras with infrared filters to a telescope at Kitt Peak detectors or sensors had been improved and larger telescopes had become available but we did that work in 1976 and found evidence and service it was several years later that we found evidence for the other ices in 1978 astronomers Jim Christie and Bob Harrington analyzed new plates taken at the US Naval Observatory in Flagstaff Christie noted an elongation to the north of Pluto one month later the bump had disappeared from this and other evidence they concluded that Pluto like earth had a moon Charon from eclipses between Pluto and Charon occurring in the 1980s astronomers calculated that the moon was almost half the size of its parent body so large that both objects spin around their mutual center of gravity outside Pluto Pluto and Charon were the first double dwarf planet combo discovered in our solar system using the basic physics of their orbits and the distance between them astronomers could calculate their mass and size Pluto was a little smaller than Earth's moon about 1,500 miles in diameter and had only 1/10 that's mass between 1985 and 1990 astronomers were in luck as Pluto and Charon orbited their mutual center of gravity each past in turn in front of the other the so called mutual events allowed astronomers like Mark Bowie to capture the changing patterns of light patiently Bowie created a map of Pluto Pluto turned out to have one of the two most contrasty surfaces in the entire solar system in the mid-90s Bowie and Allen Stern used the Hubble Space Telescope to make the first direct images of Pluto's surface and it's exciting to mark an eye and to our whole scientific team to be able to see this object that no humans really could glimpse as a real planet has a real object in the solar system previously in 2005 Hal Weaver and Allen Stern used the Hubble for another close-up look at Pluto and Charon they discovered two small dim moons where only Karen had been seen before now we know from mark Showalter --zz worked that there are two more moons making the current total of five and that Pluto is a genuine mini planetary system from its size and orbit astronomers estimated that Pluto is perhaps 70% rock and 30 percent ice that makes it one of the largest of a whole new class of objects the ice dwarf planets making up what's known as the Kuiper belt this region is named for Gerard Kuiper a leading mid 20th century planetary astronomer Kuiper suggested that the solar system didn't end with Neptune and Pluto but that there should be a disk of other worlds beyond them in 1992 from a mountaintop in Hawaii David Jewett and Jane Lew found the first Kuiper belt object they were using new and highly sensitive C CDs like the sensors in a modern-day camera but their technique was essentially an updated version of Tom Boss work take carefully registered images of a patch of sky and see if anything moves against the distant stars this one qb1 did just that it was only a few hundred kilometers across ten times smaller than Pluto but still huge compared to a comet since then teams of astronomers have found around 2000 KBO's informed by cutting-edge astronomy but with a fair dose of artistic license let's take a trip through this third zone of our solar system we used to think of the solar system of consisting of two different types of planets the planets we call the terrestrial planets which are earth-like planets that would be Mercury Venus Earth and Mars next out the asteroid belt fragments of worlds smashed to pieces by gravitation and collisions then come the four gas giants Jupiter and its moons Saturn with its magnificent rings Uranus also ringed and Neptune and then Pluto was this kind of you know odd guy out it was this little object at the edge of the solar system and then when we found all these other quite rebelde objects this is kind of almost a third type of object so for the first time ever you will be able to fly by a brand new object an object that's been forming for billions of years and understand what outer parts of the solar system are all about by July 2015 we'll know for sure what Pluto and its moons look like and that will provide breakthrough information on all those other ice Dwarfs planets the most numerous planetary objects in the entire solar system that make up the Kuiper belt actually the Kuiper belt is more like a donut bulging up above and down below the ecliptic where most of the planets move it's kind of like the asteroid belt but much bigger it has hundreds of times more objects in it than the asteroid belt let's now visit five named KBO's in the exact positions they'll be in on July 14 2015 the day when New Horizons flies by Pluto wha-wha was one of the first Kuiper belt objects discovered it's about 1,000 kilometres in diameter a reddish world covered in water ice methane and ethane and like many KBO's it has a tiny moon of its own way what up above and down below the plane of the solar system numerous KBO's have been flung about by Neptune's gravity this region is known as the scattered disc one of the largest of these KBO's Eris is close in size to Pluto and is made of rock and methane ice astronomers categorize KBO's by the tilt of their orbits relative to the plane of the solar system and one of the more highly inclined orbits belongs to Makemake named for a Hawaiian creation deity some of these have methane or water ice on their surfaces some of them just seem to be covered in some brownish gunk there are gray objects out there there are brown objects out there there seem to be distinct populations some of them seem to be very spherical and so they probably have warm interiors and then others are peculiar shapes which suggests they're very cold and strong perhaps the most bizarre and unexpected KBO is how maiya a KBO shaped like an American football made of rock and ice it's white with red splotches and orbited by at least two moons one of the strangest orbits of any KBO belongs to Sedna discovered in 2003 its orbit is the most eccentric of any KBO now known bringing it as close as 76 au to the Sun but then carrying it outward - 936 times the earth-sun distance said in a strange 11,000 year orbit seems to link it to an even vaster cloud of objects ready for exploration by future generations the organ cloud is an immense icebox of long period comets from 10 to 100 times more distant than the Kuiper belt surrounding all the worlds of our solar system there's a real record of the only history of the solar system out there in cold storage at the edge of the solar system this is what was left over and Pluto is the first member of that group but to begin humanity's exploration of the Kuiper belt you first have to get to Pluto and that means getting a mission approved a spacecraft designed and built and delivered to the launch pad on time and none of that was easy [Music] 2015 may be the year of Pluto but getting there has taken many long years of effort and for New Horizons there's a date when things got started 1989 it was the year when George Herbert Walker Bush became president and the Berlin Wall fell far from Earth it was also the year when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by Neptune and returned the first images of its moon Triton hairstyles of some New Horizons scientists were very different but for them may 5th 1989 was a most important date that's the day that I marched into the then division director for planetary science at NASA headquarters Jeff Briggs as a graduate student and asked him why we are studying the mission to Pluto and he responded because no one's ever asked me before that seems like a brilliant idea why don't we do that space missions rely on hundreds if not thousands of people but sometimes it takes someone with passion and persistence to make things happen and for New Horizons that's Allen Stern I was interested in this when I was a boy so I've been somewhere between in the groove and stuck in a rut for 40 years there had been some thought about sending one of the tween Voyager spacecraft past Pluto to complete the exploration of the known solar system but in the 70s the scientific establishment wasn't convinced Pluto was all that interesting young grad students i Kalyn mark and frame bag and all thought differently I came all about late 1989 or so there was a bunch of us who were really keen to go to Pluto and the thing that drew me to it the most was the fact that we knew so little here's the frontier so it was a bit of an opportunity for young people to come in and say hey what are we gonna go next what's the next great frontier that we should go explore and it was clear out so they kind of Allen Pham mark and a small band of enthusiasts became known as the pedo underground so we realized to make this happen we had to get together and campaign hard to make the case to go there and explore this little planet with all its moons all through the 90s there were many competing plans for a Pluto mission like the Pluto fast flyby the Pluto Kuiper express a Pluto mission was on then off then on then off we put a mission a bit a cat it would have been dead long ago because they only get nine lives and we've had significantly more than nine stoppages and odd twists and turns what finally turned the tide was the National Academies decay --dl survey a consensus document from leading planetary scientists that ranked a Kuiper belt Pluto mission highest and priority for medium-class budgets finally after competitive proposals were evaluated new horizons which teamed Allen Stern with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory APL and several other institutions across the country was selected by NASA on November 29th 2001 now plans on paper became metal in clean rooms in 2004 lead scientist Alan Stern described the missions key science objective you know the planetary science is that you really have to go places to get the resolution to get up close enough to really see what's going on we want to get up close and personal the very best resolution of current telescopes looking at Pluto would give this kind of fuzzy image of a much more familiar world but here's what New Horizons would see if flying over New York City lakes in Central Park wharves on the Hudson River you know reisen's is the first really of a whole new breed of spacecraft that is focusing on a very specific task for this first mission to Pluto the questions are basic what do Pluto and Charon look like what are they made of how do their atmospheres behave we have to really be disciplined and say we can't do everything let's focus on the primary questions and design the instruments to answer those primary questions the long-range imager glory will be used for navigation approaching Pluto and close-up views during the flyby the wide-angle camera Ralph has both visible light and infrared sensors to map Pluto and Charon and characterize their icy surfaces there are two fields and particles detectors to probe the solar wind at Pluto the large radio antenna is an essential communications device but both Rex and Alice and ultraviolet imaging spectrometer are part of experiments to analyze Pluto's atmosphere and there's the Venetia Burney student dust counter built by undergrads at UC Boulder and honoring the school girl who named Pluto back in 1930 together the seven science instruments comprise the most powerful set of detectors ever sent on a first flyby of any world in our solar system but they're innovative and highly miniaturized design means that even when all are operating they'd draw less power than half a 60 watt bulb and they're intended to work together seamlessly after building comes testing but always with an eye on the clock and the calendar it's very very important that we launch in either 2006 or 2007 we have to make that deadline if you want to fly its Pluto or the quickest route you need Jupiter in position and that means we have to launch in January of 2006 it feels a little bit like being strapped to a train going 500 miles an hour the test program involves teams of engineers at Johns Hopkins APL and then at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center once we launch this we can't go after with a screwdriver we can't go fix anything that isn't working we make sure that we carry plenty of spare equipment on board the spacecraft our main computer breaks we have a backup if our main transmitter breaks we have a backup one of the things we do is we put the whole spacecraft on a gigantic vibration cable a paint shaker and shake it and then test it after that and shake it again and test it again so that's what we're doing from now until launch along with testing the spacecraft New Horizons needs to train and test its human operators and for a mission plan to reach Pluto in 2015 it's important to have young people so they'll be around a close approach it's good that we can do that so they will have both the time the focus to stay with the mission over this long period of time many of the faces you see around Mission Control in 2004 and 2005 are young and enthusiastic spacecraft engineers normally we're focused on subsystems and instruments in the spacecraft surviving that duration but you know for people we have to have a longevity plan they'd be committing the prime of their careers to this mission to Pluto knowing they'd be a decade older when New Horizons reaches its primary target the ability to practice things in those years far out they're all part of the planning now to assure mission success then we're in my 40s throwing your youngster this in late 2005 the action shifts to Cape Canaveral New Horizons may be light and relatively small but launching it to Pluto requires America's most powerful rocket the Atlas 5 New Horizons will be traveling so far from the Sun that solar panels wouldn't be sufficient so the Department of Energy delivered an RTG that would power the Pluto mission by turning heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium into electricity working round the clock they arrived at pad 41 before dawn on behalf of NASA and the entire New Horizons team stern wanted to be the last to bid the spacecraft bon voyage before closing up the hatch on January 19 2006 after 17 years of planning building and testing a picture-perfect launch that thrilled onlookers in Florida and the Mission Operations team back at Johns Hopkins in Maryland and space and then vo despite immense technical and timetable challenges the mission had made its window and was on its way New Horizons velocity at launch was the fastest ever traveling almost 60 times faster than a jetliner in just nine hours it passed the orbit of the moon Apollo had taken almost ten times that long one year later a slingshot gravity assist from the giant planet Jupiter provided another 2 km/s boost cutting travel time the Pluto by three full years but this was more than just a jump in speed the Jupiter flyby was a scientific dress rehearsal for Pluto New Horizons instruments returned detailed images of Jupiter's clouds moons then it was off across the empty ocean of space with no new land in sight till Pluto in 2015 the spacecraft had been tested and passed with flying colors now it was time the test of the humans and the ground systems July 5th 2013 it's day one of an awning day encounter rehearsal the main success criteria for this rehearsal is for the spacecraft to flawlessly perform its activities as if it were included with everything the same accepted food as none the dates in 2013 were carefully chosen so that earth received times would be identical to those for the real encounter in 2015 mission managers wanted scientists and engineers to experience the stress of time critical 24/7 operations expected for July 2015 we're flying by an object there's a huge distance from Earth and we're trying to hit a box it's a hundred five hundred and fifty kilometers wide and that then leads into manoeuvre planning and and trajectory control needed to thread that that needle and hit that small box its way the heck out there this rehearsal would actually be uploading commands to New Horizons to instruct the spacecraft to run through the exact same set of observations as in 2015 there definitely is an element of risk involved but from one standpoint if you didn't do any simulation with the real spacecraft at all you could argue that could pose more risk because you don't want such a critical activity only being done once on flight those are all invaluable to get us ready and and practiced for the one and only shot we'll have to explore the Pluto system we've been waiting at twelve years since your other proposals to do this rehearsal it's a big step before we can do the encounter we think that we are about ten million miles out from - though enclosing that's so far so good officer races [Music] today is our 2720 fourth day in flight this has been a long time coming literally I only want to say thanks for all over let them eat cake July 12th 2013 standing in for July 14th 2015 this is it a minute-by-minute simulation of encounter day it's make-or-break well it's it's the most important because we've best been spending the 24 hours of the most intense activities that we've been running on the spacecraft and this is the longest that we've been out of contact since we've entered encounter rehearsal this may be a rehearsal but New Horizons has been firing its thrusters and spinning in space identical maneuvers to those planned for 2015 on encounter day the spacecraft will be too busy taking data to send back images that's why its first simple I'm alive message will be so important in the next minute ESS 43 should lock up on the signal we're good we're not like all the observations that we planned between the last track in this track it happens this gives us good confidence that at least the spacecraft has been performing all of those twists and turns that we've been in anticipating it - over the last seven days I like to say that at the flyby I don't want to be learning anything about the ground system or the spacecraft of the team I want to be learning only about the Pluto system no spacecraft has ever been to Pluto or nor will ever go back in our lifetime Pluto is every child's favorite planet you know you ask anyone under the age of six they're gonna say Pluto we don't exactly know what food it looks like but it looks very exciting from the images we have from the Hubble Space Telescope so far we really can't wait to get there and see what it actually looks like so if anybody says that food oh is boring or not important no wait before New Horizons arrives at Pluto most everything we think we know about the planet and its moons is up for grabs virtually every place we've sent a spacecraft on a first reconnaissance mission like this that we find out that our earth-based notions were flat wrong so I'll tell you what we expect but I before anything what we expect is to be surprised from the 1990s through today Stern has been consistent in avoiding speculation you get the same answer everybody's gotten from me for almost 20 years I don't make predictions except for one my best guess is we're gonna find something wonderful but in the final months leading up to the July 2015 encounter it's hard for most humans not to imagine what we'll see many planetary scientists like Paul shank based their expectations and what we saw when Voyager 2 reached Neptune and specifically as it flew by its moon Triton Voyager was it you're long expert in the outer solar system and every time they got to a planet it was basically the first time anybody had really seen those bodies so when they got to Jupiter they were greeted with enormous surprises the repeting volcanoes on Io were just completely unexpected and some when I got to Uranus there were more surprises the exotic trains of miranda and ariel for example were not expected so by the time I got to Neptune they were kind of accustomed to the idea that they were going to be surprised and sure enough Triton completely blew them away Bonnie Buratti was at NASA's Jet Propulsion lab as the first images of Triton a moon of nearly 1,700 miles diameter came down right it was almost a twin of fluids about the same size about the same brightness originally Triton was probably a kind of elf object just like Pluto floating around in space but then it got too close to Neptune and got captured by Neptune's gravitational field recently Paul shank enhanced the original Voyager data to create this detailed flyover of Triton it has odd patches and blob-like features like amoebas crawling around on the surface Triton has very few impact craters its surface is extremely young geologically and it actually has guys' bursting material off into space here is a body that is hundreds of degrees below zero so cold it's forlorn it's barren we just didn't expect to see this activity I'm trying it was quite a surprise if you just assume that Pluto was going to look exactly like Triton which is the most similar object we know about and you might expect to find a very interesting body but Triton is not the only dynamic ice world in the outer solar system sixteen years later the Cassini spacecraft sent back images of Saturn's moon Enceladus about three hundred miles across this is a tiny little and in Seles is actually a winter wonderland it's very bright it reflects almost all the radiation that falls on it and it has these huge ice volcanoes spewing out from its South Pole and Enceladus is continuously giving off puffs at water vapor and so if you start to see puffs of water vapor coming off Pluto as New Horizons gets closer that would be exceedingly interesting but what forces can power volcanoes in the Deep Freeze of the outer solar system Triton and Pluto are both balls of ice with presumably rock in the center and so one of the sources of energy is radioactive decay inside the rock which gives off heat just like the earth is heated if you just let Pluto sit there and pump the heat out of the rocks you generate enough energy to melt a couple of hundred commoners worth of ice it's still possible to have an ocean beneath the relatively thick ice shell the ice shell might be 100 miles there's also over billions of years the ice shell gets thicker and thicker and thicker as Bluto cools and as it does so it squeezes the water underneath and if you squeeze the water to merge and it may well actually create fractures and the water could jet onto the surface when you're going out to the edge of the solar system you kind of have to expect some surprises and then grass see them at Pluto's just as tradin and Enceladus were mere dots before spacecraft reached them until now Pluto has been an astronomers planet that's about the change we going to start off as astronomers and we'll be using astronomical tools to try and sharpen up our images and pull every last little bit of detail out of these fuzzy blobs we gradually turned from astronomers into geologists as we get closer and it becomes a real-world Jeff Moore was in the room at JPL as those Trident images came down but he also enjoys fieldwork and thinks will recognize some similar planetary processes at work on Pluto is back on earth so I'm a geologist and although we don't expect to see oceans on Pluto there are common processes which operate on this planet which are likely to operate also on Pluto and its moons while the scales are very different erosion shapes landforms here on earth and all across the solar system there are these little finger-like projections that are formed by the process of erosion where wind and water have sculpted this landscape by taking advantage of small differences in the strength of the original rock creating large huge fantastic landscapes such as on Jupiter's moon Callisto and we can anticipate that we may perhaps also see landscapes like this on Pluto and its moons Pluto's 248 year orbit is more eccentric than our solar system's terrestrial and gas giant planets greatly varying its distance to the Sun but it's typical of many other objects in the Kuiper belt and newly discovered planets around other stars that plus it's highly angled polar tilt combined to produce strong seasonal effects in fact the seasons of Pluto are amongst the most extreme of any seasons of any world that we know of orbiting the Sun and those extremes may be one reason why its surface is also extremely Pluto has props the most intensely bright and dark place that we've seen in the solar system this dark surface collects more heat it warms up like asphalt does on a sunny day here on the earth and if their word frost had settled on this dark surface they're being heated up and driven off and the transportation of this material could also be creating winds so you might see small dunes oriented along the periphery of the dark surface showing this process in action for planetary scientists color can be a clue to the composition of surfaces that can't be sampled directly on the earth these kinds of colors from red to dark gray are generated entirely by the presence or absence of rust on Pluto we see also the same ranges of colors from grey to bright white to yellow to red to black but they're MSP due to a completely different process at NASA's Ames Research Center near San Francisco long time Pluto researcher Dale Cruikshank and postdoc Chris matarese conduct experiments to see what processes might create the colors we see on Pluto starting with gases like methane and nitrogen and the extreme low temperatures we know are found there in our cold chamber we can produce a thin film of ice and then after that expose them to a beam of electrons which are charged particles comparable to what comes in to Pluto's surface from space we find that when we shine ultraviolet light or electrons on simple molecules before too long the simple molecules are broken apart and by natural processes they reassemble into more complex chemicals so far the colors we make in the lab from radiating these ices is is fairly close to what we see on Pluto there are tones of yellow light brown up through fairly dark red and if we carry the processing by ultraviolet light to an extreme degree",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that material actually turns black and this is almost the color of a pure carbon seeing how radiation transforms simple ices into complex and colorful organic molecules should help interpret the close-up views of Pluto's surface that will be sent back by New Horizons color translates to the duration of the exposure of these of the otherwise colorless ices over a year ten thousand years ten million years that may in turn tell us more about the nature of the exposure of Pluto's surface and even the age of who those surface Dale Cruikshank began observing Pluto back in 1976 now 39 years later he's ready for its close-up we can say that Pluto is chemically active chemically dynamic we don't know yet if it's geologically active dynamic but that's what New Horizons is going to tell us we've been surprised in that way before as we've passed other planetary bodies that we had thought were totally cold dead inert worlds and find that there are geysers there are ice floes there are cracks and all kinds of evidence for geological activity I can still remember the first time I saw Prudhoe in a telescope and it was just a little dot that you can barely see it will be amazing that within a period of hours you will be transformed from this tiny dot that I studied as an astronomer to this huge geologic world that will be able to see volcanoes and faults and Isis and mountains and craters I mean it will be truly an amazing experiences here transformed so from sophisticated lab experiments from exploring other worlds and from applying insights from terrestrial processes what should we expect when we get to Pluto in July 2015 but the only thing that was surprised me would be if we turned out not to be surprised but enjoying the scientific surprises to come means avoiding dangers on the last few million miles to pee though that's next December 6 2014 in Mission Control Alice Bowman and her team wait to get confirmation that New Horizons has exited what's called hibernation for 2/3 of its 3 billion mile journey most spacecraft systems have been turned off saving wear and tear on the science instruments New Horizons sends a simple signal once a week just to say I'm still a ok Alice's team has a unique way of showing spacecraft status when New Horizons is hibernating their bear mascot is safely asleep when the spacecraft wakes up they put on its party hat if all goes well this will be the 18th time spacecraft and bear have woken up but December 2014 is different VIPs from NASA are on hand to film crews document the action as Alan explains the benefits of hibernation it lowers our cost because we don't need to have people babysitting the spacecraft 24/7 outside interest in New Horizons is building if all goes well New Horizons will stay awake flying by Pluto in July 2015 and then returning data until October 2016 tonight data trickles in and Alice has to wait to be certain New Horizons is fully awake we should be getting it momentarily it should be any minute now it's like watching paint dry I figure if I stare at the screen pardon that packet five just came in every go long my sitter one we have a nominal wake up of the New Horizons spacecraft on its way we're ready for an excellent [Music] it's gonna be here for a while this is a watershed day we have completed the crews across three billion miles of space the spacecraft is now awake finally after nine years glad to see hibernation behind us an active ops ahead onto Pluto but there are still hundreds of tasks to ensure a safe flyby in July 2015 January 27th New Horizons has been sending back technical data and all seems fine but today is the first time Hal Weaver and Andy Cheng will be seeing new science images lead scientist for the Lorri camera Laurie is used for navigation to find the targets and to correct the trajectory so we get to the right place at the right time well there's currents temperatures all look normal no error messages this is it let's check out the very first images and then Sharon for project scientist Hal Weaver even the jump in size from one the two pixels was significant this is a real milestone in the New Horizons mission the very first images of Pluto in the Pluto encounter year hadn't turned glory on hadn't gotten any images since last summer last July but this is it this is the start of it mama she blows we really don't know what we're going to see that's what this mission is all about what is the surface of Pluto really like how big is it one of the orbits really it's nothing but delightful surprises coming for us but some of the surprises may not be quite so welcome as New Horizons gets still closer to the Pluto system Laurie will be able to identify small moons and possible rings that can't be seen from Earth John Spencer is leading the you halves campaign you has stands for unknown hazards we found new moons or even rings around Pluto and if we see anything like that we're going to want to determine whether it pauses a threat to the spacecraft because if it does if there's debris that we might run into that might damage will kill the spacecraft then we want to evaluate that hazard and determine whether we should take any of a civ action to find out just how vulnerable New Horizons might be - even tiny dust particles the mission sent samples of spacecraft components to the white sands test range technicians at white sands set up gun tests to assess how vulnerable New Horizons outer covers and cables might be we went to two facilities that could shoot things in two parts models of the spacecraft while the results might look dangerous the mission has options to take evasive action one of the backup strategies we have if we feel we need to give the spacecraft extra protection is that we are int it so that the high-gain antenna here which is literally pretty bulletproof and can protect the spacecraft is going to be facing forward in the RAM direction and this is RAM in the sense of battering ram it's a direction in which stuff will be coming at us and ramming into the spacecraft and if that is facing forward then any dust particles that hit the spacecraft are most likely to hit that antenna where they won't cause us problems and only a small part of the spacecraft around the edges is going to be exposed to those particles that would protect the guts of the spacecraft but limit the pointing of the cameras the cameras are fixed in the spacecraft so the spacecraft's has to fight point in one direction the cameras can only point in a limited range of directions this limits the amount of times we can photograph the system as we go past because we can only photograph objects when they're just in the right angle that we can look at them while protecting the spacecraft with the main antenna another option is to take different trajectories through the Pluto system that's called the Shabbat playing Shabbat is the best acronym in the space business it stands for safe haven by other trajectory and it is is the word we use to represent our backup plans at Pluto the second Shabbat takes us much closer to Pluto into the region where atmospheric drag depletes orbits of any debris which we think would be the safest Hail Mary pass that we could fly if we have to do something different than the nominal we are coming into the polluted system with the ability if we learn something we don't expect to be able to make a change and and get the goods but those decisions can only be made in the last month before closest approach and there will be limited time to evaluate the best options so in February 2015 Spenser's U has team including ring specialist mark Showalter and postdocs Simon Porter are running through a readiness test now they're on the clock and being scored for whether they can work through the calculations fast enough to decide on a trajectory correction maneuver that might prevent loss of mission and that makes this exercise more critical than any that have gone before the difference between this and previous operational readiness tests is that this is where we have to demonstrate to the project and NASA that we can do this but the only test the really matters comes on July 14th 2015 that one day will pay off 26 years of dreams and nine years in flight you [Music] for the science team the year of Pluto began with another meeting to review the latest data on the Pluto system and to hear updates on how the spacecraft was performing mission manager Glenn fountain who'd been with the project from its start summarized remaining risks red boxes are possibilities that could kill the mission but now in 2015 there are more and more green boxes risks that have been minimized something that we haven't thought of still might happen but I'm confident that whatever happens whatever fate throws at us this team will be able to resolve it and we'll go on to get wonderful data when we get to Pluto yeah fantastically talented team of people who have worked very hard and we've tested the sequences inside and out and while there are always unknown unknowns I'm very confident and really looking forward to the curtain rising along with mind-bending technical details there also was a sense of history in the making to document the long years of effort to get this close to Pluto the mission recreated a team photograph taken in 2004 as Glen Allen and Alice had carefully planned back then many of the scientists and engineers were still actively engaged in New Horizons and looking forward to July 2015 we worked hard to get a coherent team because if you don't have a good team to operate the spacecraft to do the planning you will fail and so we worked a plan early in the mission to have younger people with the right amount of experience to be on the mission and it's just like watching your kids grow it's like all of a sudden but it's a time go you know they are they're more mature and they're now the very experienced veterans but the hard work of mission planning was by no means over even this close to encounter day while exploring Pluto in 2015 as exciting in itself New Horizons was recommended in part as a mission that might continue on farther out into the Kuiper belt that takes identifying potential targets now for a still more distant flyby should NASA approve an extended mission this challenging task was assigned to John Spencer mark Bowie and a team of young postdocs and like everything else about this mission it wasn't easy Louie and John Spencer had been using earth's largest telescopes in Hawaii and Chile but even Earth's best couldn't crack this task but the basic problem is the Earth's atmosphere is just a mess of these scales there's a limit and that's what we've been beating our heads against now as time running out we had to turn the Hubble and so it sort of not sort of jokingly talk about Hubble to the rescue without Hubble we would not have these objects Marc and his young collaborators came up with innovative search techniques using custom software what that does is makes the stars smear out and makes the Kuiper belt objects hold still it's been a lot of work but to do something as exciting as this has been just so much fun I've been plugging through the data today because it's fresh data and I just really really wanted to know what the answer was well we would have been in big trouble if we didn't find the KBO in time so there was this pressure but honestly we had the best people in the world working on the problem and we did it we just do the math right to software crunch the pixels and then I create this graphic and from that point on it's what I call wet where that's what you got in your head in reality KBO's are moving against the fixed stars mark came up with a way of making them more obvious by flipping that around and making the stars appear to move and any KBO's stands still right in the middle there's something is just holding dead constantly and that's the car verbal talk you can't argue with that it was a high-tech variant of the approach that had been instrumental in exploring the Pluto system right from the start but at the core it's a technique that hasn't really changed since Tom bounced a you have two pictures of the sky taken in two different times and you're looking for the stuff that moves as soon as you see something real there is absolutely no question about it as soon as it flashes on the screen in just a millisecond there it is it's real and you know I've found another Kuiper belt object but finding a kbo is only half the battle is it located where new horizons can reach it with available fuel once you have the orbit and we know where the spacecraft is and where it's going to be we can figure out how much fuel the spacecraft is going to need to use to get to these objects with more Hubble time New Horizons got a pleasant surprise it looked like we might actually have to burn the engines to miss the objective which was very exciting you know it's good thing we looked because you would want to run into one of these things it's cold classical's they're pretty much as they were 4.5 billion years ago they're little fossils that's incredible we have no idea what they're gonna look like so with potential targets found at last it was on the Pluto I'm feeling pretty exhilarated at this point no you're at the top of the roller coaster you were about to go down that dizzying thrilling ride into the system just see Pluto they're getting bigger and bigger it gives me goosebumps today we're only a few months away from the encounter we're less than an astronomical unit the distance between the Earth and the Sun that distance away from this fascinating object it's the last major body in our solar system that we really need to visit to be putting the capstone on the initial reconnaissance of the solar system it's heartwarming and it feels like something that makes a career worthwhile a spacecraft goes New Horizons is a very small team but still we've been working on this for over a decade we have waited first the four years that we couldn't hardly think about because we were running so fast and then it is hope we wait and we wait and now we are ready to begin the encounter we have had delayed gratification the year of Pluto is you know simultaneously a beginning and an ending it's an ending in that we are completing our objective we're accomplishing the flyby of the Pluto system for the first time but it's also the beginning of a whole new chapter for science of really being able to explore these objects as the data comes down over a period of months you know in bringing in postdocs and the younger scientists who some of whom were in high school when we started this project and now they have their PhDs and they are spectacular experts and very talented at what they do I was in preschool when Alan first started talking about a Pluto mission and finishing high school and starting college when it was built and in grad school for the crews having young people come into these programs gaining the experience they're going to be the next generation of explorers we've never been to a cameo we've never been anywhere close to a cameo this this is the would be most unexplored area of the entire solar system which is another wise saying this is the most unknown area that we as humans can reach with spacecraft we can't wait to get to Pluto and to July 14th and see what the surface looks like we're ready to go and it's show time we are capable of continuing an adventure that humanity began hundred thousand years ago as our ancestors walked out of Africa and we are continuing that exploration and this country is in the forefront of doing that [Music] you

becomes a feat of engineering excellence the most complex machine ever built to bring humans to and from space Gallery and eventually construct the next stop on the road to space exploration we are on a true spaceship as thirty years of flight draw to a close its legacy is one of unsurpassed achievement tragedy overcome and opportunity the NASA space shuttle [Music] Space Shuttle Endeavor is rolling out to launch pad 39a at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida [Music] in 24 missions flown over 20 years endeavour has logged more than 103 million miles in space the last of NASA shuttles to be built endeavour prepares for her final flight sts-134 I marvel that when I when I see the space shell up close and personal behind the panels where we have Hardware plumbing black boxes electronic devices and that sort of thing the workmanship that I see in this is astounding and that points right at the people that do this when you integrate all that together it results in and what I think has been a marvelous program with the Space Shuttle well before any shuttle reaches the launch pad however a staggering amount of work is required the parts plans and people necessary to make each launch span the entire nation one single goal is the focus the safety of the orbiter and earth Queen you've got all these people all these folks that are in their 20s some of them in their 30s and they are no kidding in charge of some part of the space shuttle some part of the space station or some part of the plan and every one of those people absolutely believes that they are the one that makes the difference on getting those astronauts back down to the ground at NASA's Michoud assembly facility in New Orleans production begins on the shuttles external fuel tank the last of 136 produced here since 1973 each one a hundred and fifty four feet tall and twenty seven point six feet around is capable of handling five hundred and thirty-five thousand gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen enough to fill 13375 average household bathtubs three versions of the external tank were created during the program in an effort to reduce the tanks overall weight and allow for heavier shuttle payloads around the same time in Clearfield Utah technicians at ATK launch systems start work on the shuttle system solid rocket motors or boosters fire together these SRBs produced nearly 6 million pounds of thrust about 83% of a thrust needed to push the orbiter into space the remaining 17% is furnished by the shuttles three main engines fueled by the external tank unlike the orange external tank that is used only once the Boosters detached themselves and parachute into the Atlantic Ocean they are then retrieved refurbished and reused on later missions the shuttle missions crew is assigned folks on there that are like my brothers and sisters I mean we really do get close after a year training for a flight and having flown in space together and there's a special bond that comes with that right up until launch a shuttle crew will train in a variety of critical regimens some basic others specific to their mission simulators safety and contingency science experiments and underwater in the world's largest indoor pool sts-134 astronauts floating in actual spacesuits trained to work during extra vehicular activities or EVs the neutral buoyancy lab or NBL at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston is the best simulation of microgravity on earth an ideal for practicing spacewalks one of the most amazing facilities that we work in is the NBL the neutral buoyancy lab and the divers and the guys who run helped us run the robotic arm are all there to ensure that our spacewalks are flawless their efforts in that pool have helped us and made us able to have this program every step of a spacewalk every step of EPA is so critical and even though we see it every day that's what not one little safety tether could be life or death for every hour that they spend in orbit they'll spend five to six hours training for that same task so we've built up from the suit engineers and suit technicians who help them get into the suit now we've got trainers who help them learn how to use the suit and learn how to understand the suit and then we've got divers who support them whether in the pool the closer they get to actually flying in the suit the team of people who help them tends to grow maybe not exponentially but it's certainly getting bigger a 12-person crews kept a week-long vigil while the barge carrying with ET made the 900 mile trek from Louisiana to Florida's Central East Coast the iconic orange external tank finally arrives at the Kennedy Space Center one month later the et is mated to the solid rocket boosters to form the backbone of the stack now all that's missing is the spacecraft itself when an orbiter returns from a mission processing for the next flight begins almost immediately it's a task requiring no less than 650,000 hours of labor this includes the removal of its three liquid fuel engine and their replacement by three from the previous mission [Music] they've been refurbished inspected and tested at the Stennis Space Center but most of its flight preparations complete endeavour is towed in what is called the roll over a short rolled over a quarter mile distance on a thirty six wheeled vehicle from the orbiter processing facility the old pf2 the VAB here it undergoes its flight configuration the rollout looking now much like it will at liftoff the space shuttle is carried to the launch pad atop the six million pound crawler-transporter at a blazing pace of less than a mile amount not exactly warp speed at our peak carrying full load we get a right around 38 feet per gallon not too bad for an original 1965 hybrid vehicle with low miles the 3.4 mile journey takes up to six hours just enough time to appreciate the roots picturesque surroundings Kennedy Space Center is situated on a National Wildlife Refuge [Music] bald eagles osprey and vultures are just a few of the scores of bird species regularly spotted in local skies both land and sea are home to a wide variety of creatures including manatees dolphins and of course the ever-present alligator visitors are always urged to watch their step now on the launch pad the orbiter is ready to take on its main pay load testing assures that the multi ton cargo is secure and safely stowed in the payload Bay before the technicians certified the orbiter is ready for launch flying t-38 aircraft from Ellington field and Houston the crew members arrive at Kennedy's Shuttle Landing Facility but finally the day comes when you're there and you're getting ready to launch and you're going to launch countdown and it's like going up the hill on that rollercoaster this is full of expectation and you're both thrilled and terrified at the same time because anything could go wrong but when it goes right it's a thing of beauty if there are no issues or concerns technicians begin fueling the external tank with volatile liquid hydrogen and oxygen the predominant emotion is pride there's a tremendous sense of pride in all that that not only that you do but that your teammates do that people in this this very firing room do and folks all across the country this is shuttle launch control t-minus nine minutes at the t-minus nine minute plate the launch director leads one finally we finally come out of the hold at t-minus nine minutes I sit back and watch my data but I know that there are souls on board that's chef Anne whose lives are depending on the launch team to make the right decisions because I don't think about that consciously the decision-maker launched authority and responsibility I know what's there but I do think consciously about the crew and the people were about to about to put on top of a controlled explosion and get to order verify ready to reserve count at Dover 1 OKC pvp pvp go EP 6 pcs go help you Houston flight is go after nearly three years hundreds of thousands of hours logged by engineers technicians scientists seamstresses electricians and other program workers across the globe we have main engine start two one the shuttle makes its way Skype at liftoff 6.6 million pounds of thrust begin hurtling the vehicle and crew at speeds that will reach 17,500 miles per hour the shuttle is like no other machine ever built for its launch to succeed more than a million parts must move together perfectly how this engineering marvel came to be as an amazing story that begins in the early 1970s the yet Nam war is divisive and costly the economy is sliding into recession and with the race to the moon already won the Apollo program is cancelled a [Music] new mission is sought for NASA to send humans into space but Mars for many the next logical step on the path of exploration is dismissed as too costly a destination for a country preoccupied with events back on earth instead on January 5th 1972 another destination is selected low-earth orbit as early as the mid 1960s NASA had concluded that the technology was available to build and fly a reusable spacecraft President Nixon really liked the idea and told the NASA Administrator go do it and the NASA Administrator got a call from OMB the next morning someone there and said hey what the president really meant to say was you're gonna get this much money and so do as best you can with the space transportation system and our choice logically was we have to have a vehicle first and so that that was the birth of the Space Shuttle as the first in the three-part space transportation system many designs were considered often they combined the best features of different concepts at that time they were looking at having jet engines on the shuttle for landing and for transporting it across the country the idea of the lifting bodies was to bring ass home conventional runway and previously all of our thick paths which were capital and down in the ocean someone came up with the idea of a vehicle that could land like an airplane the key thing was to understand aerodynamic stability across the hypersonic supersonic subsonic and landing speed type of environments that a single vehicle has to fly safely that was a key thing that was learned from those and you'll see it reflected in the shape of the space shuttle one was the use of a lifting body an aircraft with no conventional wings only its fuselage would keep the aircraft airborne and guided safely back to earth they were known as a flying bathtub for the first half the m2 f1 was towed behind a car souped up potty act whitey Whiteside drove that Pontiac across the light that at about 120 miles per hour dragging us flying bathtub behind it as well as ground breaking their tests could also prove ground shake the x24 be a lifting body with wings was the first such craft to land on an actual runway as all shuttles would eventually do early on the space shuttle was going to have jet engines to return for horizontal landing much like an airliner the x-15 had proven fairly specifically that they can make horizontal landings very accurately unpowered flying a steep glide slope that they could do a horizontal unpowered landing with the shuttle as they tried to narrow its size shape and weight engineers also considered how this new orbiter would be propelled safely out of the reach of Earth's gravity at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville home of the rockets that had sent every Mercury Gemini and Apollo astronaut into space design teams would devise the partially reusable propulsion system that would finally be about the main engines were always something we paid very close attention to lots of moving parts lots of lots of high-energy and very tight places and very cold liquid open one side of a very small wall and very hot on the other side and that thing finally that off for me it just showed the power of a space shuttle main engine in and then there's three on the back of an orbiter and then there's the two solid rocket motors that was probably the spark that got me so interested in the space shuttle program in general and what it took to actually get one engine to light much less three and two boosters to take the shuttle to orbit as for the orbiter spiraling costs forced NASA to abandon equipping it with its own jet engines and escape pod originally it was going to be an air-breathing airplane that would fly to space as a rocket and then come back to earth the orbital maneuvering system pods that sit on the back now we're to be where deployable air breathing engines would come out and it would be able to fly from its intended point of landing to another place if the weather were bad or something like that NASA's new shuttle would essentially glide its way back to earth producing the components of this new space transportation system fell to familiar names in the space industry prime contractor Rockwell North American now Boeing had built the Apollo command/service module Morton Thiokol now ATK would build the solid rocket boosters and martin marietta now Lockheed Martin would construct the et responsibility for producing the space shuttles main engines went to Rocketdyne now Pratt Whitney there's a lot of teamwork that was going on it was bringing people from all across the country from Kennedy from Johnson from Marshall so many people involved that had to have work together know at the beginning there was a lot of anxiety that we weren't going to work together but when people got to know each other and could trust each other that's when the work became it was an amazing vehicle and a lot of ways way ahead of its time to have a reusable spacecraft they could carry such tremendous amounts of cargo to space was unprecedented September 1976 more than four-and-a-half years after President Nixon signed off on its development America's new spacecraft Constitution gets its first close up before the cameras the orbiter itself is well received by the public but impassioned fans of a particular long cancelled television series called Star Trek wanted it called something else they staged a successful write-in campaign and the orbiter was renamed for the starship featured on the show thus NASA's new shuttle would be the enterprise boldly going as no spacecraft had ever gone before whatever its name this bird still needed to prove he could fly in an age before computer simulations balsa wood models and Windtunnel testing was the only means to test the airliner sized glider we put together a very aggressive flight test profile that consisted of data points continuously all the way down they were just not there was not a matter of ten seconds went by without another either a pitch doublet or a rudder kick or an angle of attack sweep the things that really turn on a test pilot to fly them as accurately as possible August 12th 1977 on a crystal-clear California morning high above the Mojave Desert to NASA test pilots ready for enterprises first flight the plan was for Fred Hayes jr. and Gordon Fullerton to lift the orbiter off a modified 747 then land on a dry lakebed 15,000 feet below the thing that we were most concerned about was if we were going to be able to get to a launch speed if Fitz Fulton was going to be able to put the 747 into a slight dive so that we would have enough lift on the enterprise to when he did push the separation button blow the bolts to lift away from the airplane without hidden fits his tail and of course both of us were interested in the pilots on the 747 Fitz Fulton and Tom mcmerkin sit and wait for the command to release and steer their massive aircraft out from under enterprise there were still questions about whether they gonna actually happen as we from those simulations and the analysis and everything there's a very loud thump when the shuttle separates there was always a question was coming on slide back hit the tail at 747 but we couldn't see that but we could after a few seconds we could tell it didn't hit us and so the chase called clear once we reached the 240 knots and Fitz called on speed I think he really pushed some of the sensors he was looking at in order to let us get to there but and we appreciated that but once once we heard fit say on speed I pushed the separation button and we we just broke free we had about one and a half G's of lift honestly that was probably the most exciting moment in the approach and landing test to feel and be there when the shuttle separated from the platform ever file accounts this first freefall test is a success [Music] five weeks later Enterprise is brought to twenty two thousand for her second freefall test pilots Joe Engel and dick truly have only two minutes to capture flight and maneuvering data before landing the aircraft again without any engine it was a real team effort the challenge was for dick truly and I to fly that profile and fly those data points those maneuvers as precisely as possible to give them the best data possible it was it was a test pilot ream a total of 16 taxi captive and drop tests confirm the sounds of the crafts design and green-lighted production of the first space worthy for [Music] Columbia NASA's first orbiter is fittingly named after the first American vessel to circumnavigate the however Columbia quickly becomes a daunting challenge for NASA it's complex makeup had engineers struggling constantly to reduce Columbia's weight and simplify construction especially frustrating was keeping the orbiters ceramic tiles attached to its fuselage more than $25,000 fit together to protect Columbia from the searing 3,000 degree heat of reentry we were having a lot of problems with the thermal protection system of the tiles the way we were trying to glue a moment with this wouldn't stay off and we had to come up with a way of making sure that they'd stay on and we had some really great people that work that and that's why it took such a long time I had hoped it was not going to take that long since so John and I were named as a crew so we had a lot more time to Train than what I had we'd both initially planned the requirement was to be able to handle temperatures like 2500 degrees have to occur on the surface of the the TPS and that's five times what your oven is at the home that you bake cookies under at max the other problem is weight because after all this is an airplane so you can't have a metallic system on it that weighs tons it has to be extremely lightweight and in fact the shuttle tiles are about 90% air and that gives the combination of being able to be temperature resistant and yet at the same time light each orbiter has a unique number of protective tiles Challenger was built with the most 30 1088 while Atlantis has the fewest a mere 24,000 177 over in Palmdale they had put on their first effort of putting the tiles on to protect the aluminum from the heating then we're going to get on reentry and some of those tiles would they put them on in the daytime next morning the tiles were on the hangar floor and so that was real scary that they we could lose some tiles whether they're on orbit and really have a problem with the heat coming back on reentry Columbia had a lot of tiles missing yet needed quite a bit of work before we could deliver it to the Cape and we scrounged throughout the city of Lancaster for rkv which was the the material we use to glue the tiles on with more glue did keep the tiles in place however water was literally ripping them apart it turns out an instant we hit rained the tiles who almost exploded the tiles fabrication process was modified and the problem overcome other shuttle design features proved less problematic and more groundbreaking a computerized digital flight control system now common in commercial and military aircraft was developed for the orbiter in flying the space shuttle you were so aware that you aren't necessarily talking to the shuttle you're talking to a computer who in turn was going to talk to the to the shuttle barriers of race and gender were falling everywhere and America's core of shuttle astronauts would become more reflective of the nation it served there's been a lot that's that the shuttle era has done to bring space flight into into the domain of the average person we know it's not just crew-cut white test pilots anymore it's it's the essentially the United Nations that flies on the space shuttles it's people of every description that look very much like the rest of us the astronaut selection process reflected a changing nation and the changing NASA at the time all the astronauts were military test pilots and there were no females so it was kind of like one of those dreams that you hope will happen someday but you didn't really think would the NASA astronaut class of 1978 the largest in the agency's history came from all walks of American life physicists meteorologists fighter pilots scientists for the first time women and african-americans when I came into the astronaut program in 78 there were three african-americans that came in at the same time and it was the first time that NASA had hired african-americans we had Fred Gregory who was a test pilot and then to Ron McNair who was a mission specialist and I came in as a mission specialist so all three of us were excited about flying in space and we all all three of us recognized that we were really going to open up the envelope for other African Americans to fly in space while the new class of NASA astronauts trained for subsequent shuttle flights Columbia was undergoing preparations for the program's maiden voyage STS 1 veteran astronaut John Young one of the 12 men to set foot on the moon is in command this pilot is first-time flyer Bob Crippen to be sitting home board and up there with my buddy John Young and get to experience the whole thing from a scent to be an on-orbit flying reentry it was with more of the high points in my career [Music] together they would travel over a million miles and circle the earth 36 times the launch finally occurred we've been waiting and postponing and postponing and when it finally lifted off and we knew it was going and achieved orbit we were wrong and anxious anticipation for what was going to happen next launched like a rocket two days earlier Columbia lands as a glider on the dry lake bed of Edwards Air Force Base in California watching out out the window watching the sea and the clouds rush by it actually gave her a sense of speed more so than then when we were up in orbit being a child I think they were all very relieved because they've been some concern because we had lost some tiles initially going on the orbit and they didn't know whether we'd lost any on the bottom or not slow down over the San Joaquin Valley we do a big turnaround to land on the lake bed that first ride I remember when John went into a bank of a big left bank I looked down to lake bed and there's thousands of people out there I think a child look at almost folks would come out to see you later Joe Engle was chased you're his voice coming in on final talking to John Young and crip in the airplane that they were right on glide slope coming in for a landing and then have that landing and then have John Young do his young dance he was just so elated it was such a magnificent flying machine to him at that time the first time I really saw a real shuttle with Columbia when it was out on a lake bed after the landing man I'm walking around it I couldn't believe they said that big a mass up in the air people really thought this was all impossible so what we do what we have done and shown and demonstrated through the shuttle program is we've shown that we can take the impossible and make it possible thousands of spectators lined up along the landing strip to greet the shuttle and it's two-man crew anyone who is associated with the program or they're just to see the shell returned I think felt a lot of pride in our country and our space program and so that those emotions were you know finally release and you said wow you know the flight was done safely they're back home the shell really does work it's a great program it's got a great future ahead of hey this thing works and we got it back all in one piece which is what we wanted to do while Columbia's return was spectacular it would renew NASA engineers worries about the shuttles thermal protection system during the post landing inspection 148 of the orbiters tiles were found shattered and 16 more were missing due to the effects of an overpressure wave while that and other issues were addressed the 50-ton Columbia would be placed atop the specially configured 747 and ferried back to Florida and processing for its next mission it's a massive enterprise it's over eight stories tall sitting on the ground and it's you never get over that sight it's really awesome after the shuttle lands there's a processing procedure for the show post flighting int checking the tires checking the struts major get the right correct measure and then when the shuttle is ready to mate with worthy 747 we would tow underneath and then they would lower the space shuttle down on the supports on top of the aircraft take off on take offs from the extra long runways of Edwards Air Force Base [Music] the Shuttle Carrier aircraft crew of four would soon grow accustomed to the smell of burning rubber that's the intense heat generated by their plane spinning tires as they carried two massive aircraft at more than 100 miles an hour the average range of a 747 is about 5,000 miles but due to its weight configuration and special flight requirements the SCA can travel only 1,000 miles at a time a full term in a jet can take several Ziff country to avoid bad cruising at more than 250 miles per hour the jumbo jet burns 40,000 pounds of fuel per hour that's a hundred and thirty pounds per mile or the length of a football field per gallon no wonder it has to make several stops before reaching Florida's east coast we would get a spacecraft back go over it again be sure that we could reuse it repair it where we had to do had never been never been done before and so I think it's one of the marvelous things about the space shuttle was we found a way to turn this spacecraft around and use it again before the end of 1982 Columbia would fly for more mission liftoff of America's space shuttle including STS five the first with a crew of more than two astronauts [Music] challenger ii orbit in the shuttle fleet made her maiden flight on april 4th 1983 STS six deployed a communication satellite and feature the first spacewalk of the shuttle era just two months later shuttle Challenger is back in orbit this time with the first American woman in space physicist dr. Sally Ride was a member of commander Bob Crippen's STS 70 that deployed Canadian and Indonesian satellites during the six-day mission [Music] challenger was readied for flight in less than two minutes another massive first shuttling the first African American space an Air Force combat pilot guy Bluford for me it was an exciting moment because it was something that I had been training for for 15 to 16 months and so I was looking forward to the experience of flying in space in 1984 286 the newest orbiter discovery would fly a record six missions and liftoff liftoff of mission 51 d and a seven-member crew of discovery carrying into space satellites international astronauts even a US senator and a congressman one year after Discovery's debut Atlantis flew her first mission a new orbiter joins a shuttle fleet and it has cleared the tower STS 51 J there was also one of seven classified missions the space shuttle would fly for the Department of Defense by the end of 1985 the space shuttle program had completed 23 issues including 9 that year alone each successful flight had the under tenant consequence of convincing some that space woman once considered among humankind's most inherently dangerous endeavors had become routine that note would soon be tragically dispelled well I am so excited to be here amid much fanfare christa mcauliffe an elementary school instructor from Concord New Hampshire had been chosen from among 11,000 applicants to be NASA's first teacher in space I would like to humanize the space age by giving a perspective from the nine astronaut because I think the students will look at that and say this is an ordinary person this ordinary person is contributing to history and if they can make that connection then they're going to get excited about history they're gonna get excited about the future they're going to get excited about space the American public's interest in its space program was renewed by her participation and was eager to see her alive commanding the flight was dick Scobee his pilot was Michael Smith serving as challengers mission specialists our Judy Resnik Ellison Onizuka and Ron McNair journey McAuliffe as a payload specialist was Greg Jarvis from the start STS 51 L was plagued by delays mostly due to unseasonally cold temperatures in Florida rather than give pause for thought the delays only tried the nation's patience everyone had seemed was itchy to go January 28th the ground temperature of launch pad 39b was a frigid 36 degrees ice could be seen on the launch vehicle despite concerns voiced by some shuttle managers reluctantly decided to press ahead for a late morning liftoff we have main engine start three two one liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower challenger go at throttle up at 11:39 booster twice the speed of sound the challengers fuselage breaks apart from the inside out America's space program suffers its first fatality in flight all seven challenger crew members okay everybody stay off the telephones make sure you maintain all your data start pulling it together we come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans to share the grief that we all feel and perhaps in that sharing to find the strength to bear our sorrow and the courage to look for the seeds of hope the investigation headed by former Secretary of State William Rogers would fault a solid rocket booster re-rendered affected by the bitter but the Commission's findings also addressed the human factor the role played by shuttle program managers in sending challenger aloft that day the shuttle program came to a halt it took more than two and a half years of arduous engineering analysis and painful soul-searching before a retooled and reborn shuttle would return to fluid challenge it was tough because it not only represented a breakdown in communications but it just it represented everything that's wrong you know wrong about an agency like like we are we're segments of the agency weren't talking to each other and didn't know everything that we should know we thought we knew where all the risks were and had them pretty well contained the solid rocket boosters had called the accident obviously there was something that had slipped through so we went back throughout you know their complete vehicle all the systems and did a complete review and trying to find any other things that we may have missed that may be lurking there when things are really starting to look smooth and you're starting to get maybe overconfident in a way then it's time for you to step back think about what you're doing go back and look do some additional testing and see if there's something that you really hadn't anticipated that is going on with your systems your a lot of that time we got a lot of criticism that maybe the agency lost its edge there were folks inside the agency that started started losing their confidence thinking maybe we can't do this anymore two and a half years later and we flew and then landed that flight and showed that no we really can't overcome really really large problems will tough technical problems today just like we could 10 years ago 20 years ago 150 years ago that was that was an important milestone [Music] every clears the on September 29th 1988 975 days after the loss of Challenger and her crew the orbiter discovery returns six veteran astronauts to space to deploy a tracking and data relay Center important to a number of NASA missions STS 26 proved to come back milestone over space chakra and initiated a tradition that survives with the program today during the flight we had roses show up in the Mission Control Center six roses five red one white and there was a card attached to it and it simply said congratulations return to flight we wish you well and it was signed Marc Terry and Mackenzie Shelton didn't know who they were but after the flight we threw the floral company we tracked them down so we could send him some pictures and and something to thank them

r sending the roses to Mission Control so the next slide roses show up again and again it's five roses for the members of the crew and one rose for those who have lost their lives in this endeavour and so this family they have become part of our family and they haven't missed a flight since every flight since that time and in to date and I suspect they're going to go right with us to the end the shuttle program STS 26 ended on October 30 1988 at Edwards Air Force Base California with discoveries safe landing on runway one set the triumphant crew was greeted warmly by Vice President George Bush on behalf of a proud and grateful nation there's something special about a return to flight that that makes you you have some trepidation because it's still fresh in your mind that you're frail and and you can make mistakes and you're human in the spring of 1990 the one and a half billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope was loaded into Space Shuttle Discovery's payload Bay and on April 24th was sent aloft to be deployed to earth orbit on sts-31 early discovery go for Hubble release as envisioned Hubble would return never-before-seen images detailing our universe as it was millions upon millions of years before soon it would become clear that Hubble pictures were not several days later if not a couple of weeks we found out after we were back on earth that it had a problem with its vision and most of us were just devastated you know that year we had this marvelous instrument that we had put on orbit and it was gonna be useless it turned out that it wasn't useless at all because even as with its flaw it was still a much better telescope than anything if we had you know on earth a shuttle mission dedicated to the telescope's repair was planned in essence Hubble's nearsightedness would be corrected with a new pair of glasses liftoff of the space shuttle Endeavour on an ambitious mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope we finally flew sts-61 which was the first Hubble servicing nation absolutely incredible mission you cannot take the 84 inch mirror out of the telescope it's part of structure too big it's there so by putting in one box called co-star and we're able to correct air brake light for five other instruments of all the space shuttle missions we've flown it was without a doubt the most ambitious flight but the one that I think demonstrated NASA's can-do attitude its technological skill its technical capability and the spirit of its people two teams of astronauts made a record five back-to-back spacewalks to refurbish Hubble and realize her potential to all and a staff [Music] [Applause] while Hubble servicing missions were very important the true gift of a maneuverable shuttle assume realized in a very different rescue mission booster ignition and liftoff of the maiden voyage of Endeavour on a satellite rescue mission months earlier in May of 1992 the seven astronauts of sts-49 overcame initial setbacks to pluck the hundred and eighty million dollar Intel SATs six communication satellite from an unusable orbit it was going to be a very simple rendezvous you know get close bring the satellite down close and grapple it with the remote manipulator system everything that could go wrong went wrong they got up there to capture it the bar we tap the satellite and the and the with the bar and the satellite started moving out of control it can be very difficult catching something like a tumbling satellite in space the slightest touch or miss touch by the astronaut with the equipment and you can send that satellite tumbling here like you're the one who I'm in a jar like you say alright okay the other time right is just right so it was very touch-and-go on that mission actually commander Dan brandenstein and pilot Kevin Chilton are preparing for the upcoming terminal initiate burn after several days of failed attempts with endeavours remote arm commander Dan brandenstein literally tries a new approach yeah real easy guys and endeavors helm brandenstein delicately maneuvers the orbiter up to the four and a half tonne Intelsat six the satellite is is rolling out of control in three different axes at once and you could actually fly the shuttle and fly this maneuver around and keep it aligned with it right here three people grabbed 18,000 pounds aware that any miscue could endanger not only the satellite but also the ride home spacewalkers peer through it Tom Akers and Rick he'd reach out and secure the satellite by hand [Music] [Music] a night job guys until sat 6 is released from the cargo bay with a new mini rocket motor for a gentle push to its proper orbit where it remains today fully functional and as the shuttle program ature so it seemed it relationships between the worlds spacefaring nations on STS 47 the 50th space shuttle mission saw the orbiter endeavour back in space on September 12 1992 the mission was a cooperative Space Lab venture between Japan and the United States that brought the first Japanese astronaut into orbit as a member of the seven person shuttle foods the Space Shuttle has launched people from different nations around this world that used to feel they could never ever work together and it has ushered us from the Cold War to this really cooperative space program that we have with our international partners including the former Soviet regardless of what language you speak you speak in love space and that's pretty cool people we have a lot in common with engineers and scientists that's kind of fun working program like this on february 3rd 1995 Eileen Collins the first woman to pilot a shuttle was at the helm as discovery gave the u.s. its first up-close look at the MIR Space Station Collins flew the shuttle through a series of intricate maneuvers approaching within 37 feet of the Russian spacecraft and later performing the fly around by hand and liftoff with a space shuttle Atlantis on a mission that will herald a new day of international cooperation in space four months later on June 27th 1995 shuttle Atlantis would lift off from the Kennedy Space Center to begin STS 71 the u.s. space programs one hundredth human space mission it would take two more days before Atlantis caught up with and performed the first shuttle docking with the MIR space station orbiting 220 miles above the earth the most unique and historic celebration took place [Applause] as the MIR Space Station welcomed its first American guests cosmonauts and astronauts together broke figurative bread tortillas and fruit to be exact in a renewed spirit of cooperation together shuttle and MIR formed the largest flying spacecraft the world had yet to see it tipped the scales at 250 metric tons more than a half a million pounds between 1994 98 the shuttle-mir program would involve 11 shuttle missions including in 1996 STS 76 which he began a continuous u.s. presence aboard the Russian space station with a visit by Atlantis barely fluent in Russian astronaut Shannon lucid a biochemist embarked upon a mission that would dramatically enhance our understanding of life in space when she finally landed at Edwards Air Force Base on shuttle Atlantis she held the female space endurance record for spending a hundred and eighty eight days in orbit a hero's welcome was in store I'm here to say welcome home to Shannon lucid by the time shuttle Mir ended with STS 91 seven American astronauts had completed extended stays aboard the Russian space station Tatiana met Eva I became very good friends with and I remember us sitting in Red Square having dinner together with a full moon and remembering when I was a child all those those parades as May Day parades with the tanks going by and here we were sitting there having a nice dinner under the with a lot of friendship so it just goes to show how space can unite people and that's one of I think one of the biggest benefits eight cosmonauts had flown to Mir on the u.s. shuttle and NASA astronaut norm thagard had become the first American to fly there or any aboard a Soyuz space [Music] in 2001 15 years after its commissioning Muir would be abandoned to break up and burn in Earth's atmosphere by then the process of building upon mears legacy of international cooperation in space had already begun whereas sts-61 had helped establish the hubble space telescope as an icon of American ingenuity sts-95 would update the heroes credentials of one john clam on october 29th 1998 almost 37 years after becoming the first American to orbit the earth as an original mercury 7 astronaut Glenn now a 77 year old former US senator made his return to space in contrast to his first flight a three orbit four and a half hour for a inside the snug friendship 7 capsule liftoff of discovery with a crew of six astronauts heroes one American legend sts-95 would take eight days and circle the earth 134 times my main reason for being on that shuttle flight was to do research on Aging I was 77 we went up and you know NASA has charted some 52 different things changes that occur in the human body and you've been to space for a period of time and the several of those are very similar to what happens to the natural process of Aging right here on earth body's immune system changes you get less resistant to disease and infection body's ability to absorb protein back into the muscles changes for the young people up there and for elderly here on earth the objective was to take those things that are the same and see if we couldn't find any differences between my experience up there and they're younger and the younger people I would fly with and with the idea of finding in the human body what turns these different systems on and off if we could do that we might be able to make it possible for people to stay in space longer but without harmful effects and maybe cut out some of the frailties of old age right here on earth I really was happy to be because that flight an interesting twist of fate astronaut Glenn not only inspired both the young and old around the globe but also a fresh political science and economics graduate lori garver the 18th deputy administrator of nasa having the ability at nasa to fly him again in space after his first flight was something we I think gave the nation and it really helped explain what we were doing on the space shuttle John Glenn was very very focused on doing that experience those experiments for both I think the older generation but he was also an inspiration to people growing up discovery carried a variety of payloads and research experiments arguably the one most valuable was Glenn himself not only did he provide first-time data on what spaceflight might do to the body of a septa Gennari Glenn also renewed the interest of the nation and the world in America's space shuttle program while the program had and continued to successfully deploy winning service science probes and satellites as well as conduct on-orbit research the Space Shuttle undertook a new long-range task perfectly suited to her specialized capabilities you've got a spacecraft that can carry at least seven people into orbit and with those seven people you can do a huge amount of work one mission you can do multiple evh you've got multiple crew members you've got a huge payload and it's all kinds of capabilities to be able to construct less than two weeks after the Glenn's returned to Earth a Russian Proton rocket departs the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying the Zarya module the first component of the new International Space Station liftoff of the proton rocket and the Zarya control module International Space Station is underway two weeks after that space shuttle Endeavour follows up with delivery of America's unity module the second piece of this largest space station puzzle ever to be constructed oh yeah [Music] mob until July 2000 will the Russian Zvezda module yet finally allowing for treating Russian cosmonauts and their American expedition one commander bill shepherd to journey aboard a Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station and begin humankind's continuous extraterrestrial presence across the world people are very very interested in and delighted by the International Space Station and the science that has taken place there since only an orbiters payload Bay could hold the station's largest components the multi-year multi-million servicing of the ISS with cargo and crew would become primarily a job for the shuttle amid these dynamic station building missions one seemingly simple and relatively uncomplicated flight would prove problematic and threaten the very future of America's human spaceflight program since 1988 the Space Shuttle had completed 15 years of successful missions each was unique each had its own specific goals and tasks and each had its own dedicated crew of astronauts who trained exhaustively to meet and carry them out yet each of those 87 flights did have two things in common the safe launch liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery the safe land nose gear touchdown for the starch sts-107 seemed to be a mission out of sorts by the time Columbia was finally ready to fly on January 16th 2003 its planned 16-day mission had been delayed no fewer than 18 times all those delays have ultimately positioned the sts-107 as a sort of black sheep on the space shuttle programs launch schedule Columbia's crew commander Rick husband pilot Willie McCool and mission specialists Michael Anderson kapner chavala Dave Brown Laurel Clark and Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon would not go the National Space Station their flight would require nothing more risky than orbiting the earth booster ignition and liftoff of space shuttle Columbia with a multitude and International Space Research experiments 82 seconds after launch what was later described as a suitcase size transcript frozen foam insulation breaks off Columbia's external tank and strikes the leading edge of the orbiters left wing a routine same-day video review of the launch would reveal nothing unusual however higher resolution tracking camera film processed overnight and reviewed on flight day - by the missions assent team showed otherwise you saw this little thing float toward the leading edge of the wing and like you know it was like a snowball hitting something and then just being pulverized but but when you saw it hit ooh we just we just winced because we knew you know the vehicles going 500 miles an hour or better it was inconceivable in hindsight that you could have that kind of impact at the speed that the vehicle was going and assumed that there was no damage and that's what we we allowed ourselves to feel comfortable that we were right and we were dead wrong due to limitations in the visual clarity the exact point of impact and extent of any damage could not be determined if the foam strike had compromised Columbia's integrity little if anything can be done to repair the orbiter in space one week after launch Mission Control emails the crew informing of the debris strike save for a relatively minor problem with a leaky refrigeration unit sts-107 had been without further incident as scheduled the order is given on the morning of February first for the Columbia crew to begin the landing procedure and come home to Florida traveling in excess of 12,"000 miles per hour the orbiters belly begins to glow red as it descends into Earth's atmosphere that's why I have just lost four separate temperature transducers on the left side of the vehicle hydraulic return temperatures as reentry started and as the ground track went went across the states there's a the ground track that course changes color you can tell where the shuttle is over what part of the country it is well that display stopped update you in other words that display to froze in a certain position well sometimes you have loss of data you have some problem with the system on the ground of where you'll have those kind of outages temporarily well this lasted a bit longer then the call went up to the crew you know call went up and no response well I know I just I just began to feel uneasy Columbia Houston UHF comm check [Music] at speeds above Mach 20 the stress becomes too much for the orbiter we do not have any valid data at this time the suitcase sized chunk of folk had indeed touched a bowling ball sized hole in the leading edge of Columbia's left wing within seconds internal temperatures spiked signaling the cascade of structural disintegration only 16 minutes from home space shuttle Columbia breaks apart in the skies over East Texas all seven crew members GC plant-wide is a block the doors happy at that moment I knew I knew we lost him the grief is heavy our nation shares in your sorrow and in your pride and today we remember not only one moment of tragedy but seven lives of great purpose and achievement within days hundreds of professionals from federal and state agencies across the country arrived in these Texas they are joined by local volunteers to help NASA recover and catalog debris from Columbia in the hopes of literally piecing together an answer to the accidents caused this is one of the many obstacles investigators are up against it was really heartwarming and very emotional for me too to see all of these people from around the country come in the Piney Woods of East Texas and spend days and weeks there marching out through these through the woods looking for bits and pieces of their orbiter and so forth if anybody ever wonders about the the strength of the backbone of this country then they ought to have the privilege like I do to meet these people who have come here to do this it just it shows you the fabric of what this country is made of determined to return to flight stronger and safer the grounded shuttle program had taken a fresh look at itself during my watch during my watch we lost the Columbia crew and clearly as a flight director of a context crew I think about those every day every day I come to work I need to be very vigilant I need to pay attention and I need the people that work for us in this business to pay attention to what you're doing because this is hard stuff that we do it's very dangerous we have not figured out a way to do a beam me up Scottie right now it takes a lot of hydrocarbons moving at very high speeds to fuel pumps at very high temperatures high pressures to get into space and it takes a tremendous amount of effort to get out of space back in the atmosphere and get to get home I was sent out to David Brown's parents home I'll never forget this moment when Judge Brown looked at me and said Leland my son is gone there is nothing can do to bring him back but the biggest tragedy would be if you don't continue to fly and carry on his legacy each of the remaining three orbiters was pulled apart and refurbished new capabilities were devised for the crew and mission controllers to assess and repair damage while on orbit processes and procedures were also reexamined and reinvigorated cruise safety would never again be taken for granted nearly two and a half years would pass before the nation would see another orbiter poised for launch from the Kennedy Space Center the time that we fly the flight it's something that it feels like we have flown many times so if things don't go well it becomes very very natural for us to know at certain points during the mission if this doesn't go well or if this significant system breaks when we have this type of emergency what's the most important thing we need to do now because we've been rehearsing it and it makes it look really easy you don't really get the full effect of how much real preparation how much real studying went into making it look that easy of all the changes accompanying the shuttles return to flight none was more significant than the one announced in early 2004 at NASA headquarters by President Bush our first goal is to complete the International Space Station by 2010 we will finish what we have started we will meet our obligations to our 15 international partners on this project the shuttles chief purpose over the next several years will be to help finish Assembly of the International Space Station in 2010 the Space Shuttle after nearly 30 years of Duty will be retired from service even though each shuttle was designed to fly 100 missions the Columbia accident investigation board called the shuttle an aging spacecraft with the odds of losing another orbiter and crew increasing with each subsequent flight NASA's human spaceflight program was faced with several basic challenges including coming up with a successor to the shuttle fleet however with an impending cancellation of the shuttle program looming shuttle managers recommitted themselves to the paramount task of safely completing the International Space Station it would become the program's mantra to be repeated over and over again not only to the media but also for every word in the shuttle program no launch schedule was too tight and no mission too important to be rushed we are to treat every flight in a sense as a return to flight this is truly a test program we go back we make sure everything is right we double-check and then we go commit into Flight Readiness review that we're actually ready to go fly on July 26 2005 discovery gets the shuttle program flying again this is shuttle launch control at t-minus 3 hours as our pilot now into the suit up row [Music] [Music] alerting elodie years ago million people who believe so deeply what we do good luck Godspeed and have a little fun up there t-minus 10 seconds go for main engine start seven six five three engines up and burning three two one and liftoff of space shuttle Discovery beginning America's new journey and the vehicle has cleared the tower among the many changes instituted the new r-bar pitch maneuver or backflip [Applause] will be used by each mission to the International Space Station at arrival the end over end flip allows the station crew to visually document the condition of the shuttles valium notes [Music] [Music] discovery and the sts-114 crew safely began a final phase of the shuttle programs historic journey with a smooth pre-dawn landing on August 9th 2005 at the Edwards Air Force Base California DD ray sweetie handy Vegas charlie Wendy and Eileen welcomed home friends with this practically rebuilt space transportation system each remaining shuttle mission would be safer than the one before and its final flight the safest it's almost like we've had kind of three different space shuttle programs first 10 years we're off learning how to fly the thing deploying satellites and flying laboratories in the bag review next 10 years we're doing more of that and we're going out on more and more spacewalks and we fly up to the MIR space station and in the last 10 years we use it to build about a million pound space station in orbit which wouldn't have been possible without Shaw it's a heck of a machine when you look at the Hubble Space Telescope that would not have been possible without shuttle and you look at the International Space Station which certainly would not have been possible without shuttle every launch is an emotional experience watching what this nation is done but nASA has done with the NASA contractor team it's awesome it's wonderful we didn't spend a dime in space not one single penny has been spent in space every single penny that went into the space shuttle program over its 30-plus years was spent right here on earth 1 creating jobs growing our economy creating technological development of which we never dreamed advancing science and technology even advancing the field of Aeronautics it just impresses me what people can do what people can do it's a it's a big machine it's a nice machine it's a fantastic engineering marvel in my opinion the whole space shuttle but what's the real marvel is behind it then make it go having a space show enabled us to be able to complete our science and do some really great things to advance the area of metallurgy without the space shuttle an experiment like this one could not have been conducted the shuttle is very important for us to learn and be able to conduct long period experiments out of the 50 states 48 of them have vendors that provide parts or equipment to the the space shuttle program so it's a vast cross-section of America that bakes the American space program what it is change is inevitable as much as people don't like change that's the only thing that's constant in our lives and we have to change we have to transition from shuttle to a new future which we're going to define which can be even better a future that allows us to explore beyond our home planet to seek our destiny to learn what we couldn't possibly learn if we were stuck in low-earth orbit and since its returned to flight the shuttle program has been almost singularly focused on completing construction of the space station I think back of all the challenges and all the things that had to work right you know a lot of these interfaces never came together before all the shuttle flights the 20-plus shuttle flights that went into assembly all the Soyuz flights to progress flights to see this station come together in assembly is a true testimony to the international partnership this is probably the most amazing research facility ever constructed in space and it's constructed internationally and it operates every day 24 hours a day doing world-class research internationally and there is no more amazing facility than what we have in orbit through and possibly beyond 2020 the ISS will serve as the world's first full-time research laboratory in microgravity among zero-g experiments already conducted aboard the station several have led to promising breakthroughs in research and treatment of cancer many other on-orbit science findings have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life back on earth in May 2009 Atlantis and its sts-125 crew took to space not to visit the ISS but to return to the Hubble Space Telescope for its final servicing mission on five spacewalks Atlantis astronauts repaired and upgraded a Hubble telescope to significantly improve its capacity to explore the depths of the universe until at least 2014 I think of all the finger prints that are all over this thing it's a phenomenal piece of machinery it's a phenomenal airplane and its really as an engineering mark the Space Shuttle will go down in history as one of the great flying machines that Americas has produced a space shuttle you know at this time was a vehicle for bringing people together from all around the planet and having us work in harmony for the betterment of humankind we may not have understood when we first built it what all we'd be able to accomplish with it and after many years we've realized just how useful it has been it's been a learning experience on how to operate and live in space what can you say about the Space Shuttle it has changed everything well the shuttle from my perspective is one of the great things that this nation has done it was a lot of pride like I said it's it's inspiring to come to work every single day to work on this program I'd go tomorrow if I had the opportunity for more than 30 years the fleet of thousands of Americans dedicated to its safety and success have toiled in exhilarating triumph heartbreaking tragedy and most often quiet obscurity their contributions have extended beyond the bounds of space among others shuttle-derived technologies have been used in developing an artificial heart and limbs three-dimensional biotechnology a light for treating tumors and children and improving crime prevention and wildfire detection from crawler driver to payload specialist from scuba dive to pilot from scientist to engineer they and many likely throughout the nation share a commitment to sending humankind safely into space that dedication as much as any other acclaim will be the legacy of America's space shuttle I think we'll be remembered in thousands of years you know as perhaps the most incredible technological feat of humans of our time as is the order

88,,Expedition 63 Launch to the International Space Station,"Three space travelers launched to the International Space Station aboard a Soyuz spacecraft.🚀  Astronaut Chris Cassidy of NASA and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of the Russian space agency Roscosmos lifted off at 4:05 a.m. EDT on a four-orbit, six-hour journey to our orbiting laboratory. This is the third spaceflight for both Cassidy and Ivanishin and the first for Vagner. During their mission on the station, they'll welcome NASA's Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon, which is currently targeted to launch no earlier than mid-to-late May.",NASA,erfXf08tuFg,"["">> WELL, IT'S A MILD AFTERNOON,  A SLIGHT BREEZE OVER AT THE  COSMO DROME IN KAZAKSTAN.  AND SITTING 160 F HIGH,  TO LAUNCH TO THE INTERNATIONAL  SPACE STATION, NASA'S CHRIS  CASSIDY.  AND ANATOLI, AND EVAN WAGNER,  SET TO PLAST OFF IN UNDER AN  HOUR FROM NOW AT 3:05 CENTRAL  TIME.  4:05:00 EASTERN TIME HERE IN THE US.  THIS IS THE FIRST CREW LAUNCH ON THE SOYUZ BOOSTER.  LAUNCHING FROM THE COSMO DROME.  IT WAS LAUNCHED DURING AN  UNMANNED MISSION LAST SUMMER IN  PREPARATION FOR TODAY.  AND WILL BE THE FIRST LAUNCH  FROM SITE 31 SINCE OCTOBER 2016, WHEN NASA'S SHANE KIMBA LAUNCHED ON SOYUZ 0-2 AS PART OF MISSION  49.  GOOD MORNING, GOOD AFTERNOON,  GOOD EVENING.  ANYWHERE YOU ARE TUNING IN.  I'M COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE  JOHNSON SPACE CENTER HERE IN  HOUSTON.  WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE  COUNTDOWN OF THE LAUNCH.  THE RIDE UPHILL AND THE JOURNEY  TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION OVER THE NEXT  SEVERAL HOURS. DOCKING AND ARRIVING AND GETTING THE CREW UP TO A FULL SIX-PERSON STRENGTH. LAUNCH CONTROLLERS ARE WATCHING  THE SYSTEMS ON THE ROCKET,  TALKING TO THE CREW AND LOOKING  AT EVERYTHING ON THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  NO ISSUES TRACKED W.  FUEL AND OXYGEN LOADING FOR THE  SOYUZ BEGAN A FEW HOURS AGO. ONE OF THE TEAMS ON THE LEFT  THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS IN  RUSSIA, THE CONTROL CENTER,  OUTSIDE IN COMMONWEALTH ORYOV  AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION HERE IN HOUSTON, COMING  TO YOU.  WE ARE HOPING BETWEEN CONTROL  ROOMS.  FLIGHT CONTROL REALLY NUMBER  ONE, THE USUAL INTERNATIONAL  SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM.  IN MICHIGAN CONTROL THE TEAM  WATCHING OVER THE CURRENT  EXPEDITION CREW.  OUR FLIGHT DIRECTOR IS ANTHONY  VARIER.  HE'LL LEAD THE ORBIT ONE TEAM  AND NEXT TO HIM IS EUROPEAN  ASTRONAUT ANDREA MOGUSEN.  THE CAPCOMM.  THE VOICE COMMUNICATION FOR  EVERYONE ON HOUSTON.  ON BOARD IS JESSICA MEIR AND  ANDREW MORGAN, AND THEY ARE UP  THERE WITH RUSSIAN COSMO NAUGHT  AND SPACE STATION COMMANDER OLEG SKRIPOCHKA.  ANDREW MORGAN LAUNCHED ON  JULY 20TH LAST SUMMER, 50th  ANNIVERSARY OF HUMANITY'S FIRST  STEP.  JESSICA MEIR FOLLOWED SHORTLY  AFTER, LAUNCH, IN SEPTEMBER.  ONCE THE CREW GETS THERE.  THE CREW WILL BE UP TO SIX.  R A WEEK.  ANDREW MORGAN AND OLEG  SKRIPOCHKA MAKE THEIR WAY BACK  TO PLANET EARTH ON APRIL 17TH,  BRINGING THE SPACE STATION DOWN  TO THREE.  AS I MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER, DOCKING FOR THE NEW CREW OCCURS  SEVERAL HOURS FROM NOW, AFTER  COMPLETING THE FOUR ORBIT  FLIGHT.  WE'LL BRING YOU COVERAGE OF THAT ON NASA TV. 8:30AM CENTRAL TIME FOR DOCKING. THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO DOCK AND  THE ZONA, NESDA, IT'S KNOWN AS M 45 MINUTES AFTER SEEING THE  COVERAGE WE SEE THE DOCKING.  ON THE JOURNEY UP THERE, THE  SOYUZ TRACKING AND TELOMETRY  WILL BE LINKED TO SPACE  STATIONSLINGED TO THE CONTROL  CENTER.  THROUGHOUT THE COVERAGE FOR THE  LAUNCH AND THE DOCKING AND HAT OPENING LATER.  IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THAT  WANT TO ASK.  WE'LL TAKE A COUPLE ON TWITTER,  YOU CAN ASK, USING THE HASHTAG  ASK NASA.  WE'LL TRY TO GET THROW A BUNCH  OF THOSE LATER ON.  TODAY'S LAUNCH IS NOTABLE FOR  THE FIR BEING THAT THIS CREW  UNDER WENT THEIR FINAL SPACE  FLIGHT PREPARATIONS DURING THE  HEALTH EMERGENCY ON THE  COVID-19, CHANGING THINGS TORE  PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE GLOBE,  THIS CREW AND THEIR PREPARATION  NO DIFFERENT.  THINGS LOOKING A LITTLE  DIFFERENT.  LIK A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.  YOU SEE THE PERSONNEL TRIMMED TO THE BARE NECESSITIES. ALL THE THEY DO EVERYTHING TO  STOP THEW WITH SICKNESS. THEY BEEN QUARANTINED FOR TWO  WEEKS, THEY HAVE BEEN IN  QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS,  LAMENTING CONTACT FOR THOSE  CLEARED AND IN QUARANTINE  THEMSELVES. IT'S STANDARDPROCEDURE, WE WANT TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY, WE DON'T  WANT THEM TO BRING A COLD OR  ANYTHING SEVERE UP TO THE SPACE  STATION. THE.  THANKS TO THE PROTOCOL THE CREW  SAFE AND READY TO LAUNCH. A NOTEWORTHY ASPECT IS DURING  THEIR STAY WE ARE EXPECTING THE  FIRST EVER CREW LAUNCH.  SIMILAR TO A FLIGHT, CURLY WILL  BE LAUNCHING IN.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO LAUNCH  BETWEEN MID TO LATE MAY.  AND ALL T TEAMS DOWN HERE ON  THE GROUND CONDITIONING.  ALL CREW FINISHING UP TRAINING  AND EVERYONE HAPPY TO SEE THE  SPACE FLIGHTS RETURNING.  THAT WILL TAKE PLACE DURING  EXPEDITION 63.  THE CREW WILL BE ON BOARD WHERE  WE CELEBRATE THE 20th  ANNIVERSARY.  YOU SEE THE I.S. S 20 AND A  BUNCH OF STUFF OVER NASA TV. WE ARE MARKING 20 YEARS OF HUMAN BEINGS LIVING ON BOARD THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  EVERY DAY SINCE NOVEMBER 1,  '99 -- NOVEMBER 2000 WE HAVE HAD MEN AND WOMEN LIVING ON BOARD  THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THERE IS AN ENTIRE GENERATION ON PLANET EARTH THAT AS LONG AS  THEY HAVE BEEN ALIVE.  NOT EVERY HUMAN HAS BEEN ON  EARTH WITH THEM. WE ARE CELEBRATING THAT  ACCOMPLISHMENT.  THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK FROM A  LOT OF DIFFERENT TEAMS,  ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND  DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS.  THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THEM  24 HOURS A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR  AND WE'LL HIT THE 20 YEAR MARK  IN NOVEMBER.  THAT MILESTONE MEANT SOMETHING  SPECIAL TO CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY,  AND HE HAD A COUPLE OF WORDS TO  SHARE. >> WELL, IT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR  THE SPACE STATION IT'S BEEN  OPERATING BRILLIANTLY FOR THOSE  20 YEARS, FOR ME PERSONALLY,  BILL SHEPHERD WAS THE COMMANDER  OF EXPEDITION 1.  I'M THE COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION  23 AT THE 20 YEAR MARK.  WE HAVE OUR ROOTS IN THE NAVY  SEAL TEAMS, I HAVE A  PARTICULARLY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW  THE NAVY GUISES IN COMMAND AND  THE BEGINNING AND END OF THAT 20 YEAR PERIOD. IT ALSSHOWSES THAT  THAT WE AS A COLLECTION OF  NATIONS BUILT, SUSTAINED,  OPERATED THE SPACE STATION, AND  ALL THAT SPEAKER  WE ARE  LEARNING, WILL HELP US GO TO THE MOON, MARS.  IMAGINE YOUR CAR WORKING FOR 20  YEARS, YOU ARE HAPPY WHEN YOU  GET TO THE 20th YEAR, AND THE  SPACE STATION IS DOING BETTER  THAN YOUR CAR. >> THEY ARE QUICK WORDS. WE WANT TO GET TO KNOW THE CREW  ON BOARD THE SOYUZ A LITTLE  MORE.  LET'S LEARN ABOUT NASA'S  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY.  IN THE RIGHT HANDS SEAT IS  NASA'S ASTRONAUT CHRISTOPHER  CASSIDY.  LECTED IN 2004, TWO SPACE  FLIGHTS AND SIX SPACE WALKS ON  HIS RESUME, A DECORATED NAVY  SKILL AND CALLS THE CITY OF  NORTH BAY HIHOME. HE WAS BORN IN 1970 IN SALEM  MASSACHUSETTS, AND ATTENDED YORK HIGH SCHOOL.  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY HOLDS  DEGREES FROM SEVERAL  INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING A  BACHELOR OF SCIENCE AND  MATHEMATICS FROM THE UNITED  STATES ACADEMY AND A MASTER OF  MOTION AND ENGINEERING FROM THE  MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF  TECHNOLOGY, HE SERVED AS A NAVY  SE FOR 11 YEARS BEFORE BEING  ELECTED AS AN ASTRONAUT.  BEING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,  AWARDED TWO BRONZE STARS AND  RECOGNITION.  HE BECAME A NAVY CAPTAIN IN 20  SH, AND NEVER -- 2014 AND NEVER  WAS ONE TO BACK DOWN TO A  CHALLENGE. N ASTRONAUT HE MADE   JOURNEY INTO SPACE ON JULY 23,  '00 THE ABORE CAPE CANNES AV RAL ABOARD THE SHUTTLE.  HE AND THE REST OF THE CREW  ASSEMBLED THE FINAL PARTS.  ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS DELIVERED AND STORED AROUND FOR FUTURE USE OP THEERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION.  AND THIS MISSION WAS A 500th  PERSON HISTORY TO FLY IN SPACE. CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY FLEW FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 2013.  AND HIS FIRST LAUNCH.  HE HAS LOGGED 182 DAYS IN SPACE  31 HOURS AND 14 MINUTES SPACE  WALKING TIME. ACK ON EARTH ME W  CHIEF ASTRONAUT AND AWARDED AN  EXCEPTIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. HE'LL TAKE OVER AS THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION NEXT WEEK, AND THE CURRENT  MISUNDERSTANDER OLEG SKRIPOCHKA  HANDS OVER THE KEY FOR THE  CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONY.  HE'S JOINED BY TWO COSMONAUTS.  ANATOLY IVANISHIN AND IVAN  VAGNER.  AND WE'LL TAKE A MOMENT TO GET  TO KNOW THEM.  WE ARE 52 MINUTES AND 35 SECONDS AWAY FROM LAUNCH. >> SEATED IN THE CAPSULE'S  SECOND SEAT IS SOYUZ MS-16  COMMANDER ANATOLY IVANISHIN.  HE IS A DECORATED RETIRED  RUSSIAN AIR FORCE COLONEL  ASSIGNED IN 2003, COMPLETING HIS TRAINING AND EXAMINATION IN  2005. HE WAS BORN IN 1969 IN RUSSIA,  LOCATE IN SIBERIA.  HE WOULD GO ON TO GRADUATE HIGH  SCHOOL IN 1986.  AND AIR FORCE PILOT SCHOOL IN  RUSSIA IN 1991.  HE HOLDS SEVERAL PILOT LICENCES  AND LOGS 550 HOURS FLYING. HIS FLIGHT MARKS THE THIRD SPACE FLIGHT OF HIS COSMO NAUGHT  CAREER, HE TRAVELLED TO SPACE IN NOVEMBER 2011 AS SPACE STATION  EXPEDITION 29 AND 30.  HE RETURNS TO THE STATION IN  SERVING AS COMMANDER ABOARD THE  FLIGHTS IN THE M.S. SERIES OF  SPACECRAFTS YOU SEE TODAY. HE HAS 2LE # 0 DAYS OF FLIGHTS  UNDER HIS BELT.  AND SEVERAL SPACE RELATED  RECOGNITIONS, INCLUDING THE 50th ANNIVERSARY, NASA SPACE FLIGHT  MET MALED AND DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE. TO THE LEFT OF ANATOLY  IVANISHIN, PREPARING FOR HIS  FIRST EVER JOURNEY INTO SPACE IS COSMO NAUGHT IVAN VAGNER. HE WAS ASSIGNED IN OCTOBER 2010  AND CERTIFIED AS A 10th COSMO  NAUGHT IN AUGUST 2012.  HE COMES FROM A TOWN LOGHT IN  THE WESTERN REGION OF RUSSIA, IN GRADUATING IN 2002 AND WENT ON  TO TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY IN ST.  PETERSBURG RUSSIA, EARNING A  MASTER OF SCIENCE IN SPACE  ROCKET SHIPS. HE HELD SEVERAL POSITIONS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY INCLUDING WORKING AS AN ENGINEER EAR.  HAVING SPENT THE PAST FEW WEE  TRAINING FOR WARES EXPEDITIONS,  HE IS LOGGING HIS OWN TOTAL TIME IN SPACE TO A FEW HOURS. >> AND THAT MUSIC THAT YOU HEAR  IS ACTIVELY PUMPED THE  SOYUZ SPACECRAFT, IT'S COMMON  FOR THE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS TO  PUMP IN THE MUSIC TO THE CREW  WHILE THEY ARE STRAPPED IN.  THEY HAVE BEEN ON BOARD THE  SOYUZ FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. AND NOW WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT  WHAT THEIR PATH WAS LIKE TO GET  THERE.  THE DAY'S ACTIVITIES IN BAIKONUR BEGAN A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, THE CREW AWAKENED 6:00p.m. CENTRAL  TIME ON APRIL 8TH.  IT WAS 4 IN THE MORNING IN  BAIKONUR.  THE CREW, CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY  THERE, WALKING OUT OF THE COSMO  NAUGHT HOTEL.  BEFORE LEAVING THEY WENT THROUGH THE TIME-HONORED TRADITIONFUL  SIGNING THE DOORS -- TRADITION  OF SIGNING THEDOORS.  THERS A LOT OF TRADITIONS  YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT AND SEE  SEVERAL OF THOSE, THE CREW  SIGNED DOORS AND DID THE WALK  OUT.  USUALLY A LOT MORE CROWDS PACKED THERE.  AGAIN, IN LIGHT OF THE SITUATION FEWER PEOPLE TO SEE THEM OFF ON  THEIR WAY.  THEYEPORTED AND BOARDED --  DEPARTED AND BOARDED A BUS FOR A 45 MINUTE DRIVE.  THE DESTINATION AT THE FACILITY, BUILDING 254 ON THE COSMO DROME  GROUNDS. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PRIEST ON THE  LEFT.  ANOTHER TRADITION. THERE TOSS THE CREWS IN THE  MORNING, TYPICALLY ONE OR TWO  DAYS BEFORE THE LAUNCH AFTER  IT'S ERECTED ON THE  . HERE WE SEE THEM ARRIVING AT  THEIR FIRST DESTINATION OF THE  DAY, THAT'S THE INTEGRATION,  BUILDING 254 ON THE COSMODRONE.  ONCE THEY GET THERE, EACH OF THE CREW MEMBER UNDER GOES A MEDICAL EXAM.  THIS IS THE SUIT YOU CAN SEE  GETTING IN HERE.  THESE ARE SUITS THAT CAN BE  PRESSURE ICED IN THE --  PRESSURISED IN THE EVENT OF  PRESSURE LOST, PROVIDING  PRESSURE, BREATHING GASES FOR  THE CREW MEMBERS, THEY ARE  ASSISTED BY A NUMBER OF SUIT  TEXTS, SOME OF THEM MORE  INTERESTING PARTS ON THE FRONT.  IT'S HOW THEY CAN ADJUST THE  PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE SUIT  ITSELF. EACH CREW MEMBER FITTED WITH A  COMCAP, A SNAPPY CAP WITH  MICROPHONES AND EAR PIECES  INSIDE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH  OTHER AND THE LAUNCH CONDUCTORS  DOWN THERE, AND ONCE IN ORBIT.  WITH THELIGHT CONTROLLER DOWN ON THE GROUND. ANATOLY IVANISHIN SUITED UP  FIRST AND JOINED BY IVAN VAGNER, MAKING A FIRST FLIGHT IN TODAY. THIS WILL BE ANATOLY IVANISHIN'S THIRD AND CHRISTOPHER    THIRD. LAST BUT NOT LEAST JOINED BY  INTO HIS SUIT. SIDY, GETTING  TAKING PLACE IN THE SUIT UP AND  INTEGRATION BUILDING ON THE  BAIKONUR COSMODRONE, THEY HAVE  THE FINAL MEDICAL EXAM, TWO  TRAINED TECHNICIANS HELP THEM  GET INTO THE GROUP.  THEY'LL WE ARE THESE FOR THE  DYNAMIC PHASES OF FLIGHT AND FOR THE SHORT DRIPS, RELATIVELY  SHORT SIX HOURS.  TWO DAYS, VERSAL YEARS AGO.  THEY'LL STAY IN THE SUITS PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE TIME DOCKING AND GETTING OUT OF THE SUITS AFTER  THEY DOCK TO THE SPACE STATIONS  AND BEFORE THEY OPEN THE  HATCHES.  HE SUT UP THEY MOVE INTO  THE NEXT ROOM, WHICH HAS PANE OF GLASS, THIS IS TYPICALLY WHERE  WE SEE CREW MEMBERS, AFTER GOING THROUGH A PRESSURE CHECK, GET A  CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH FRIENDS,  FAMILY THAT WERE ABLE TO TRAVEL  TO THE LAUNCH SITE.  AND ALSO AS PERSONNEL, WE SEE  NASA PEREL THERE, TRISHA  MACK, THE HEAD OF NASA OFFICE IN MOSCOW, CAUGHT IN ALL THE  ACTIVITIES FOR CREWS FLYING AND  RETURNING FROM THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT.  JOHN MCBRINE HELPING OUT WITH  THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE OVER THERE  AS WELL. INDIVIDUALS AT THE LAUNCH,   TYPICALLY YOU SEE A LARGER  CONTINGENT.  FAMILY, FRIENDS ABLE TO TRAVEL,  OR NOT ABLE TO DO IT TO  BAIKONUR, WITH THE TRAVEL MOSCO  FAMILY, FRIENDS ABLE TO TRAVEL,  OR NOT ABLE TO DO IT TO  BAIKONUR, WITH THE TRAVEL  RESTRICTIONS.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE,  THIS IS WHERE THEYRESSURE TEST THE SUIT.  YOU SEE IT PLUGGED IN.  THEY GET INTO A SUIT, A MOCK-UP  OF THE SOYUZ ITSELF.  ANATOLY IVANISHIN IS IN THERE,  AND HIS SUIT PUMPS UP A LITTLE  BIT.  THEY ARE PRESSURISED.  THEY ARE BREATHING GAS.  A SIMILAR COMPOSITION OF WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR ATMOSPHERE HERE ON  EARTH, FED INTO THE SUITS, AND  ABLE TOPRESSURE.  FOR ALL OF THE PHASES OF THE  FLIGHT.  ALL OF THE ASSETS, RENDEZVOUSES, AND THEY'LL BE IN THE SAME SUIT WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR WAY HOME.  AN INTERESTING NOTE ABOUT THE  SUITS, THIS IS A MOCK-UP OF THE  SUITS AND THE SEAT.  EACH OF THE CREW MEMBERS HAS A  SPECIALLY MOULDED SEAT LINER  THAT THEY SIT IN.  A VERSION OF WHAT IVAN VAGNER IS IN NOW, PLASTER MOULD IS  POURED AROUND TO CONFORM TO  THEIR BODY, AND THEY HAVE A  SPECIAL SEAT LINER, AND THAT'S  WHY EVERY CREW MEMBER AS AN  ASSIGNED SEAT.  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY IS IN THE  RIGHT SEAT TODAY.  IN THE LEFT SEAT IS THE BACK UP. AND THE CENTER SEE, SOYUZ  COMMANDER SITS.  PRIMED FOR ALL OF THE VEHICLES  OPERATIONS, MANUAL CONTROL OF  THE VEHICLE.  THEY HAVE TO TAKE OVER FOR  RENDEZVOUS AT DOCKING OR ANY  OTHER FADESES OF THE FLIGHT: ONE BY ONE THE CREW GOES THROUGH  GETTING A CHANCE TO DO THE  PRESSURE CHECKS.  WE WILL NOT SEE THE INTERACTION  THROUGH THE GLASS, THE MEDIA.  FAMILY AND INDUSTRYCIALS  WE NOT PERMITTED TO TRAVEL TO  THE LAUNCH ZONE FOR THIS, AGAIN, KEEPING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE CREW PARAMOUNT IN ALL OF THE PLANNING.  GAIN, THE INDIVIDUALS -- AGAIN,  THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE ROOM ARE  REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME  QUARANTINE AS THE CREW OR WEAR  THE P.P.E.  PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO INTERACT.  THIS IS A STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR EVERY INTERNATIONAL CREW.  IT'S HEALTH STABILIZATION.  IT'S BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS WE  HAVE BEEN DOING THE  . >> READY FOR LAUNCH, GOOD LUCK  GUYS, YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING  YOU COULD DURING YOUR ADVANTAGE, EVERYTHING IS ON BOARD. EVERYTHING WITH THE LAUNCH.  EVERYTHING WILL  LOGGED. HI, GUYS. [ CROWD NOISE ] IN SPITE EVERYTHING, YOU ARE  KEEPING YOUR COOL.  AND THERE IS NO RUSH.  SLOW AND STEADY TAKES IT. >> YOU WORKED SO HARD TO GET  HERE.  I HOPE EVERYTHING GOES  PERFECTLY, ENJOY EVERY MOMENT.  ENJOY YOUR KNEW HOME AND KNOW WE ARE ON THE GROUND.  TAKE CARE. >> I SUGGEST YOU WEAR SHOULDE  STRAPS. CREW IS READY TO WALK OUT. THEY COME OUT. THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT.  THE CREW RECORDING THATHEY ARE READY: MAINTAINING THE TRADITION ONE  FINAL TIME, DECLARING THEY ARE  READY FOR LAUNCH, AND ON THE WAY TO BUS. WAVING THERE.  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY.  THEY RIDE PAST . >> ONCE THE CREW ARRIVE, AND THE OFFICIALS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE  AGENCIES, ABLE TO LEAD THEM TO  THE FINAL STEPS BEFORE THEY MAKE THEIR WAY UP TO THE ELEVATOR,  TAKING THEM TO THE TOP OF THE  SOYUZ BOOSTER.  150 FEET TALL SITTING ON TOP OF THE PROTECTIVE LAUNCH    THEY CLIMB UP AND WAVE FOOD BUY  TO THE FINAL WELL-WISHERS,  RIDING THE ELEVATOR TO THE TOP  OF THE SOYUZ.  AS OF THIS MOMENT THEY HAVE BEEN ON BOARD FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS,  BEFORE WE CAME ON THE AIR AT  ABOUT 1:53AM, THEY WERE GETTING  READY TO GET THROUGH THE CHECK  ON THE SPACE SUITS.  THEY ARE REPORTED THAT THEY  COMPLETED THE LEAK CHECKS.  THE CREW FINISHED OFF, CLOSING  THE ADVISORS AND PRESSURIZING  THE SUITS.  WE'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF VIEWS  INSIDE THE CABIN THROUGHOUT THE  RIDE UP HILL THIS MORNING.  RIGHT NOW THE CREW, LAST TIME WE CHECKED IN, HAD THE VIZORS OPEN. WE'LL SEE THEM CLOSED BEFORE THE LAUNCH  . AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE ROAD  TO THE LAUNCH HAS BEEN ANYTHING  BUT NORMAL. IT BEGAN WITH THE COS KNOW  NAUGHTS, ANATOLY IVANISHIN AND  IVAN VAGNER, THE BACKUP CREW,  FINDING OUT THEY WERE LAUNCHING, THAT OCCURRED A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FINAL TRAINING EXAMS, WHICH  TURNED OUT TOTIMING. >> OF COURSE IT WAS A SURPRISE. WE THOUGHT WE'D FLY IN  OCTOBER 2020.  LIFE HAPPENS.  AND ANY BACK UP CREW IS READY TO BECOME PRIME.  AND SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS AT  BAIKONUR.  WE WERE LUCKY, WE HAD SOME TIME  FOR THE NEWS TO SETTLE IN. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> JUST LIKE MENTIONED.  THEY AND CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY  HAVE BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS  MISSION FOR A FEW YEARS, AND  THEY WERE PREPARED AND READY TO  FILL IN THE ROLES, EVEN UNDER  THE UNUSU CIRCUMSTANCES.  THERE WERE INCREASED HEALTH AND  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS PUT IN PLACE  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. THANKFULLY WE HAVE A ROBUST PLAN IN PLACE OF NOT TOO MUCH NEEDED  TO CHANGE WHAT THE CREW  THEMSELVES, BUT SOME OF THE  TRADITIONAL PRELAUNCH ACTIVITIES HAD TO BE RESTRUCTURED OR  REPLACED.  TO ENSURE TAT WE HAD A THOROUGH QUARANTINE POSITION FOR THE  CREW. >> IT'S BEEN INTERESTING, LIFE  FOR US IN THE PRELAUNCH PERIOD  IS ALWAYS IN QUARANTINE, I KNEW  I WAS GOING TO BE IN QUARANTINE  FOR THE TWO WEEKS.  WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS EVERYONE  AROUND US IS IN QUARANTINE TOO.  LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND  TO SEE THE IMPACTS ON THAT IN  TERMS OF WHO FROM NASA CAN COME  OVER TO SUPPORT LAUNCH, AND EACH THE RUSSIAN OPERATION ALT  SUPPORT TEAM IS SMALLER, MY  FAMILY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME. IT WILL BE A SKELETON CALL AT  THE  COSMODRONE, WHICH WILL BE QUITE  DIFFERENT.  [ ♪♪♪ ] >> WE ARE BACK AT THE LAUNCHPAD. YOU SEE THEANTRY ARMS PULLING  BACK.  PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE ROCKETS  ITSELF. ONE OF THE FINAL TASKS DOWN  THERE BEFORE WE ARE READY FOR  LAUNCH.  THE ROCKET THAT YOU ARE LOOKING  AT RIGHT NOW WENT THROUGH ALL  THE STANDARD PREPARATIONS  EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE SPACECRAFT ITSELF MADE IT TO THE BOOSTER.  IT'S ALL JOINT TOGETHER.  AND ON NDAY, THE SOYU ROCKET  BEGAN A TREK TO THE LAUNCHPAD  WHERE IT WAS RAISED TO THE  VERTICAL POSITION. FINAL PREPARATIONS, THIS IS A  VIDEO ON MONDAY.  THE SOYUZ GOING OUT FIRST FROM  THE INTEGRATION FACILITY, AND  IT'S A SHORTER PATH THAN YOU  MIGHT HAVE SEEN FROM PREVIOUS  LAUNCHES THAT WENT FROM PATH  NO.1, WE ARE USING PATH 31 THIS  TIME FROM THE FIRST TIME THE  CREW PUT IN THE CHANGE.  KIMBROUGH LAUNCHING IN  OCTOBER 2016.  ALL THIS BECAUSE WE ARE OTHE  BOOSTER.  UPGRADED VERSION OF THE SOYUZ  ROCKET.  USED TO CARRY CREW MEMBERS INTO  SPACE FOR OVER 50 YEARS.  THE SOYUZ SITTING HIGH ABOVE THE THREE STAGES OF THE BOOSTER,  WHICH USES KEROSENE.  HIGHLY REFIN VERSION OF  KEROSENE, REFERRED TO ASSESS  ROCKET FUEL.  AND LIQUID OXY ZEN AS THE PROPEL ABLE TO.  THE FIRST STAGE HAS FOUR LIQUID  ENGINES.  THE FIRST STAGES ITSELF HAS FOUR LIQUID ENGINES STRAPPED TO THE  SIDE OF THE CORE VEHICLE, EACH  ONE OF THOSE WILL BURN FOR ABOUT 1:58 SECONDS BEFORE THEY DROP  AWAY. >> AND THE CORE ENGINE ITSELF  SERVES AS THE SECOND STAGE.  WE'LL SEE THAT BURN UNTIL 4:37  INTO THE FL.  AND THE THIRD STAGE HAS SINGLE ENGINE, WE'LL SEE IT IGNITE  BEFORE IT SEPARATES FROM THE  SECOND PHASE, THEY DO SOMETHING  CALLED HOT PHASING, THERE'S A  LATTICE WORK STRUCTURE BETWEEN  THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES  ALLOWING THE EXHAUST TO EXPAND  OUT.  ATTACH TO THE SECOND STAGE, THE  THIRD STAGE WILLPO PUSH IT AWAY SALE.  THAT WILL BURN UNTIL 8:46 INTO  THE FLIGHT.  AT THAT POINT THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT WILL SEPARATE FROM  THE THIRD STAGE, AND IT WILL BE  IN THE PRELIMINARY ORBIT. AS MENTIONED AT THE START OF THE SHOW, WE SAID WE'D GET TO YOUR  QUESTIONS, WE'LL GO THROUGH SOME NOW.  IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE  LAUNCH, DOCKING OR HATCH  OPENING.  SEND IT IN ON TWITTER USING  HASHTAG-NASA.  THIS ONE, AT WHAT TIME AFTER THE LAUNCH WILL THE LCH BE  EJECTED. >> IT'S 1:54 SECONDS INTO THE  FLIGHT.  THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PIECE OF THE LAUNCH SYSTEM.  THERE ARE SOLID ROCKET MOTORS ON THE CAPSULE BEARING ITSELF, THAT CAN BE USED AFTER THE TOURS  JETTISON.  JUST DON'T PULL THE VEHICLE AW.  THEY WERE USED ON OCTOBER 11TH,  WHEN THE M.S.U. SPACE GRAFT  QUARRYING OLEXY AND ANOTHEREN  COUNTERED A LAUNCH ESCAPE.  1:54 SECOND, TO ANSWER YOUR  QUESTION. >> THE NEXT ONE COMES FROM SI,  WANTING TO KNOW IF THE STATION CREW GET TO EP THEIR PHONES ON THE I.S.S. THEY DON'T BRING THE PHONE WITH  THEM.  YOUR CELL PHONE RELIES ON GROUND STATION TOWERS TO COMMUNICATE.  THEY ARE A LITTLE TOO HIGH UP  FOR THOSE TO WORK.  THEY DO HAVE, BASICALLY, VOICE  OVER IP PHONES, SO A PHONE THAT  USES DATA, USING THE DATA  STREAMS THATEND TELEMETRY  DATA, VIDEO, EVERYTHING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND ARE ABLE TO CALL PEOPLE FROM  EARTH.  IT WORKS LIKE VOICE OVER IP.  AND THEY CAN DIAL CELL PHONE  NUMBERS HERE ON EARTH, AND THEY  CAN CALL YOU FROM SPACE. AND WE WILL GET TO A LITTLE BIT  MORE A LITTLE LATER IN TODAY'S  LAUNCH.  FOR NOW, LET'S KEEP ON GOING  THROUGH.  LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT WHICH WE WILL SEE IN  SPACE WHEN IT ARRIVES AT THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACEATION.  GOING THROUGH QUICK FACTS.  SOYUZ 23.5 FEET LONG, WEIGHING  IN 15,615 POUNDS, COMPRISED OF  THREE DIFFERENT MODULES. THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE  DESCENT MODULE.  CONTAINING THE SEATS CONTROLS  AND SPLAYS NECESSARY FOR THE --  DISPLACE NECES FORHE  FLIGHT SHOULD THE CREW TAKE  CONTROL AND FLY. GIVING YOU IN TIGHT INTO THE  SYSTEMS ON THE SPACECRAFT AND  THE ROCKET.  AND ALL THE LIFE SUPPORT  SYSTEMS, BATSRIES FOR  RE-ENTRY -- BATTERIES FOR  RE-ENTRY AND LANDING, AND USED  TO SLOW THE SOYUZ BEFORE TOUCH  DOWN, WHEN THEY LAND IN  KAZAKHSTAN.  THE MODULE WEIGHS 6,393 POUNDS.  AND CAN CARRY 110 POUNDS OF  PAYLOAD RETURNED DOWN TO EARTH  WITH THE MODULE. BRINGING YOU DOWN SAMPLES,  THINGS LIKE THAT WITH THE CREW  WHEN THEY RETURN, AND THAT IS  MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ONLY  PORTION OF THE SOYUZ THAT HAS  HEAT SHIELDS, SO IT'S ABLE TO  SURVIVE THE FIERY RE-ENTRY  THROUGHRTH'S ATMOSPHERE.  THE ORBITAL MODULES ON TOP  CONNECTING TO THE DISSENT  MODULE.  THERE'S A HATCHWAY BETWEEN IF  AND THE DISSENT MODULE.  IT HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF ROOM  INSIDE THAT THEY CAN MOVE  AROUND. ON THE TOP IT HAS THE DOCKING  MECHANISM.  THE HATCH AND RENDEZVOUS  ANTENNAS. AND THERE'S A FORWARD-LOOKING  WIND THAT THEY SCAN LOOK OUT.  THEY TAKE MANUAL MEASUREMENTS AS AN APPROACH TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THEY CAN USE A LASER RANGE  FINDER IN THE EVENT THEY HAVE  ISSUES.  ON THE BOTTOM IS THE PROPULSION  OF THE IMPLEMENTATION MODULE.  IT HAS OXYGEN TANKS,  COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL  EQUIPMENT PROPULSION PORTION OF  THE MODULE HANDLES ALL THE  ORBITAL MANOEUVRES, IT HAS  ENGINES NEEDED FOR THE  RENDEZVOUS AT THE SPACE STATION, AND A BURN AT THE ENDS OF THE  MISSION.  BEFORE THEY ARE DEPLOYED.  THERE ARE TWO SOLAR ARRAYS  GIVING A WIND SPAN OF 35 FEET.  THEY ARE FOLDED AGAINST THE BODY OF THE MODULE. ONCE WE GET INTO SPACE, WE'LL  SEE THEM UNFURL AND PROVIDE  ELECTRO POWER TO THE STATION'S  SYSTEMS. BOTH THE PROPULSION MODULE AND  THE ORBITAL MODULE SEPARATE FROM THE DISSENT IMMEDIATUAL AT THE  END OF A MISSION AND ONE UP IN  THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.  THE SPACECRAFT SEARCHING AS A  TRANSPORT VEHICLE TO AND FROM  THE SPACE STATION AND ACTS AS AN EMERGENCY RETURN VEHICLE, SHOULD THE CREW NEED TO LEAVE  UNEXPECTEDLY.  FOR EVERY CREW MEMBER ON BOARD  THERE'S A SEAT IN A SPACECRAFT  FOR THEM DOCKED TO THE SPACE  STATION. >> JUST CHECKING IN, WE ARE  22:20 SECONDS TO THE LAUNCH.  THE CREW CONDUCTED SUIT LEAK  CHECKS.  THEY ARE STANDING BY AT THIS  POINT UNTIL WE GET TO THE LAUNCH POINT.  CREW GOING THROUGH ALLE  PRELAUNCH PROCEDURES INSIDE THE  CAPSULE, STILL CONTINUING ON  WITH THIS COUNTDOWN FOR TODAY. ONCE THEY LEAVE THE EARTH'S  ATMOSPHERE, A LITTLE LATER THIS  MORNING, THIS IS GOING TO BET  THIRD TRIP INTO SPACE FOR NASA'S CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY.  AND BEFORE HEADING BACK INTO  ORBIT.  HE SPENT A MOMENT SHARING WITH US THE SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE THAT  HE'S BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, THE PLACE THAT HE'S SOON GOING TO  CALL HOME ONCE AGAIN. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> THE SPACE STATION IS BIGGER  THAN YOU THINK.  WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE YOU ARE  GOING LIVE IN THE SPACE STATION  PEOPLE THING OF CRAMPED PLACES,  CRAMPED SDERS WHEN YOUALK  THROUGH. IT'S BIG, AND YOU CAN STAND AND  IN A WHOLE DAY NEVER SEE A CREW  MATE.  THE OTHER THING PEOPLE DON'T  REALIZE IS THE MACHINE, JUST  LIKE YOUR CAR OR HOUSE. OR YOUR AIRCONDITIONER IS GOING  TO BREAK.  THEY MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN NASA  HAS SOMETHING THAT WILL BREAK IN SPACISM IT'S A MACHINE, IT WILL  BREAK, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO  DO, KEEP IT RUNNING. END OF THE DAY, THERE'S SEVERAL  THINGS THAT REQUIRES A PERSON TO TURN AROUND. ON MY FIRST MISSION, I WAS A  SHUTTLE CREW MEMBER, MY SECOND  MISSION T WE ARE PUSHING THE  SCIENCE SYSTEMS OF THE SPACE  STATION, AND GETTING THE MOST  OUT OF THE ALL OF THE ASSETS  THAT THE SPACE STATION HAS TO  GIVE FOR SCIENCE AND RESEARCH,  NOW WE ARE HUMMING ALONGITH  THE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH.  THE GREATER COMMUNITY KNOWS HOW  TO RUN THE SPACE STATION SO WE  CAN DEVOTE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ASTRONAUTS TO SCIENCE. THE ANNIVERSARY IS SPECIAL TO ME IN THE SENSE THAT BILL SHEPHERD  WAS THE COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION  1, UNITED STATES NAVY SEAL. AND I'LL BE THE COMMANDER OF  EXPEDITION 63, 20 YEARS LATER.  UNITED STATES NAVY SEAL. SO THERE HAS BEEN THREE OF US  SHEP, MYSELF AND JOHNNY, WHO  HAVE COME FROM THE SEAL  COMMANDERS.   I THINK IT'S COOL THAT IT'S THE BOOKENDS OF THE 20 YEARS OF  STATIONS IS COMMANDED BY SHEP  AND MYSELF. WHAT AM I LOOKING FORWARD TO  MOST ON THIS MISSION? THIS IS M THIRD ONE. I'M GOING INTO IT WITH THE  MINDSET I'LL CHERISH EVERY DAY  I'M THERE, IT MAY BE THE LAST  DAY I GET TO LOOK OUT THE WIND  AND SEE EARTH. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO  APPRECIATING EVERY ONE OF  THOSE DAYS. I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO  EARTH TO BE WITH MY FAMILY, BUT  I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO  THAT, EACF THOSE DAYS.  I'M ASTRONAUT CHRISTOPHER  CASSIDY, THANKS FOR BEING PART  OF EXPEDITION 63. >> BACK NOW WITH A LIVE VIEW OF  THE SOYUZ ROCKET.  REITERATING THE FINAL SCENE  THERE, IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW  SCPRIS HIS MISSION, HE'S --  CHRIS AND HIS MISSION, HE'S  SPENDING SIX MONTHS, FOLLOW HIM  AT INSTAGRAM, HE'S AT  ASTRO-_SEAL.  A QUICK CHECK IN.  WE ARE 17:40 SECONDS AWAY FROM  THE LAUNCH. TAKE A COUPLE MORE MINUTES NOW,  AND ANSWER A FEW MORE OF YOUR  ASK NASA QUESTIONS.  IF YOU HAVE ANY USE THE HASHTAG  ASK NASA, SEND IN AND WE'LL GO  THROUGH THEM. WE HAVE ONE FROM ANDREW BORDER  WHO ASKS A QUESTION ABOUT THE TRAINING THEY'VE GONE THROUGH,  HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN WAITING  FOR THIS DAY.  AND HOW MUCH THRUST HAS THE  ROCKET LET OUT.  CREWS FOR THE SPACE STATION  TRAIN FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS,  THAT'S TO GET FAMILIARISATION ON ALL OF THE SYSTEMS ON BOARD THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,  THAT THEY'LL INTERACT WITH,  FIXING IT, WORKING ON  EXPERIMENTS, THEY ARE DOING  SPACE WALKS, THERE'S A LOT OF  KNOWLEDGE TO GATHER AND TRAIN,  AND IT TAKES TWO YEARS TO DO  THAT.  THEY ARE GOING THROUGH  SPACECRAFT SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR THE CREWS, THEY HAD TO TRAIN ON  THE SOYUZ SYSTEMS, BE ABLE TO  RESPOND IN THE EVENT OF AN  EMERGENCY, FLY THE VEHICLE IF  YOU ARE THE COMMANDER OR THE  BACK UP.  AND THEY DO FINAL EXAMS,T'S  LIKE TO COLLEGE FOR A LOT OF THE CREW MEMBERS, IT'S  ABOUT TWO YEARS OF TRAINING, AND HOW MUCH THRUST DOES THE ROCKET  LET OUT IN THE FIRST STAGE,  DELIVERS ABOUT 930,000 POUNDS OF THRUST. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> AND THEN THE NEXT ONE COMES  FROM ROBERT GRUZMAN, ARRIVING  WHEN THE ASTRONAUTS COME BACK TO EARTH IS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM  WEAKENED BY A STAY IN SPACE. IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION AND IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE A  LOT OF STUDIES TAKING PLACE.  THE HUMAN BODY ADAPTS QUICKLY TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS, IT'S A  BLESSING AND A CURSE FOR STUFF  LIKE SPACE FLIGHT.  STARTS TO AFFECT A LOT OF THINGS LIKE PHONES, MUSCLES AND IMMUNE  SYSTEMS IN THE ASTRONAUTS.  WE SEE THAT IT CAN AFFECT YOUR  IMMUNE SYSTEM.  IT CAN WEAKEN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM A LITTLE BIT.  AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY  THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO  UNDERSTAND AS WE LOOK TO NOT  ONLY SEND HUMANS FURTHER THAN WE HAVE EVER GONE BEFORE, GOING  FORWARD TO THE MOON AND  EVENTUALLY ON TO MARS, TO  KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.  WHEN THEY ARE IN SPACE, BUT ALSO VERY IMPORTANTLY, WHEN THEY COME HOME.  WE HAVE FOUND THAT A LOT OF  STUFF THAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY  WHEN YOU ARE ON THE SPACE  STATION HAS A LOT OF PARALLELS  FOR AILMENTS HERE ON EARTH.  A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BODY, LIKE BONE WASTING AND MUSCLE LOSS AND THING OF THAT NATURE. MIMIC A LOT OF THE EFFECTS OF  AGEING, SO WE ARE ABLE TO USE  THE ASTRONAUTS, AND WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHILE THEY ARE  IN OUTER SPACE, HOW TO GUEST  TAKE CARE OF THEM, A LOT OF  THOSE LESSONS CAN TRANSLATE TO  MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR HUMANS ON THE GROUND.  WE ARE GOING TO KEEP MOVING ON.  SEND THE QUESTIONS IN, WE'LL DO  A LUNCH LATER TODAY WHEN WE GET  TO THE DOCKING SHOW.  USE THE HASHTAG ASK NASA.  AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE  OF TIMES, SPACE FLIGHT ALL ABOUT TRADITIONS, IN KEEPING WITH  THAT, EVERY MISSION, LIKE EVERY  NASA PROGRAMME, EVERY CREW, HAS GIVE THEIR OWN PATCH WITH THE  UNIQUE DESIGN THAT HELPS TO  COMMEMORATE THEIR MISSION AND  CREW MEMBERS, AND THIS IS A LOOK AT THE EXPEDITION 63 PATCH.  IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF MIF  FAVOURITES.  IT'S COOL INTERESTING LOOKING  ONE, AN INTERSECTION OF A NEW  DAWN AND SPACEIGHT.  WE CONTINUE TO STAY ON BOARD THE STATION, WE ARE ABOUT TO  COMMEMORATE 20 YEARS OF  CONTINUOUS FLIGHT.  BUT LOOK AT PUTTING HUMANS ONCE  MORE ON THE MOON, AND GETTING  READY TO NOT TOO FAR AFTER, HEAD ON TO MARS.  13 OF THE STARS IN THE PATCH  COMMEMORATE THE APOLLO 13th. CELEBRATING A 50th ANNIVERSARY  DURING EXPEDITION 63.  AND THE PUSH, TEACHER MISSION  THAT WILL GO BEYOND LOW EARTH  ORBIT AGAIN.  AND THE CREW CALL SIGN ORBITING  AROUND A NUKE LEE US, IN THEIR  CASE PLANET EARTH.  AND ANO TRADITI THAT THE  ASTRONAUTS AND COSMONAUTS LIKE  TO TAKE PART THIS IS A 0-G  INDICATOR, WE'LL SEE IT FLOATING ABOVE THE SECOND SEAT.  SOMETIMES EACH CREW MEMBER HAS  THEIR OWN.  TOLY IS TAKE BS -- ANATOLY  ANA  IVANISHIN IS TAKING A TOY, A  SIGNIFICANT GIFT FOR HIS GLAIND  ONE DAY.  THAT WILL HANG INSIDE THE SOYUZ  CAPSULE WHEN WE GET THE IN-CABIN VIEWS, IT'S A 0-G INDICATOR, AND WE USE IT WHEN YOU START TO SEE  THAT FLOAT, AND THAT HAPPENS  AFTER THEY GET TO THE THIRD  STAGE, THEY ARE EXPOSED TO  MICROGRAVITY, THEMSELVES,  STRAPPED INTO THE SEATS, THEY'LL NOT BE FLOATING AROUND JUST YET. ANOTHER SYSTEM COLLECT IN, WE  ARE NOT TRACKING ANY ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE, WE  12:25  COUNTING AWAY FROM    ALL RIGHT.  WE ARE GETTING CLOSER, 11.5 AWAY FROM LAUNCH, ALL TOLD. IT WILL BE UNDER A 9 MINUTE RIDE TO ORBIT FOR THE CREW.  THEY'LL BE LAUNCHING AT  3:05:00a.m. CENTRAL TIME  4:05a.m. EASTERN.  WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR A NUMBER OF MILESTONES THE RIDE UPHILL.  ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR ONES IS  THE LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM  JETTISON, COMING 1:54 INTO THE  FLIGHT.  THE FIRST STAGE CUTS OFF AND  SEPARATES THE FOUR STRAP-ON  LIQUID FUEL BOOSTERS AT 1:58.  AFTER THAT IS IT DOWN, THE  LH ROUTE, THE AREA ON TOP,  PROTECTING THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT  FROM AERODYNAMIC FORCES ON THE  RIGHT SEPARATES AT 2:33 SECONDS  INTO FLIGHT.  THE SECOND STAGE WILL SHUT DOWN  AT 4:37 SECONDS.  SEPARATING AT 4:48 SECONDS AS  THAT HAPPENS, THE THIRD STAGE WILL FIRING, DOING A HOT  FIRE TECHNIQUE, AND WE GET A  CLOSE UP AND YOU SEE THE LATTICE WORK-LIKE STRUCTURE BETWEEN THE  SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF THE  SOYUZ SPACECRAFT.  ALLOWING THE ENGINE TO FIRE  WHILE THEY ARE ATTACHED.  THE THIRD STAGE COMING AT 4:56.  AND THE FINAL THING THE'LL  LOOK FORS GOING TO BE THE  THIRD STAGE SHUTDOWN. >> LAUNCH LEAD.

AND GETTING REMINDERS TO  DEACTIVATE THERMAL SES ON  THELF, AND GETTING  READY TO DEACTIVATE THE PROBE  AND GOING A HAND CONTROLLER  TEST.  ABLE TO CONTROL THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT ITSELF. IF WE GO FOR THE NOMINAL PLAN  EVERYTHING WILL BE DONE  AUTOMATED. RENDEZVOUS AND DOCKING SYSTEM.  THAT WAS CONFIRMED TO HAVE  SEPARATED FROM THE SOYUZ ROCKET, ALONG WITH THE SOLAR ARRAYS. STANDING BY FOR A FEW MOMENTS  FOR THE LAUNCH REPLAY, WE SHOULD BE BRINGING THEM TO YOU SHORTLY. AND HERE WE GO, SHE IS ARE  REPLAYS -- THESE ARE REPLAY, THE LAUNCH ON TIME 3:05 CENTRAL.  4:05:00 EASTERN.  SOYUZ M.S.-16 SPACE -- SOYUZ  MS-16 TAKING OFF.  THE REPLAYS WILL CYCLE THROUGH A FEW DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE  ROCKET   >> AND ANOTHER REPLAY, WE'LL  STAND BY, WE SHOULD HAVE AT  LEAST ONE MORE REPLAY OF THE  LAUNCH, COMING ON TIME AT  3:05a.m. CENTRAL. 25 MINUTES AGO.  STAND BY.  WE GET CONFIRMATION OF THE  DOCKING PROBE.  SO THAT EXTENDS FROM THE VERY  TOP OF THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT OUT  OF THE ORBITAL MODULE.  USED TO DO THE FINAL ALIGNMENT  INTO THE DOCKING COMPARTMENT ON  THE POLICE MODULE WHERE THEY'LL  BE HEADED TODAY. THAT WAS EXTENDED SUCCESSFULLY  FOR ALL THE HONORARY CHECKOUTS  CONTINUING TO GO PER PLAN.  AND SHOULD BE INNED 20 MINUTES  AWAY -- BE UNDER 20 MINUTES AWAY FROM ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR  FIRINGS OF THE ENGINE, ON THE  IMPLEMENTATION MODULE.  KNOWN AS THE NO.1 BURN.  AND THAT WILL BE THE FIRST IN A  SERIES OF FIRINGS THAT GRADULY SE THE SOYUZ'S ORBIT UNTIL  IT'S ON THE SAME LEVEL OF THE  SPACE STATION. AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 257 STATUTE MILES. HERE WE GO, ONE MORE LAUNCH  REPLAY FROM JUST ABOUT   26 MINUTES AGO.  SOYUZ LAUNCH - LOOKED LIKE A  PERFECT LAUNCH, AND EVERYWHERE - WE HAVE A  . ALL RIGHT.  THAT WILL DO IT FORUR REPLAYS \n  WHILE WE GO INTO THE THIRD ONE,  WE HAD A CALL FROM THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,  ANDREW MORGAN, A CURRENTS  RESIDENT.  REPORTED THAT THEY WATCHED THE  LAUNCH, AND WITH EVERYTHING  LOOKING GOOD THEY ARE READY TO  RECEIVE THE CREW MEMBERS, AND  MENTIONED HE'LL HAVE DINNER  WAITING FOR THEM.  HE AND JESSICA MEIR AND OLEG  SKRIPOCHKA COMING OUT OF THE  SLEEP PERIOD.  THIS IS BRIGHT AND EARLY IN THE  MORNING FOR THEM.  IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW THEY'LL  HAVE THREE NEW CREW MEMBERS THAT THEY'LL WELCOME ON BOARD. WITH THAT, WE'LL TAKE A BREAK  FOR NOW.  WHILE THE SOYUZ FINE  TUPS  ITS -- FINE TUNE ITS PATH. WE'LL BE BACK FOR LIVE COVERAGE  ONCE WE ARE HERE AND READY FOR  DOCKING, ON NASSA TV WE'LL --  NASA TV WE'LL DO A VIDEO FILE. ALL THE LAUNCH, AND BE BACK WITH THE LIVE COVERAGE AT 8:30AM  CENTRAL.  9:30 STERN.  OR A PLANNED DOCKING AT 9:16AM. AFTER A DOCKS, A SERIES OF  CHECKS, AND READY TO OPEN THE  HATCHES AND MOVE INTO THE  STATION, WE'LL BEGIN AT 11AM  CENTRAL.  HATCH OPENING AROUND 11:30a.m..  AND WRAP UP THE COVERAGE WITH A  VIDEO FILE SHOWING ALL OF THE  HIGHLIGHTS FROM DING,ND THE HATCH OPENING AT 2:00p.m.  CENTRAL.  3:00p.m. EASTERN.  SO BE SURE TO TUNE BACK IN THEN. KEEP SENDING THE QUESTIONS USING THE HASHTAG ASK NASA ON TWITTER, WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO  ANSWER THOSE AS WE MOVE THROUGH  THE DOCKING AND HATCH OPENING  LATER THIS MORNING.  I DO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR  STNG UP LATE OR WAKING UP  EARLY TO TUNE IN TO WATCH THE  LAUNCH.  IT'S A ROUGH TIME FOR  EVERYWHERE, WE APPRECIATE IT.  WITH THAT WE'LL SIGN OFF AND BE  BACK IN A FEW HOURS, THIS IS  MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON.  d\nbad luck from the very\nbeginning. 13, we have one more item for\nyou when you get a chance - we'd\nlike you to stir up your\ncryotanks. It never really converged to the\npoint where you felt you really had\ntotal control of what was going\non. OK, Houston, we have a problem\nhere.

89,,Restored Apollo 11 Moonwalk - Original NASA EVA Mission Video - Walking on the Moon,"Original Mission Video as aired in July 1969 depicting the Apollo 11 astronauts conducting several tasks during extravehicular activity (EVA) operations on the surface of the moon.  The EVA lasted approximately 2.5 hours with all scientific activities being completed satisfactorily.  The Apollo 11 (EVA) began at 10:39:33 p.m. EDT on July 20, 1969 when Astronaut Neil Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft first. While descending, he released the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly on the Lunar Module's descent stage. A camera on this module provided live television coverage of man's first step on the Moon. On this, their one and only EVA, the astronauts had a great deal to do in a short time. During this first visit to the Moon, the astronauts remained within about 100 meters of the lunar module, collected about 47 pounds of samples, and deployed four experiments.

WE AS NEW  YORKERS, WE TEND  TO THINK ABOUT  BIG DREAMS, HAVE  BIG PLANS AND DO  THINGS WITH A LOT OF ENERGY. AS NEW YORKERS,  WE PUT OUR ALL  INTO EVERYTHING. YOU CERTAINLY  HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE WAY THAT ALL  OF YOU HAVE  FOUGHT BACK THIS  VIRUS. IT\'S BEEN  OUTSTANDING AND  I\'M VERY, VERY  PROUD OF THE  PEOPLE IN THIS  CITY. JUST LIKE WE DO  EVERYTHING IN A  BIG, BOLD WAY IN  NORMAL TIMES,  PEOPLE HAVE  FOUGHT BACK WITH  ALL THEY\'VE GOT  IN THIS TIME, AND THAT\'S WHY WE\'RE  PUSHING BACK THIS DISEASE MORE  EVERY DAY. NOW, IT WOULD BE  NATURAL FOR NEW  YORKERS TO WANT A BIG, FAST, BOLD  RESTART. IT\'S NATURAL FOR  US TO WANT TO GET BACK ON OUR FEET  AS QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE. WE ARE NOT A  PATIENT PEOPLE,  AND THAT IS IN  MANY WAYS PART OF WHAT MAKES US  GREAT. BUT THIS IS A  TIME WHERE WE  NEED TO START  APPRECIATING  WHAT\'S GOOD ABOUT THE WORD  MODERATION,  BECAUSE FOR US TO GET TO WHERE WE  NEED TO GO, FOR  US TO GET TO THAT BIG, STRONG  RESTART, AND TO  GET TO RECOVERY,  WHICH I KNOW WE  CAN ACHIEVE, WE  HAVE TO DO THIS  THE SMART WAY. THIS IS A CASE  WHERE A LITTLE  MODERATION I  THINK WOULD BE  GOOD FOR ALL OF  US. ONE STEP AT A  TIME AND LET\'S  GET IT RIGHT. SO THERE\'S NO  ON-OFF SWITCH  HERE. THIS HAS TO BE  DONE IN STAGES. IT HAS TO BE DONE GRADUALLY. THAT DOESN\'T MEAN DOING IT ANY  SLOWER THAN IT  NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT MEANS DOING IT WHEN IT\'S THE  RIGHT TIME TO  OPEN UP, WE DO  IT. WHEN WE PROVE  IT\'S WORKING, WE  TAKE THE NEXT  STEP, THE NEXT  STEP. AND THERE\'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE  WILL ANSWER AS  PART OF THIS  PROCESS, AND  WE\'RE GOING TO  COME TO  DECISIONS, SHARE  THEM WITH ALL OF  YOU AND TOGETHER  WE\'RE GOING TO  MAKE THEM WORK. SO FOR EXAMPLE,  WHAT KIND OF  PERSONAL  PROTECTIVE  EQUIPMENT WILL  PEOPLE NEED IN  EACH INDUSTRY, IN EACH PART OF OUR  ECONOMY, AS THEY  OPEN UP. THEY WANT TO BE  VERY SPECIFIC  ABOUT WHAT WILL  PROTECT BOTH THE  FOLKS WHO WORK IN EACH INDUSTRY AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE TO BE  VERY CLEAR ABOUT  HOW WE\'RE GOING  TO USE  TEMPERATURE  CHECKS, BECAUSE  THIS WILL BE AN  IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUATION. BUT HOW WE\'RE  GOING TO USE  THEM, WHERE WE\'RE GOING TO USE  THEM, MAKING SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH  THERMOMETERS,  WE\'RE PLANNING  RIGHT NOW AND THE DETAILS WE\'LL BE  ANNOUNCING. HOW DO WE MAKE  SURE CLEANING IS  HANDLED THE RIGHT WAY? IT WILL BE  DIFFERENT  DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF WORK  WE\'RE TALKING  ABOUT, BUT WE  WANT TO BE CLEAR  AND TRANSPARENT  WHAT KIND OF  CLEANING WILL BE  NECESSARY TO  SUSTAIN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT GOING FORWARD AND KEEP  EVERYONE SAFE. AND WHEN SOMEONE  TESTS POSITIVE,  WHAT HAPPENS  NEXT? WELL, WE ALL KNOW AND WE\'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT IT  FOR WEEKS NOW,  AND YOU\'RE ABOUT  TO SEE IT COME  ALIVE, THE TEST  AND TRACE  INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT IDENTIFYING PEOPLE, TRACING  CONTACTS AND  MAKING SURE  EVERYONE WHO  NEEDS TO BE  ISOLATED IS  ISOLATED,  EVERYONE WHO  NEEDS TO BE  QUARANTINED THE  QUARANTINED. WE WANT TO BE  CLEAR HOW THAT  WORKS RIGHT DOWN  TO THE POINT  WHERE SOMEONE  SHOWS UP AT WORK  AND AT THAT  MOMENT FINDS OUT  THEY\'VE GOT A  POSITIVE TEST,  WHAT DO THEY DO  THEN? IF THEY FIND OUT  THE NIGHT BEFORE, WHAT DO THEY DO? WE\'RE GOING TO  LAY IT OUT SO  PEOPLE KNOW  EXACTLY HOW TO  HANDLE EACH  SCENARIO. NOW, WE ALREADY  KNOW A LOT FROM  THE SCIENCE, EVEN THOUGH NO ONE  KNOWS EVERYTHING  ABOUT THIS  DISEASE. WE KNOW A LOT  FROM THE MEDICAL  COMMUNITY. WE KNOW A LOT  ABOUT WHAT HAS  BEEN WORKING AND  NOT WORKING IN  OTHER PLACES OF  THE WORLD. WE\'RE GOING TO  TAKE THE GOOD  MODELS AND ADAPT  THEM TO WHAT WE  DO HERE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW  THERE\'S NO PLACE  LIKE NEW YORK  CITY, AND WE KNOW THAT WE AS A CITY GOVERNMENT, WE  CAN TAKE ALL THE  BEST INFORMATION  AND COME UP WITH  THE RIGHT GAME  PLAN, BUT WE NEED TO ALWAYS RUN IT  BY THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO THE  WORK, THE PEOPLE  IN EACH BUSINESS, THE PEOPLE IN  EACH SECTOR OF  OUR LIFE IN THIS  CITY AND OUR  ECONOMY WHO  UNDERSTAND THE  DAY-TO-DAY LIFE  OF THEIR  WORKPLACES BEST  AND CAN GIVE US  REAL WORLD ADVICE ABOUT WHAT\'S  GOING TO WORK,  WHAT\'S NOT GOING  TO WORK, WHAT  QUESTIONS THEY  NEED ANSWERED. WE WANT TO HELP  EACH BUSINESS  BACK ON THEIR  FEET AS QUICKLY  AS POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT, WE  HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ANSWER  THEIR QUESTIONS  AND HEAR THEIR  VIEW OF WHAT THEY NEED. SO WE ARE  BRINGING TOGETHER WHAT WE CALL  SECTOR ADVISORY  COUNCILS FROM  DIFFERENT PARTS  OF THIS CITY,  BOTH IN TERMS OF  DIFFERENT PAR  OF O ECONOMY,  BUT ALSO PEOPLE  THAT REPRESENT  ALL OF US, ALL  THE DIFFERENT  NEIGHBORHOODS,  PEOPLE OF ALL  BACKGROUNDS,  PEOPLE WITH  DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVES, TO  HELP US  UNDERSTAND WHAT  IS NEEDED TO GET  THIS RESTART  RIGHT. AND IT\'S VERY,  VERY IMPORTANT  THAT WE THINK  ABOUT EVERYTHING  THAT MAKES UP  LIFE IN THIS  CITY. SO WE\'RE NAMING A GROUP OF  DIFFERENT  COUNCILS. WE\'RE GOING TO  START WITH A  GROUP OF PEOPLE  THAT I AM  APPOINTING TO  EACH. WE THINK OTHERS  NEED TO BE NAMED, WE WILL. AND IF WE THINK  ANY OTHER GROUP  HAS TO BE FORMED, WE CAN DO THAT  OBVIOUSLY AT ANY  POINT. BUT I THINK THIS  INITIAL GROUP  GIVES US A GOOD  START ON THE  THINGS WE HAVE TO WORK ON RIGHT  AWAY. SO TODAY WE ARE  GOING TO ROLL OUT SIX COUNCILS, AND THEN THERE WILL  BE FOUR MORE ON  THE WAY AFTER  THAT. THE FIRST OF  THESE WILL MEET  TOMORROW. ALL THE OTHERS  WILL BE MEETING  IN THE NEXT FEW  DAYS. BY NEXT WEEK,  EVERYONE WILL  HAVE HAD THEIR  INITIAL MEETING  AND WE\'LL BE UP  AND RUNNING. AND THEIR  QUESTIONS, THEIR  INPUT, ARE GOING  TO BE USED  IMMEDIATELY IN  OUR RESTART  PLANNING AND THEN CONTINUE ON AS WE MOVE AHEAD  TOWARDS RECOVERY. EACH GROUP WILL  HAVE BETWEEN 20  AND 40 MEMBERS. EACH GROUP WILL  BE LED BY ONE OR  TWO DEPUTY MAYORS AND HEADS OF  DIFFERENT CITY  AGENCIES GIVING  THEIR INPUT. WE\'LL ROLL OUT  TODAY THE NAMES  OF THE FIRST SIX  COUNCILS AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL  FOUR AS QUICKLY  AS POSSIBLE. AND I\'M GOING TO  GIVE YOU SOME  EXAMPLES OF  COUNCILS WE\'RE  BRINGING TOGETHER THAT ARE  PARTICULARLY  CRUCIAL FOR THE  RESTART. SO SMALL  BUSINESS. THIS ADVISORY  COUNCIL WILL BE  LED BY OUR DEPUTY MAYORS VICKY BEAM AND PHIL  THOMPSON. SMALL BUSINESS IS REALLY TAKING ON  THE CHANGE AND  I\'M GLAD THERE\'S  BEEN A ROBUST  FEDERAL AID  PROGRAM, WE NEED  TO MAKE THE  PROGRAM WORK A  LOT BETTER. WE\'RE PUSHING  HARD. WE NEED TO MAKE  SURE EVERY SINGLE SMALL BUSINESS  CAN TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF IT  DOES. WE ALSO HAVE TO  THINK ABOUT THE  SHEER MECHANICS  OF HOW THIS  RESTART CAN WORK  BEST FOR SMALL  BUSINESS. A LOT OF SMALL  BUSINESSES ARE  VERY WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  COMEBACK. A LOT OBVIOUSLY  HAVE MUCH LESS IN THE WAY OF  RESOURCES. SMALL BUSINESS  OWNERS POUR THEIR HEART AND SOUL  INTO THEIR SMALL  BUSINESS. THERE\'S NOTHING  MORE PERSONAL  THAN CREATING A  SMALL BUSINESS,  MAKING IT WORK,  MAKING IT AN  ASSET TO YOUR  COMMUNITY AND  NEIGHBORHOOD TO  THIS WHOLE CITY. IT\'S NEVER EASY  AND, ON TOP OF  THAT, WITH ALL  THE STRUGGLES ANY SMALL BUSINESS  GOES THROUGH, AND THEY\'RE GOING  THROUGH A LOT OF  STRUGGLES BEFORE  THIS CRISIS HITS. WE TALKED ABOUT  IT A LOT IN MY  STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS. NOW ON TOP OF  THIS PANDEMIC,  WHICH IS CREATING MORE UNCERTAINTY. SO WE ARE GOING  TO LISTEN, WE\'RE  GOING TO COME UP  WITH PLANS THAT  WILL HELP SMALL  BUSINESSES BACK  ON THEIR FEET. WE NEED THEM. WE NEED THEM  BECAUSE OF THE  HEART AND SOUL OF OUR CITY. WE NEED THEM  BECAUSE THEY\'RE  WHAT MAKE NEW  YORK CITY GREAT. WE NEED THEM  BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHERE A HUGE  PERCENTAGE OF  EMPLOYMENT IS IN  THIS CITY. WE NEED  EVERYTHING. WE NEED OUR  BODEGAS AND  CORNER STORES,  OUR BARS AND  RESTAURANTS, OUR  STARTUPS THAT ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR  ECONOMY. YOU NAME IT, WE  NEED THEM ALL. SO THIS GROUP  WILL BE IDEA  GENERATORS,  INNOVATORS TO  HELP US FIGURE  OUT THE NEXT  STEPS. OBVIOUSLY THIS  CITY HAS A HUGE  NUMBER OF LARGER  BUSINESSES AS  WELL AND WE  DEPEND ON THEM  DEEPLY. THE LARGER  BUSINESSES WILL  BE CRUCIAL TO  JUMP STARTING OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND WE\'RE GOING  TO BE LISTENING  FOR HOW WE CAN  HELP THEM GET UP  AND RUNNING AS  QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE. FROM THE  EMPLOYERS I\'M  HEARING FROM,  THAT\'S THEIR  DESIRE, TO HIT  THE GROUND  RUNNING: BUT  THERE\'S A  TREMENDOUS  UNDERSTANDING WE AT IT  RIGHT AND SAFE,  AND WE CANNOT  ALLOW THE  BOOMERANG TO  HAPPEN. HUGE LOGISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS. MANY HAVE BIG  WORKPLACES THAT  HAVE TO BE  THOUGHT OF VERY  SMARTLY IN TERMS  OF KEEPING  EVERYONE SAFE. THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY OUR  DEPUTY MAYOR AND  WE\'LL BRING  TOGETHER BUSINESS OWNERS FROM  AROUND THE CITY. THE NEXT GROUP  FOCUSES ON LABOR  AND WORKFORCE  DEVELOPMENT. LET\'S TAKE WHO IS HURTING MOST IN  THIS CRISIS,  WORKING PEOPLE,  WHO IS THIS  CITY -- WHY IS  THIS CITY GREAT? BECAUSE OF  WORKING PEOPLE. WHO MAKES THIS  CITY GREAT? WORKING PEOPLE. SO MANY PEOPLE  HAVE BEEN HEROS  DURING THIS  CRISIS KEEPING  THE CITY GOING  AND THEY WILL BE  THE HEROS IN THE  RESTART AND  RECOVERY AS WELL. THEY NEED TO BE  HEARD AND THEIR  RIGHT NEED TO BE  PROTECTED AND  THEIR NEEDS NEED  TO BE RECOGNIZED  AND THEIR VOICES  OFTEN LEFT OUT  WHEN GOVERNMENTS  MAKE THEIR  DECISIONS. THIS TIME WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT  AND HAVE WORKING  PEOPLE AND THOSE  WHO REPRESENT  WORKING PEOPLE AT THE TABLE FROM  THE BEGINNING. I AM A BIG  BELIEVER IN THE  POWER OF OUR  LABOR MOVEMENT. THEY WILL BE  FRONT AND CENTER. THEIR VOICES WILL BE HEARD AS WE  BUILD THIS  RESTART AND  RECOVERY. THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY FIRST  DEPUTY MAYER. NOW, SOMETHING  THAT NEW YORK  CITY  UNQUESTIONABLY,  ALL OF THOSE  AMAZING  ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF THE INCREDIBLY TALENTED PEOPLE  IN OUR ARTS  COMMUNITY AND  CULTURAL  COMMUNITY AND  TOURISM SECTOR. WE\'RE BRINGING  TOGETHER A GROUP  FOCUSED ON THOSE  AREAS, BECAUSE IT IS THE ESSENCE OF SO MUCH THAT  MAKES NEW YORK  CITY GREAT. IN OUR HEARTS AND SOULS, WHAT WE  ARE PROUD OF,  OBVIOUSLY ALSO  ONE OF THE  UNDERPINNINGS OF  OUR ECONOMY. AND ONE OF THE  PIECES THAT WE\'VE BEEN MISSING  DEEPLY HAS TO  COME BACK STRONG, HAS TO COME BACK  SMART. BUT THIS IS ALSO  A SECTOR WHERE  SOME OF THE  BIGGEST  CHALLENGES ARE,  BECAUSE  SYNONYMOUS WITH  GATHERING A LOT  OF PEOPLE  TOGETHER IN ONE  PLACE, SOME OF  OUR ARTS AND  CULTURAL VENUES  GATHER THOUSANDS  AND THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE IN CLOSE  QUARTERS. HOW ARE WE GOING  TO GO ABOUT THAT  IN THE FUTURE? WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO WHAT? THAT\'S WHAT WE\'RE GOING TO WORK  THROUGH WITH THIS GROUP, STRIKE  THAT BALANCE. SAFETY FIRST,  HEALTH OF PEOPLE  FIRST, THAT\'S JOB ONE. BUT WE WANT TO  BRING THIS SECTOR BACK STRONG. WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT  STAGES TO DO  THAT. THE DEPUTY MAYOR  WILL BE LEADING  THIS GROUP  WORKING WITH  LEADERS FROM  THESE FIELDS. THE FAITH-BASED  COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS A  CLEAR FACT WE  NEED FAITH MORE  THAN EVER IN  EVERY SENSE IN  THIS CITY AND OUR FAITH-BASED  COMMUNITIES ARE  PART OF WHAT  HOLDS NEW YORK  CITY TOGETHER,  WHAT GIVES PEOPLE THE STRENGTH. THE PERSEVERANCE  WE ALL NEED. AND IN THIS CITY, IT\'S A BEAUTIFUL  THING. I SEE IT WITH MY  OWN EYES. OUR FAITH LEADERS WORTT  NEK THE TIME. SO THIS COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE  CRUCIAL TO OUR  COMEBACK  SPIRITUALLY, AS  WELL AS IN TERMS  OF ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO BRING THIS  CITY BACK  MATERIALLY. NOW, OUR FAITH  LEADERS DESERVE  TREMENDOUS CREDIT BECAUSE CLEARLY  THIS IS AS CLOSE  TO UNANIMITY AS  IT GETS, WE HAVE  SEEN FAITH  LEADERS IN EVERY  BACKGROUND SAY  SAFETY FIRST. THEY\'V N TI DOWN  WORSHIP SERVICES  AND MAKING SURE  IT WAS ABOUT  PEOPLE\'S SAFETY. I COMMEND THEM  AND THANK THEM  FOR THAT. THE VALUE HAS  BEEN ON HUMAN  BNGS HUMAN  LIFE AND THAT\'S  BE POWERFUL AND COMMENDABLE. NOW, THE  PRACTICAL  QUESTIONS THAT  COMES INTO PLAY,  HOW ARE WE GOING  TO RESTART  WORSHIP SERVICES  AND WHAT\'S THE  RIGHT WAY TO DO  IT, WHEN AND WH CONDITIONS. IS IT SOMETHING  THAT LIKE THE  OTHER LARGER  GATHERINGS HAS TO BE APPROACHED  SMARTLY. WE\'RE GOING TO BE LISTENING   VOICES OF OUR  LEADERS AS WE  DEVELOP THOSE  PLANS AND  EVERYTNG IS  GOING TO START TO MOVE IN THE  COMING DAYS AND  WEEKS AS WE PUT  THESE THINGS  TOGETHER. WE CAN PROJECT  STEP BY STEP AND  THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY DEPUTY  MAYOR PHIL  THOMPSON. OUR NEW SECTOR  COUNCIL THAT  WE\'RE ADDING IS  THE CONSTRUCTION  AND REAL ESTATE. BIG, BIG PART OF  THIS CITY, THE  ECONOMY, BIG PART OF WHAT MAKES NEW YORK NEW YORK AS  WELL. AND WE WANT WANT  TO GET BACK AND  WORK AND WE WANT  TO GET THEM BACK  TO WORK. BUT HERE ARE A  SET OF CHALLENGES AS WELL. DIFFERENT KINDS  OF WORK, SOME OF  WHICH MIGHT LEND  ITSELF BETTER TO  SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SOME OF WHICH MIGHT BE BETTER  IN TERMS OF  HEALTH. OTHER WORK IN  THIS FIELD  PRESENTS MORE  CHALLENGES,  PARTICULARLY  INDOOR WORK. WE\'VE GOT TO  FIGURE OUT WHAT  KIND OF PERSONAL  PROTECTIVE  EQUIPMENT IS  NEEDED, WHAT KIND OF DISTANCE IS  NEEDED, WHAT KIND OF SCHEDULE IS  NEEDED TO GET  THIS RIGHT. THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY DEPUTY  MAYER LAURA  ENGLAND. AND THOSE ARE THE INITIAL COUNCILS  AND WE\'LL BE  PUTTING OUT THOSE NAMES. FOUR MORE COMING  BEHIND THAT. THE GOOD NEWS IS  THIS IS AN  EXAMPLE OF  LISTENING TO  PEOPLE WHO ARE  THE EXPERTS  BECAUSE THEY LIVE THE LIFE, THEY DO THE WORK, THEY  UNDERSTAND WHAT  EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH. WE WANT TO HEAR  FROM THEM, WE  WANT TO HEAR  THEIR VOICES,  HELPING US  UNDERSTAND WHAT  WILL WORK. ALSO WARNING US  ABOUT WHAT MAY  NOT WORK. EVERYONE HAS THAT NEW YORK ENERGY,  A DESIRE TO GET  GOING. WE\'RE NEVER GOING TO LACK THAT. THESE FOLKS ARE  ALSO GOING TO  HELP US FIGURE  OUT HOW TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE AND  BASED ON REAL  EXPERIENCE AND  THEY WILL BE  PIVOTAL IN THE  EFFORT TO GET NEW YORK CITY GOING  AGAIN. I WANT TO SAY  THANK YOU IN  ADVANCE TO  EVERYONE WHO HAS  AGREED TO SERVE  ON THE ADVISORY  COUNCIL. WE\'RE GOING TO  ASK A LOT OF YOU  AND WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE FOR  YOUR WILLINGNESS  TO SERVE NEW YORK CITY. NOW, THAT IS --  WE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO GET READY  FOR THE RESTART  AND THE RECOVERY, BUT RIGHT NOW AS  WE\'RE DOING THAT  WORK, WE\'RE  FIGHTING EVERY  DAY AGAINST THIS  DISEASE, WE\'RE  FIGHTING EVERY  DAY TO MAKE SURE  THAT THE PEOPLE  OF THIS CITY ARE  KEPT WHOLE AND  SUPPORTED, NO  MATTER WHAT THIS  HORRIBLE CRISIS  THROWS AT US, AND THAT MEANS BOTH  THE HEALTH CARE  CRISIS AND THE  ECONOMIC CRISIS. WE TALKED ABOUT  MANY TIMES OUR  PRIORITIES RIGHT  NOW. FOUR THINGS. PEOPLE\'S HEALTH,  SAFETY, MAKING  SURE EVERYONE HAS FOOD TO EAT,  MAKING SURE  EVERYONE HAS A  ROOF OVER THEIR  HEAD. IN THAT LAST  CATEGORY, WE ALL  KNOW THE  CHALLENGES THE  CITY HAS FACED  FOR DECADES IS  HOMELESSNESS. AND WE ALSO KNOW  THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS OFTEN DEFIED  CONVENTIONAL  SOLUTIONS. THAT\'S WHY WE  STARTED TO DO  SOME  UNCONVENTIONAL  THINGS OVER THE  LAST YEARS. NOTHING MORE  POWERFUL THAN THE HOME STAT  STRATEGY AND THE  MORE IST VISION  CALLED THE  JOURNEY HOME,  WHICH IS ALL  OUT ENDING  PERMANENT STREET  HOMELESSNESS  THROUGH INTENSIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH  HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS WHO  LIVE ON THE  STREET. WE\'VE SEEN SOME  THINGS START TO  WORK AND WHAT  WE\'VE TALKED  ABOUT IN RECENT  DAYS WAS  SOMETHING THAT  HAD CLEARLY NOT  WORKED FOR A LONG TIME, WHICH WAS  THE REALITY THAT  MANY HOMELESS  PEOPLE,  PARTICULARLY IN  COLDER MONTHS OF  THE YEAR, WILL GO INTO THE SUBWAYS  AND IN MANY CASES GOING ALL NIGHT  GOING BACK AND  FORTH ON THE  SUBWAY LINES. WHAT A HORRIBLE  SITUATION FOR  EVERYONE,  STARTING WITH  THAT HOMELESS  INDIVIDUAL. NOT SAFE, NOT  RIGHT, NOT RIGHT  FOR THE PEOPLE  AROUND THEM ON  THE SUBWAY TRAIN  EITHER. IN RECENT DAYS,  SOME NEW AND  IMPORTANT  THINKING HAS  EMERGED BECAUSE  OF THIS CRISIS  AND BECAUSE OF  THE CHALLENGES IT CREATED AND  BECAUSE WE HAVE  TO THINK  DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW  KEEP MASS  TRANSIT RUNNING  AND HOW TO KEEP  IT SAFE AND CLEAN AND HOW TO  SUPPORT OUR  ESSENTIAL  WORKERS. THE GOVERNOR AND  I AND OUR TEAMS  AND EVERYONE AT  THE MTA, WE  WORKED ON THE  NOTION OF CLOSING THE SUBWAYS IN  THE OVERNIGHT  HOURS FOR DEEP  CLEANING AND ALSO AS A WAY TO  FACILITATE A  DIFFERENT KIND OF ENGAGEMENT WITH  THE HOMELESS. TO DISRUPT THAT  PATTERN THAT  EXISTED FOR  DECADES AND WAS  GETTING US  NOWHERE. I\'LL TELL YOU  SOMETHING. LAST NIGHT WAS  THE FIRST NIGHT  THAT WE GOT TO  SEE SOME EVIDENCE OF WHAT WOULD  HAPPEN IF THE  SUBWAYS WERE  CLOSED IN THOSE  LATE-NIGHT HOURS, THE DEEP CLEANING WAS HAPPENING AND EVERYONE HAD TO  LEAVE THE  STATIONS,  INCLUDING  HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS. WE ONLY HAVE AN  INITIAL SNAPSHOT  BECAUSE WE\'RE  TALKING ABOUT  SOMETHING THAT  JUST HAPPENED  HOURS AGO, BUT  THE INITIAL  SNAPSHOT IS A  POWERFUL AND  POSITIVE ONE. LAST NIGHT 139  HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS OUT  OF 252 WHO WERE  ENGAGED BY OUR  OUTREACH WORKERS  AND BY THE NYPD  OFFICERS TRAINED, 139 INDIVIDUALS  AGREED TO ACCEPT  SUPPORT, ACCEPT  SERVICES AND COME IN OFF THE  STREETS, COME IN  OUT OF THE  SUBWAYS. THIS NUMBER IS  EXTRAORDINARY. FIRST OF ALL,  MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE  ENCOUNTERED AND  ENGAGED AGREED TO LEAVE THE  SUBWAYS, TO LEAVE THE STREETS AND  COME IN. THAT\'S AN AMAZING REALITY TO BEGIN  WITH. BUT WE HAVE, MORE IMPORTANTLY,  NEVER, EVER SEEN  SO MUCH SUCCESS  IN A SINGLE NIGHT BEFORE. WE\'VE NEVER SEEN  THIS MANY PEOPLE, THIS HIGH A  PERCENTAGE OF  PEOPLE WHO ARE  LIVING ON THE  STREET AGREE TO  SOMETHING  DIFFERENT. AND IT\'S ONLY ONE NIGHT. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED A LOT MORE  INFORMATION AND  WE NEED TO SEE  HOW THINGS PLAY  OUT OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME,  BUT THIS NUMBER  IS STAGGERING,  BECAUSE, LOOK,  CONSISTENTLY WHAT FEDERAL SURVEYS  HAVE SHOWN IS  THAT THIS CITY,  AND I DON\'T SAY  IT WITH ANYTHING  BUT SORROW, BUT  THE FACTS IN THE  ANNUAL SURVEY  SHOWS SOMEWHERE  BETWEEN 3,500 AND 4,000 PEOPLE  LIVES ON OUR  STREETS AND  SUBWAYS COMBINED. IN ONE NIGHT 139  PEOPLE TOOK A  STEP TOWARDS  LEAVING THAT LIFE AND COMING IN TO  A SAFE HAVEN OR A SHELTER AND  STARTING THE  PROCESS OF  GETTING TO  LONG-TERM HOUSING AND NEVER GOING  BACK ON THE  STREETS. THAT\'S AN  EXTRAORDINARY  NUMBER FOR ONE  NIGHT AND VERY  ENCOURAGING. WE HAVE TO  SUSTAIN IT IN  MANY, MANY WAYS. WE\'VE GOT A LOT  OF WORK TO DO. BUT I WANT TO SAY TO EVERYONE  INVOLVED, NYPD,  TO EVERYONE IN  SOCIAL SERVICES  AND HOMELESS  SERVICES, TO THE  MTA, TO THE  GOVERNOR\'S TEAM,  WE ALL WORKED  TOGETHER ON THIS  VISION IN HOPES  THAT IT WOULD  CREATE SOMETHING  NEW AND THE VERY  FIRST NIGHT WAS A VERY HOPEFUL  SIGN. SO WE\'RE GOING TO KEEP AT IT AND  HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF  SOMETHING MUCH  BIGGER AND REALLY GOOD FOR PEOPLE  ALL OVER THE  CITY, AND  PARTICULARLY FOR  THOSE WHO ENDED  UP ON OUR STREETS AND SUBWAYS WHO  WANT TO GET BACK  TO A BETTER LIFE. NOW, A RELATED  POINT, I\'VE SAID  I WANT TO ALWAYS  GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE  WHEN OUR  COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDIA POINT OUT A PROBLEM THAT WE  NEED TO FIX. I ALWAYS  APPRECIATE  GETTING THAT KIND OF HEADS-UP SO WE CAN DO SOMETHING  ABOUT IT. LUCKILY, WE\'RE  ABLE TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. YESTERDAY IT WAS  TALKED ABOUT  THREE ENCAMPMENTS OF HOMELESS  PEOPLE. WHENEVER YOU SAY  THE WORK  ENCAMPMENT, IT\'S  HOMELESS PEOP  WHO HAVE SET UP  SORT OF A  LONG-TERM LIVING  ARRANGEMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT USED TO BE  COMMON ALL OVER  THE CITY. ABSOLUTELY  UNACCEPTABLE,  ABSOLUTELY NOT  RIGHT FOR THE  HOMELESS PEOPLE,  FOR THEIR HEALTH  AND SAFETY, NOT  RIGHT FOR THE  COMMUNITIES THEY  LIVE IN AND  EVERYONE AROUND. JUST NOT YET FOR  NEW YORK CITY,  AND FOR DECADES  IT WAS A NORM  THAT THESE CAMPS  EXISTED AND WERE  NOT DISRUPTED. IN MY  ADMINISTRATION WE MADE A DECISION  THAT FROM OUR  POINT OF VIEW IT  IS UNACCEPTABLE  TO HAVE A SINGLE  ENCAMPMENT  ANYWHERE IN NEW  YORK CITY AND  THEY HAVE TO BE  DISMANTLED ANY  TIME THEY\'RE  IDENTIFIED AND  THEY\'VE BEEN  DOING TH NOW  FOR YEARS AND  IT\'S REALLY  CAUSED THE  ENCAMPMENTS TO  BECOME A RARITY. WHENEVER WE SEE A NEW ONE, WE  IMMEDIATELY TAKE  IT DOWN BECAUSE  IT\'S NOT FAIR TO  ANYONE AND IT\'S  NOT HEALTHY AND  SAFE. JULIETTE  IDENTIFIED THREE  ENCAMPMENTS  YESTERDAY  MORNING. I WANT TO THANK  THE DEPARTMENTS  THAT HAVE WORKED  TOGETHER TO  DISMANTLE THOSE  ENCAMPMENTS. THE PEOPLE WHO  ARE LIVING THERE  HAVE BEEN OFFERED HELP. SO THOSE THREE  CONDITIONS HAVE  BEEN ADDRESSED  AND ANYBODY IN  THE MEDIA, ANY  TIME YOU SEE  SOMETHING LIKE  THAT, WE WANT TO  DIRECT IT  IMMEDIATELY. NEW YORKERS, IF  YOU SEE ANY PLACE WHERE HOMELESS  FOLKS ARE  CONGREGATING WE  NEED TO KNOW SO  WE CAN GET OUT  AND ADDRESS IT. WE NEED TO GET  THE PEOPLE HELP  AND GET THEM OFF  THE STREET. WELL, SPEAKING OF STREETS, SOME  GOOD NEWS TODAY  AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE  OPEN STREETS  INITIATIVE. THIS IS AN  INITIATIVE. CITY COUNCIL PUT  THIS IDEA OUT  THERE. IT\'S AN IDEA THAT NOW IS READY TO  GO INTO HIGHER  GEAR. I WANT TO THANK  THE CITY COUNCIL  FOR THEIR  PARTNERSHIP AND  WANT TO THANK THE NYPD AND  DEPARTMENT OF  TRANSPORTATION  AND DEPARTMENT OF PARTS. ALL THE CITY  AGENCIES ARE  WORKING TOGETHER  TO MAKE THIS  WORK, AND THANK  GOD, ALL THOSE  CITY AGENCIES  HAVE MORE AND  MORE OF THEIR  EMPLOYEES COMING  BACK WHO HAD BEEN SICK WITH  COVID-19. THE WORKFORCE IS  STRENGTHENED SO  WE CAN DO THIS  WITH THE RIGHT  KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT AND  MAKE THEM WORK  FOR EVERYONE. SO OVER THE LAST  FEW DAYS,  INCLUDING THE  WEEKEND, WE HAVE  OPENED OVER SEVEN MILES AND NOW  WE\'RE ADDING TWO  MORE MILES THAT  WILL BE OPEN  TOMORROW,  THURSDAY. IN THIS CASE,  THESE ARE  SPECIFIC SITES  THAT ARE BEING  MANAGED BY LOCAL  BUSINESS  IMPROVEMENT  DISTRICTS, SO  LOCAL  ORGANIZATIONS  THAT DO SUCH  IMPORTANT WORK  FOR THEIR  COMMUNITIES, AND  HAVE TAKEN  RESPONSIBILITY  THAT EVERYTHING  IS SET UP AND  MONITORED AND  SAFE. AND THEY WORK  VERY CLOSELY OF  COURSE WITH THE  NYPD AND DOT. I WANT TO THANK  THE FLAT IRON AND GARMENT DISTRICT  AND THE DOWNTOWN  BROOKLYN  PARTNERSHIP AND  THE THIRD AVENUE  IN THE BRONX. ALL OF THEM  STEPPED FORWARD  AND ARE GOING TO  ENSURE THAT THESE STREETS THAT YOU  CAN SEE ON THE  SLIDES WILL BE  OPEN STREETS,  AGAIN, STARTING  TOMORROW. I ALSO WANT TO  ANNOUNCE THAT ONE OPEN STREET THAT  WAS PART OF THE  VERY ORIGINAL  PILOT PROGRAM,  THIS ONE IS NOW  COMING BACK. IT\'S A HALF MILE  ALONG  JACKSONVILLE. THE PILOT  LOCATION IS NOW  BECOMING A  FULL-TIME  LOCATION FOR THE  DURATION OF THIS  CRISIS. AND AGAIN, THIS  IS THE NEXT PHASE AND MORE TO COME  SOON AS WE BUILD. ANOTHER THING WE  ARE BUILDING OUT  ALL OVER NEW YORK CITY IS THE  INITIATIVE TO  DISTRIBUTE FREE,  SAFE COVERINGS TO ALL NEW YORKERS  WHO NEED IT. THIS IS GETTING A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE. PEOPLE ARE REALLY THANKFUL TO BE  GETTING FACE  COVERINGS AND THE MORE THEY GET,  THE MORE THEY\'RE  USING THEM, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT  WE WANT. I TOLD YOU THIS  WEEK EARLIER THAT THEY WOULD BE  DISTRIBUTING  7.5 MILLION FREE  FACE COVERINGS. AND THAT IS  REALLY GOING TO  MAKE A HUGE  IMPACT AND SO  PEOPLE WHO WANT  TO KNOW WHERE  THEY CAN GET  THEM, AGAIN WE  HAVE A MAP THAT  IDENTIFIES  LOCATIONS ALL  OVER THE CITY. WE\'VE ADDED A  NUMBER OF  LOCATIONS SINCE  THE WEEKEND. ALL YOU HAVE TO  DO IS GO TO  NYC.GOV/FACE COVERINGS AND YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER  OF PLACES WHERE  YOU CAN GET A  FACE COVERING TO  HELP PROTECT  EVERYONE. YOUR FAMILIES,  YOUR FELLOW NEW  YORKERS, TO HELP  DRIVE BACK THIS  DISEASE. NOW, I LIKE TO  EXPRESS MY THANKS EVERY DAY. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE DOING SO  MANY GOOD THINGS  IN THIS CITY. 8.6 MILLION  PEOPLE PULLING  TOGETHER TO FIGHT BACK THIS  DISEASE. WELL, TODAY IS  ONE OF THOSE  NATIONAL DAYS OF  THANKS FOR A  PARTICULAR GROUP  THAT HAS BEEN  JUST UNBELIEVABLY HEROIC, AND THAT  IS OUR NURSES. TODAY IS NATIONAL NURSES DAY. SO LISTEN,  UNBELIEVABLE,  ABSOLUTELY  BREATHTAKING WHAT THE NURSES OF NEW YORK CITY HAVE  DONE DURING THIS  CRISIS. THEY\'RE HEROS TO  THIS CITY AND  HEROS TO THIS  WHOLE NATION. SO I THINK IT\'S A FAIR STATEMENT IF THERE\'S ANY NEW  YORKER OUT THERE  OR ANY AMERICAN  OUT THERE WHO  DIDN\'T APPRECIATE OUR NURSES  BEFORE, WELL,  THEY DAMN SURE  WELL APPRECIATE  THEM NOW. AND THAT IS JUST  AND FAIR THAT  NURSES ARE  FINALLY GETTING  THE RECOGNITION  THEY DESERVE. BUT WE SURE WANT  TO DO MORE. I\'VE HAD THE JOY  OF GOING OUT TO A NUMBER OF OUR  HOSPITALS, PLACES LIKE ELMERS  HOSPITAL, KINGS  COUNTY HOSPITAL,  A NUMBER OF  OTHERS, TO  APPLAUD ALL THE  HEALTH CARE  WORKERS, TAKE A  SPECIAL  APPRECIATION  THANKING OUR  NURSES FOR WHAT  THEY\'VE DONE  HERE. AND EVERYONE  TODAY, WHEN YOU  SEE ANY HEALTH  CARE WORKER, BUT  PARTICULARLY  SINCE IT\'S THEIR  DAY, WHEN YOU SEE A NURSE, SAY THE  WORDS THANK YOU  AND SAY IT WITH  PASSION, BECAUSE  THEY DESERVE ALL  THE THANKS IN THE WORLD. NOW, I\'LL FRAME  WHAT WE DO EACH  DAY, OF COURSE,  GO OVER OUR DAILY INDICATORS. I\'LL FRAME THIS  BY SAYING NOT  EVERY DAY GOES  THE WAY WE PLAN  IT. THE BIG TREND IS  GOOD, BUT  DAY-TO-DAY WE  STILL SEE  FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE SOBERING AND  IT\'S A REMINDER  DO NOT TAKE OUR  FOOT OFF THE GAS, DO NOT RELAX OUR  RULES UNTIL IT\'S  TIME, GET IT  RIGHT. FIGHT BACK THIS  DISEASE, AVOID  THAT BOOMERANG,  BECAUSE TODAY WE  SEE SOME NUMBERS  THAT REMIND US WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. SO ON THE FIRST  ONE, DAILY NUMBER OF PEOPLE  ADMITTED TO THE  HOSPITAL FOR  SUSPECTED  COVID-19. THAT NUMBER HAS  GONE UP. IT\'S GONE UP  MARKEDLY, ALSO A  MUCH SMALLER  BUSINESS, SO FROM 75 TO 109. WE\'VE GOT TO SEE  THAT GO DOWN. THE NUMBER OF  PEOPLE IN ICUs  ACROSS OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS FOR  SUSPECTED  COVID-19, STILL  TOO LARGE A  NUMBER. THE INCREASE IS  SMALL FROM 596 TO 599. WE\'VE GOT TO GET  THAT NUMBER DOWN. THAT\'S ANOTHER  KEY PIECE OF THE  PUZZLE. VERY GOOD NUMBER  TO GO DOWN IS THE THIRD ONE, THE  PERCENTAGE OF  PEOPLE TESTING  POSITIVE FOR  COVID-19, THAT IS DOWN FROM 22% TO  15%. OBVIOUSLY IT\'S A  UNIVERSAL MEASURE AND THAT IS A  GOOD EXAMPLE,  THAT\'S GOOD NEWS  TODAY. SO MORE FIGHT  AHEAD. WE WANT TO GET  ALL THESE NUMBERS GOING DOWN  TOGETHER. I AM CONVINCED WE WILL, BUT WE\'VE  GOT SOME MORE  WORK TO DO. SO THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO THAT WORD I STARTED WITH,  MODERATION. THINK OF THE  VIRUS AGAIN, GIVE IT HUMAN  CHARACTERISTICS  FOR A MOMENT. THIS IS A VIRUS  THAT SEEKS OUT  OUR WEAKNESSES. I TALKED A FEW  DAYS AGO ABOUT  SOME BIG CITIES  IN ASIA THAT  STARTED TO OPEN  UP A LITTLE TOO  FAST AND  UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO CLAMP BACK  DOWN AND IN FACT  ADD NEW  RESTRICTIONS. IN SOME CASES IT  WAS ONLY ONE PART OF THE CITY THAT  WAS A PROBLEM,  BUT IT BECAME A  PROBLEM FOR  EVERYONE. THIS DISEASE  LOOKS FOR OUR  WEAKNESSES AND  TRIES TO EXPLOIT  THEM. WE CAN\'T LET THAT HAPPEN. SO AGAIN, I SEE  ALL OVER THE CITY INCREDIBLE  DISCIPLINE AND  INCREDIBLE  ADHERENCE TO THE  RULES. I WANT EVEN MORE. I DON\'T WANT TO  LET THIS DISEASE  BACK IN THE DOOR. SO LET\'S KEEP  FIGHTING, BECAUSE I KNOW WE ALL  WANT THAT  RESTART, WE WANT  THAT RESTART AND  LET\'S GET IT  RIGHT RIGHT NOW,  AND WE\'LL DO IT  WITH MODERATION. THAT\'S HOW WE  MAKE SURE THAT  EVERY STEP WE  TAKE HOLDS AND  THEN WE TAKE THE  NEXT STEP. THAT\'S THE GAME  PLAN AND WE\'LL  HAVE A LOT MORE  TO SAY ON THIS IN THE COMING DAYS. A FEW WORDS IN  SPANISH. [ SPEAKING  FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ] SPEAKING FOREIGN  LANGUAGE. SPEAKING FOREIGN  LANGUAGE. >>> WITH THAT, WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO COLLEAGUES IN  THE MEDIA, AND AS ALWAYS, LET ME  KNOW THE OUTLET  OF EACH  JOURNALIST. >> JUST A QUICK  REMINDER ON THE  PHONE WE HAVE  DEPUTY MAY OR  BEAM,  COMMISSIONER  BANKS AND  TROTTENBERG AND  THE FIRST  QUESTION GOES TO  GLORIA FROM NEW  YORK ONE.  >> GOOD MORNING. MR. MAYOR, WE\'VE  HEARD THIS  MORNING, AND IT  WAS SAID 2,000  PEOPLE WERE  REMOVED  [ INAUDIBLE ] . I\'M WONDERING IF  YOU H ANY  INFORMON  THAT. AND OUT  THE  HOPES THAT YOU  WERLE TO  ENGAGE, CAN YOU  GIVE US AN IDEA  OF EXACTLY WHERE  THOSE PEOPLE WERE SENT? WHAT IS THE  RESOURCE THAT THE CITY IS USING AT  THIS TIME, AND  WHAT ARE YOU  DOING TO ENSURE  THAT THEY DON\'T  GO BACK ON THE  SUBWAYS WHEN THIS CRISIS IS OVER? >> GOT IT.  >> MY SECOND  QUESTION IS  THAT --  >> TIMEOUT. GUYS, I REALLY  NEED EVERYONE TO  UNDERSTAND THIS. GLORIA, THAT\'S A  MULTI-PART  QUESTION. WE\'RE GOING TO  STAY THERE WITH  THAT,  RESPECTFULLY. WE\'VE GOT THIS  RULE WHERE WE\'RE  TRYING TO GIVE AS MANY PEOPLE AN  OPPORTUNITY IN  THE TIME WE HAVE. THERE\'S A LOT  GOING ON THAT I  NEED TO GET BACK  TO EVERY DAY. SO I ORIGINALLY  SAID TO THESE  JOURNALISTS ONE  QUESTION. WE DECIDED TO  GIVE PEOPLE  ANOTHER QUESTION. WE\'RE TURNING  INTO THREE, FOUR, FIVE QUESTIONS. WE CAN\'T DO THAT. I\'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE ANSWER  WHAT YOU JUST  ASKED. GREAT MULTI-PART  QUESTION. WE\'RE GOING TO  ANSWER THAT AND  I\'M GOI T A  OU COLLEAGUES  WHO FOLLOW TO  PLEASE DO REALLY  LITERALLY ONE OR  TWO QUESTIONS. IF PEOPLE CAN\'T  DO THAT, THEN  WE\'RE GOING TO  HAVE TO CHANGE  THE FORMAT TO  MAKE IT SIMPLER,  BECAUSE WE JUST  NEED TO BE FAIR  TO EVERYONE. I WANT TO GET TO  AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. SO I\'M GOING TO  START AND THEN  TURN TO STEVE  BANKS. GLORIA, FROM WHAT I CAN SAY, AND I  WANT TO MAKE SURE WE\'RE SPEAKING  THE RIGHT  LANGUAGE HERE  ABOUT WHAT\'S  GOING ON. FIRST OF ALL,  AGAIN, VERY  THANKFUL FOR THE  COLLABORATION  WITH THE STATE  AND THE MTA. I THINK SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IS HAPPENING. STEVE WILL BE  ABLE TO TELL YOU  EVERYTHING WE\'RE  DOING ONCE PEOPLE DO AGREE TO  SERVICES, BECAUSE IT\'S SOMETHING  THAT\'S BEEN BUILT OVER THREE YEARS, THE HOME  INITIATIVE. IT\'S A PRETTY  WELL-OILED  MACHINE NOW WITH  GREAT RESULTS. SEVERAL THOUSAND  PEOPLE HAVE COME  IN OFF THE  STREETS AND NOT  COME BACK TO THE  STREETS. SO STEVE WILL  TALK TO ME ABOUT  WHAT WE DO WITH  PEOPLE TO MAKE  SURE THAT THEY  RECEIVE THOSE  SERVICES AND STAY TO THE MAXIMUM  EXTENT POSSIBLE. BUT TO THE  NUMBER, I WANT TO CAUTION THAT  AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\'S  ANNUAL STUDY  THAT\'S RUN FOR A  LONG TIME, SAYS  THE TOTAL NUMBER  OF HOMELESS  PEOPLE IN NEW  YORK CITY ON THE  STREETS, ON THE  SUBWAYS, ALL FIVE BOROUGHS IS  BETWEEN 3,500 AND 4,000. IN THE COLD  MONTHS, THE  WINTER MONTHS,  YOU SEE A LOT  MORE PEOPLE GO  INTO THE SUBWAYS. STEVE WILL GIVE  YOU HIS VIEW. HE\'S LITERALLY  ONE OF THE  LEADING EXPERTS  ON HOMELESSNESS  NOT ONLY IN NEW  YORK CITY, BUT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND  HE\'S BEEN AT IT  FOR ABOUT 30  YEARS. WHEN I HEAR THAT  NUMBER, I RESPECT PAT A LOT. I LIKE HIM AND  RESPECT HIM. I DON\'T  UNDERSTAND HOW  THAT NUMBER COULD BE ACCURATE,  GIVEN WHAT WE  KNOW OF  HOMELESSNESS IN  THE CITY AND THIS TIME OF YEAR,  IT\'S HARD FOR ME  TO IMAGINE THAT  MANY PEOPLE THAT  ARE ACTUALLY  STREET HOMELESS. THAT\'S DIFFERENT  FROM PEOPLE WHO  MIGHT LIVE IN A  SHELTER OR APPEAR TO BE HOMELESS  BUT MAY NOT BE  HOMELESS. BUT THAT NUMBER  SURPRISES ME IS  ALL I\'LL SAY. BUT STEVE, YOU\'RE THE EXPERT. TELL US WHAT YOU  THINK OF THAT.  >> STEVE, CAN YOU HEAR ME? >> THERE YOU GO. >> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE SAW LAST  NIGHT OUT IN THE  FIELD. WE WERE DOWN AT  THE WORLD TRADE  CENTER AND OTHER  LOCATIONS WORKING WITH THE STAFF. WE ENCOUNTERED  NORTH OF 250  PEOPLE AND ABOUT  60% OF THEM CAME  INSIDE AND WE  HAVE SHELTERS AND SAFE HAVENS. SO WE\'RE  PROVIDING THE  SAME SERVICES TO  THE PEOPLE LAST  NIGHT THAT  ENABLED US TO  BRING 2,500  PEOPLE OFF THE  STREET WHO  REMAINED OFF THE  STREET, AND  THAT\'S REALLY THE KEY METRIC. AND LOOK, SOME  PEOPLE MAY  RETURN, BUT WE\'LL BE BACK EVERY  NIGHT OFFERING A  HELPING HAND TO  GET THEM OFF THE  STREET HOPING FOR SUCCESS THAT  WE\'VE HAD OVER A  PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I ALSO WANT  TO PUT THE  NUMBERS IN  CONTEXT. AND AGAIN, WE  APPRECIATE THE  COLLABORATION  WITH NYPD AND THE SOCIAL SERVICES  STAFF. HALF THE PEOPLE  THAT YOU SEE IN  THE SUBWAYS ARE  TRANSIENT,  MEANING ONE OR  TWO NIGHTS, AND  YOU MAY NOT SEE  THEM AGAIN. LAST NIGHT THERE  WAS A FOCUS ON  THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE LONG-TERM ON  THE SUBWAYS. SO THAT\'S WHY I  THINK THE SUCCESS OF LAST NIGHT --  GRANTED IT\'S ONLY ONE NIGHT,  BRINGING IN 139  PEOPLE IS REALLY  WHAT WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON, THE  HUMAN BEINGS THAT ARE IN THE SUBWAY AND HAVE BEEN  THERE FOR A LONG  PERIOD OF TIME,  AS OPPOSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  THERE ONE OR TWO  NIGHTS AND YOU  NEVER SEE THEM  AGAIN. THAT\'S THE  PERCEPTION THAT  THERE\'S LOTS OF  PEOPLE THERE FOR  LONG PERIODS OF  TIME. OUR FOCUS IS ON  THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE REALLY THERE  A LONG PERIOD OF  TIME AND THOSE  ARE THE PEOPLE WE BROUGHT IN LAST  NIGHT.  >> STEVE, IF YOU  COULD TAKE ONE  MORE STEP IN THAT ANSWER, I THINK  WE ALL WANT TO  UNDERSTAND A  LITTLE BIT  BETTER. AGAIN, HEARING AN ESTIMATE OF  SEVERAL THOUSAND, MY QUESTION, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE  IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT COULD ALL BE STREET HOMELESS  FOLKS OR DO YOU  ASSUME THAT\'S  SOME COMBINATION  OF PEOPLE THAT IS STREET HOMELESS  AND OTHER KIND OF FOLKS? >> I THINK  EXPERIENCE TELLS  YOU THAT PEOPLE  END UP ON THE  STREETS FOR  PERIODS OF TIME  OR ARE PERCEIVED  FOR ALL RANGE OF  ECONOMIC REASONS, BUT THEY\'RE NOT  THE PEOPLE T",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AT  YOU SEE EVERY  DAY. THOSE ARE THE  PEOPLE THAT YOU  SEE EVERY DAY  THAT WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON IN THE PLAN. SO SOMEONE WHO  NIGHT BE  PANHANDLING, FOR  EXAMPLE, MAY WELL HAVE A HOME. I THINK THAT  PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS  WHEN THEY SEE  PEOPLE AND ASSUME THAT THEY DON\'T  HAVE A ROOF OVER  THEIR HEADS. WHAT WE\'RE DOING  WITH OUR SOCIAL  SERVICES STAFF IS ACTUALLY  DETERMINING WHICH INDIVIDUAL,  INDIVIDUAL BY  INDIVIDUAL, NEEDS OUR SERVICES THAT WE CAN BRING  INSIDE. AND SOMETIMES IT  ALL GETS LOST IN  LARGE NUMBERS. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT\'S ABOUT  HUMAN BEINGS AND  ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND WE\'LL  KEEP DOING THAT.  >> NEXT IS MARCIA FROM CB S2. GOOD MORNING,  MR. MAYOR, HOW  ARE YOU DOING? >> GOOD, MARCIA. HOW ARE YOU? >> GOOD. MY FIRST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH  SOCIAL DISTANCING ENFORCEMENT. AS YOU\'RE WELL  AWARE WILLIAMS  AND ADAMS, THE  NYPD ENFORCEMENT  OF SOCIAL  DISTANCING HAS  SHOWN DISPARITIES THAT THE  ENFORCEMENT HAS  BEEN SUBJECTIVE  AND SELECTIVE AND THEY WANT YOU TO  RELEASE DATA. I WONDER YOUR  TAKE ON IT AND IF YOU\'VE GIVEN ANY  INSTRUCTIONS TO  THE NYPD IN TERMS OF THE GUIDELINES FOR WHO GETS  APPROACHED AND  WHO GETS SUMMONS. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION HAS TO  DO WITH THE  HOMELESS AGAIN. HOMELESS  ADVOCATES ARE  SAYING THAT  YOU\'RE TAKING  HOMELESS PEOPLE  OFF THE SUBWAY  BUT NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH SAFE  ALTERNATIVES. YOUR RESPONSE TO  THAT? >> THANK YOU,  MARCIA. NO, I  RESPECTFULLY  DISAGREE  PROFOUNDLY WITH  THOSE ADVOCATES. I APPRECIATE  THEIR WORK, BUT  AGAIN, STEVE  BANKS LEADING OUR EFFORTS TO HELP  THE HOMELESS, ONE OF THE PREMIER  ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS FOR  DECADES IN THE  CITY AND THIS  COUNTRY. AND WHAT STEVE  HAS CREATED WAS A TEAM. AND WITH ALL THE  AMAZING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND THROUGH THE  OUTREACH IS  SOMETHING  UNPRECEDENTED IN  THE HISTORY OF  THE CITY AND IT  IS COMPASSIONATE  AND DECENT AND  IT\'S ABOUT  HELPING HOMELESS  FOLKS GET TO A  SAFE HAVEN OR A  SHELTER THAT  WORKS FOR THEM. WE\'VE BEEN ADDING SO MANY MORE  SPACES IN PLACES  THAT HOMELESS  PEOPLE -- YOU  KNOW, WHERE WE  FIND THEM, SO WE  HAVE PLACES THAT  WORK FOR THEM. WE PROVIDE  MEDICAL CARE,  FOOD, SUBSTANCE  ABUSE SUPPORT IN  TERMS OF PROGRAMS TO GET THEM OFF  SUBSTANCES. MENTAL HEALTH  SERVICES. IT\'S  EXTRAORDINARILY  COMPASSIONATE AND WE KNOW IT\'S  EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OVER 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE COME IN AND  NOT GONE BACK TO  THE STREETS. AND I WOULD THINK THE ADVOCATE  WOULD WANT TO  APPLAUD AND  SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT IS ENDING  STREET  HOMELESSNESS AND  HAS NEVER BEEN  DONE IN THE CITY  B ANDE\' P HUUNOF RESOURIN AND \'S CLERL  WORKING. AND THIS NEW  OPPORTUNITY  BECAUSE OF THE  COLLABORATION  WITH THE MTA I  THINK IS GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR  WIDER TO GETTING  MORE PEOPLE OFF  THE STREETS. ON THE QUESTION  OF THE NYPD, I\'VE BEEN IN TOUCH  WITH BOTH, THE  BOROUGH PRESIDENT AND PUBLIC  ADVOCATE, WHO HAD CONSTRUCTIVE  CONVERSATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THE  CONCERN 100%. I WANT TO SEE  FAIR AND EQUAL  POLICING  EVERYWHERE. THAT\'S WHAT WE\'VE BEEN DEVOTED TO  NOW FOR OVER SIX  YEARS. CHANGING THE  NATURE OF  POLICING IN NEW  YORK TO MAKE IT  FOCUSED ON BEING  RESPECTFUL AND  RESPONSIVE TO  EVERY COMMUNITY  AND MORE DEEPLY  CONNECTED TO  EVERY COMMUNITY. AND I THINK IT IS WORKING. I THINK THE  CHALLENGE WE ALL  HAVE WITH THIS  PANDEMIC IS WE\'RE LEARNING NOW WAYS AND APPROACHES. I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY ON HOW  WE\'RE GOING TO  REFINE OUR  APPROACH,  PARTICULARLY WITH WARMER MONTHS,  BUT THE MESSAGE  IS BE CONSISTENT  AMONG ALL  COMMUNITIES AND  COMMUNICATE WITH  PEOPLE, AS  ALWAYS, WITH  NEIGHBORHOOD  POLICING, HELP  PEOPLE TO  UNDERSTAND THIS  IS ABOUT THEIR  OWN HEALTH AND  SAFETY AND THEIR  FAMILIES. AND THE VAST  MAJORITY OF  PEOPLE, MARCIA,  ARE ACCEPTING  THESE RULES AND  FOLLOWING THESE  RULES. IT\'S ACTUALLY  BEEN QUITE RARE THT NYPD OR  ANY OTHER AGENCY  ENCOUNTERS MUCH  RESISTANCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW YORKERS  GET IT AND  THEY\'RE LIVING  THIS WAY. SOMETIMES THEY  HAVE TO BE  REMINDED, BUT  THEY ACCEPT AND  REACT  ACCORDINGLY. WE DEFINITELY  WANT TO GET THE  DATA OUT. SO WE WILL MAKE  SURE THE NYPD  GETS THE DATA  OUT. IT\'S GOING TO  SHOW YOU WHERE  THERE HAVE BEEN  SUMMONS, BUT  THERE HASN\'T BEEN A NEED TO DO A  LOT OF SUMMONS IN THE LAST TWO  MONTHS FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. THAT\'S A GOOD  THING. BUT DEFINITELY  THAT KIND OF  TRANSPARENCY WILL BE PROVIDED.  >> MATT IS UP  NEXT. MATT. >> GOOD MORNING,  MAYOR. TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST, THIS  MORNING ON TV YOU SAID THEY\'RE  PREPARING FOR  FURLOUGHS AND  LAYOFFS. HOW MANY PEOPLE  ARE YOU PREPARING TO FURLOUGH OR  LAYOFF. AND SECONDLY,  ABSENT A CRIME,  IF TWO PEOPLE WHO LIVE TOGETHER  HAVE A RIGHT TO  BE IN PUBLIC  WITHOUT  PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING, YES  OR NO? >> SO MATT, ON  THE SOCIAL  DISTANCING ISSUE, THE WAY I\'VE  UNDERSTOOD IT  FROM THE  BEGINNING, AND  DR. BARBOT CAN  COMMENT ON THIS,  TOO, THAT IF  PEOPLE ARE  ALREADY ENTIRELY  EXPOSED TO EACH  OTHER ALL DAY  LONG IN THEIR  HOUSEHOLD, SOCIAL DISTANCING IS A  DIFFERENT CONCEPT THAN IT IS FOR  FOLKS WHO ARE NOT EXPOSED TO EACH  OTHER. IF YOU\'RE ALREADY IN CONSTANT  CONTACT WITH  SOMEONE, IT DOES  NOT REQUIRE THE  SAME APPROACH AS  IF TWO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIVE UNDER THE SAME  HOUSEHOLD -- SAME ROOF, LIKE YOU  SAY, COME IN  CONTACT. SO OUR FOCUS IN  ENFORCEMENT IS TO MAKE SURE, FIRST  AND FOREMOST,  THERE\'S NOT LARGE GATHERINGS, NOT  ANY KIND OF  GATHERINGS. SECOND, THAT  SOCIAL DISTANCING IS RECOGNIZED. THIRD, THAT  PEOPLE HAVE FACE  COVERINGS ON, IN  THAT ORDER. ON THE QUESTION  OF FURLOUGHS AND  LAYOFFS, WHAT I  SAID THIS MORNING IS I\'VE BEEN  TALKING TO MAYORS ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY,  REPUBLICAN AND  DEMOCRAT BOTH. SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS AND SOME  OF THEM HAVE  ALREADY ANNOUNCED FURLOUGHS. SOME OF THEM ARE  PLANNING TO. EVERY ONE OF US  HAS TO START  LOOKING AT THAT  POSSIBILITY IF WE DON\'T HAVE ANY  MONEY. WE HAVE A BUDGET  COMING UP IN  JUNE. I\'M NOT HERE TO  PROJECT ANYTHING  WHILE WE\'RE IN  THE MIDDLE OF  FIGHTING FOR THE  STIMULUS FUNDING, BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHAT WILL GET US  OUT OF THIS MESS  AND THAT\'S WHAT  NEW YORK CITY  DESERVES. THAT\'S WHAT  EVERYONE  DESERVES. THE STIMULUS  MONEY MAKES US  WHOLE AND  REPLACES ALL THE  LOST REVENUE AND  ALLOWS US TO  RETAIN OUR  WORKFORCE AND  MAKE SURE THAT  PUBLIC SERVICES  ARE BEING  PROVIDED, BASIC  SERVICES SO WE  CAN GET ON WITH  THE RESTART AND  RECOVERY. I\'VE BEEN TALKING NONSTOP TO OUR  MEMBERS OF THE  CONGRESSIONAL  DELEGATION. I SPEAK TO  SPEAKER PELOSI ON SUNDAY. WE NEED TO GET  THAT STIMULUS  DONE SO THAT  PEOPLE DON\'T HAVE TO EXPERIENCE  FURLOUGHS,  LAYOFFS. IF IT DOESN\'T  HAPPEN AND WE\'RE  MISSING  $7.4 BILLION IN  REVENUE, THEN ALL OPTIONS ARE ON  THE TABLE. BUT IT\'S NOT TIME TO TALK ABOUT  THAT YET.  >> ERIN FROM  POLITICO IS NEXT. >> ON THE  QUESTION OF  HOMELESS PEOPLE  ON THE SUBWAY, DOq I UNDERSTAND  CORRECTLY THESE  FOLKS IF THEY  ACCEPT YOUR  OFFER, THEY\'RE  BEING SENT TO  SHELTERS, AND IS  THERE ANY  CONSIDERATION OF  OFFERING THEM A  HOTEL ROOM, IF  THAT MIGHT BE  SAFER THAN  SHELTERS? >> AGAIN I\'M  GOING TO TURN TO  COMMISSIONER  BANKS, BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT OVER THESE LAST  YEARS -- THAT\'S  ANOTHER THING  THAT DIDN\'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION  AND IT REALLY  SHOULD HAVE. I\'M PUTTING IT  INTO THE LIGHT  NOW. FOR DECADES THERE WAS A BAD  DIVISION OF  LABOR, I THINK,  IN THE CITY WHERE SHELTERS THAT  NEEDED POSITIVE  INFLUENCE IN THE  NYPD DIDN\'T HAVE  IT. AND SOME YEARS  AGO WE MADE THE  DECISION, AND I  REALLY WANT TO  THANK THE NYPD  FOR SEEING HOW  IMPORTANT THIS  WAS. TO HAVE THE NYPD, GO INTO THE  SHELTERS,  SUPERVISE AND  TRAIN THE STAFF  AND HAVE A  PRESENCE. THAT\'S BEEN  TREMENDOUSLY  HELPFUL IN TERMS  OF MAKING  SHELTERS SAFER. ON TOP OF THAT,  WE INVESTED IN  THE SAFE HAVENS,  WHICH ARE MUCH  SMALLER  FACILITIES. SO I THINK WE  HAVE TO KEEP IN  MIND THAT THE  REALITIES OF OUR  SHELTER SYSTEM  ARE DIFFERENT  THAN WHAT THEY  WERE A FEW YEARS  AGO, DIFFERENT  ALSO BECAUSE WE  HAVE MORE SAFE  HAVEN. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT  THE INDIVIDUAL  AND WHAT THEY  NEED. STEVE CAN SPEAK  ABOUT IT MORE  ELOQUENTLY THAN  ME. BUT DEPENDING ON  THE INDIVIDUAL,  THEY NEED CERTAIN SERVICES AND  SUPPORT. SOME PEOPLE COULD FIT IN A HOTEL  ROOM FINE AND  OTHERS MAY NOT  AND MAY NEED  SUPERVISION AND  SUPPORT. WE\'RE TAILORING  IT. WE HAVE HOTEL  ROOMS AVAILABLE  BUT THE DECISION  BECOMES  CASE-BY-CASE. STEVE, WHY DON\'T  YOU JUMP IN.  >> IF I COULD  JUST ADD TO THAT, I THINK IT\'S  IMPORTANT TO  UNDERSTAND THE  RANGE OF TOOLS WE NOW HAVE TO MEET  PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND HELP  PEOPLE COME IN  FROM THE STREETS. IN TERMS OF OUR  OVERALL SHELTER  SYSTEM, RIGHT NOW 7,000 OF SINGLE  ADULTS OUT OF THE 17,000 SINGLE  ADULTS ARE  ACTUALLY IN  COMMERCIAL HOTEL  ROOMS AS PART OF  SOME ISSUES THAT  PRECEDED COVID-19 AND SOME THAT  HAVE BEEN PUT IN  PLACE SINCE  COVID-19, AND  WE\'RE CONTINUING  TO MOVE PEOPLE  OUT OF THE  SHELTERS INTO  COMMERCIAL HOTEL  ROOMS AND THAT  WILL CONTINUE. SO COMING INTO  OUR REGULAR  SHELTERS, THERE  ARE PATHWAYS TO  GET INTO A  COMMERCIAL HOTEL  ROOM, WHICH WE\'RE BRINGING ONLINE  EVERY DAY. IN TERMS OF THE  TOOLS THAT WE  HAVE TO BRING  PEOPLE INTO OUR  TRADITIONAL  SHELTERS, WE\'VE  ADDED COMMERCIAL  HOTEL ROOMS TO  THAT SYSTEM. WE ALSO HAVE THE  SAFE HAVEN BEDS  AND STABILIZATION BEDS WHICH ARE IN HOTELS NOW THAT  HAVE ENABLED US  TO BRING THE  PEOPLE IN OFF THE STREETS OVER THE  PAST SEVERAL  YEARS AND PEOPLE  ARE ACCEPTING  THOSE BEDS EVERY  NIGHT, PEOPLE  FROM THE STREETS. AND I THINK WE  ANNOUNCED A WEEK  AGO THAT EVEN  DURING THE  PANDEMIC, WE\'VE  ADDED ANOTHER 200 BEDS IN THE SAFE  HAVENS AS A  PATHWAY OFF THE  STREETS FOR HUMAN BEINGS. SO THERE ARE A  RANGE OF OPTIONS  FROM OUR SHELTER  SYSTEM NOW HAS,  SOME OF WHICH WE  DIDN\'T HAVE  BEFORE, AND  THEY\'RE USING ALL THESE TOOLS TO  TRY TO BRING  PEOPLE IN FROM  OFF THE STREETS. >> DEBRA LEE. >> GOOD MORNING,  EVERYONE. CAN YOU HEAR ME? >>.  >> YEAH, DEBRA  LEE. HOW ARE YOU  DOING? >> I\'M WELL. THANK YOU. I WANTED TO  FOLLOW UP,  MR. MAYOR, AND  I\'M NOT SURE IF  COMMISSIONER SHEA IS ON, BUT I  WANTED TO FOLLOW  UP ON THE  CONVERSATION  ABOUT THE  ENFORCEMENT ON  SOCIAL  DISTANCING. SPECIFICALLY  ABOUT THA  THAT YOU\'VE GOT  BOTH THE  PRESIDENT PAT  LYNCH AND OTHERS  SAYING THAT  THERE\'S JUST NOT  ENOUGH CLARITY  AROUND THE  GUIDANCE, THAT  THERE AREN\'T  RULES FOR WHAT  POLICE OFFE A PD   DO WHEN THEY  APPROACH PEOPLE  FOR VIOLATION OF  SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES. MOREOVER, OTHERS  ARE SAYING THIS  IS ANOTHER  OPPORTUNITY FOR  SUBJECTIVE  POLICING AND  PARTICULARLY AS  THE WARMER MONTHS APPROACH THAT  IT\'S GOING TO  BECOME ANOTHER  OPPORTUNITY FOR  MISTAKES. THAT SAID, CAN  YOU SPEAK TO THE  FACT THAT OTHERS  ARE CALLING FOR  OTHER AGENCIES,  THE OTHER  INDIVIDUALS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS  OTHER THAN POLICE OFFICERS, THAT  THIS IS IN FACT  NOT A POLICING  CONVERSATION, BUT PARTICULARLY  YOU\'VE GOT MORE  PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREETS, THAT  THIS SHOULD  BECOME A CITYWIDE CONVERSATION  ACROSS OTHER  AGENCIES? AND THEN FINALLY, I WANTED TO ASK  THE COMMISSIONER  BARBOT, WITH  PARENTS CONCERNED ABOUT VISITING  DOCTORS, WHAT  GUIDANCE IS THE  CITY OFFERING FOR PARENTS WHO WANT  TO MAKE SURE  THEIR CHILDREN  ARE VACCINATED ON TIME AND  RECEIVING THE  VISITS THAT THEY  NEED IN LIGHT OF  THE FACT THAT  THERE IS NOW  KAWASAKI AND  THEY\'RE ASKING  PEOPLE NOT TO  TRAVEL AND VISIT  DOCTORS UNLESS  THEY ABSOLUTELY  NEED TO? >> I\'M GOING TO  LET DR. BARBOT  ANSWER THAT AND  I\'LL DOUBLE BACK  TO THE POLICING  ANSWER. I\'VE BEEN VERY  STRUCK ALREADY,  DEBORAH LEE, BY  VISITS TO A  COUPLE OF OUR  CLINICS, IN SOUTH BRONX AND CONEY  ISLAND, THAT THEY ARE REPORTING SO  MUCH MORE USE OF  TELEMEDICINE IN  THIS CRISIS AND  THAT IS ACTUALLY  GETTING EVERYONE  MORE USED TO  USING IT AND A  LOT OF THE  PATIENTS, A LOT  OF THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE CLINIC  ARE GETTING MORE  COMFORTABLE WITH  THAT OPTION. SO EVEN AS WE\'RE  NAVIGATING, THE  PEOPLE LIMITING  TRAVEL ARE NOT  BEING WILLING TO  GO OUT, I DO  THINK WE\'RE  SEEING MORE USE  OF TELEMEDICINE  IN A HELPFUL WAY  AND IT\'S  SOMETHING WE WANT TO DEEPEN IN OUR  EFFORTS AS WELL. WE\'LL HAVE MORE  TO SAY ON THAT  SOON. BUT IN TERMS OF  HOW TO ADVISE  PARENTS,  COMMISSIONER  BARBOT WILL JUMP  IN AND THEN I\'LL  COME BACK ON THE  OTHER QUESTION.  >> YES, THE  QUESTION IS A  CRITICALLY  IMPORTANT ONE. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE HEAR NEW  INFORMATION THAT  IS POTENTIALLY  SCARY FOR  PARENTS, LIKE  KAWASAKI OR THAT  TYPE OF SYNDROME, IT CAN MAKE  PARENTS MORE  HESITANT OR  CONCERNED ABOUT  WHAT THEY SHOULD  BE DOING FOR  THEIR CHILDREN. SO I WANTED TO  CLARIFY THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE  HEARING ABOUT  KAWASAKI MORE AND MORE, IT STILL  REMAINS A  RELATIVELY RARE  CONDITION AND WE  WANT TO DRAW  ATTENTION TO IT  BECAUSE DURING  THIS TIME IT CAN  BE CONFUSED WITH  OTHER THINGS AND  WE WANT TO LOSE  TIME IN TERMS OF  CHILDREN GETTING  TO TREATMENT THAT CAN BE  DEFINITIVE. IN ADDITION, WE  WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY  PARENTS, BUT  MOTHERS IN  CHILDREN, KNOW  THAT HEALTH CARE  IS OPEN FOR  BUSINESS. WE WANT NEW  YORKERS TO SEEK  CARE FOR  CONDITIONS THAT  THEY MAY HAVE  THAT THEY\'VE HAD  TO PUT OFF. AS THE MAYOR  SAID, IT DOESN\'T  NECESSARILY MEAN  GOING TO THE  OFFICE IN PERSON, BUT IT COULD MEAN HAVING ACCESS, IT COULD BE A WHOLE  HOST OF WAYS IN  WHICH MEDICAL  PRACTICES ARE NOW ADJUSTING TO  SOCIAL DISTANCING AND HOW THEY  CONDITION TO SEE  PATIENTS AND  ENSURE THAT THEY  HAVE ONGOING  CARE. SO THAT ALSO  EXTENDS TO  CHILDREN GOING TO THEIR  PEDIATRICIANS TO  GET THEIR  NECESSARY  VACCINATIONS. WE WANT THEM TO  CONTINUE TAKING  CHILDREN TO THEIR PEDIATRICIAN AND  ENSURE THAT THEY  HAVE THE PROPER  FACE COVERINGS  WHEN THEY GO. WE ARE WORKING  WITH CLINICAL  PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY  ARE ALSO  AVAILABLE TO  PROVIDE PATIENTS  WITH NECESSARY  VACCINATIONS. WE ARE VERY MUCH  ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO MAKE SURE  PARENTS KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE  BRINGING THEIR  CHILDREN IN TO  GET THEIR VAX    NATIONS AS  SCHEDULED. WE DON\'T WANT  CHILDREN GETTING  INFECTIONS OR  CONDITIONS THAT  ARE  VACCINE- PREVENTABLE. SO THAT\'S A  REALLY IMPORTANT  QUESTION AND IT\'S AN OPPORTUNITY  FOR US TO GET OUT THE MESSAGE THAT  MEDICINE IS OPEN  FOR BUSINESS AND  THAT PRACTICES  ARE SEEING  PATIENTS FOR  THINGS OTHER THAN COVID AND THAT  THERE ARE WAYS TO CONDUCT THESE  VISITS THAT DON\'T ALWAYS NEED AN  IN-PERSON VISIT. >> GOOD MORNING,  MR. MAYOR. YOU DIDN\'T REALLY ANSWER THE FIRST  PART OF DEBRA  LEE\'S QUESTION.  >> JEFF, HOLD UP, I MEANT TO AND I  GOT CAUGHT UP IN  OTHER THINGS. MY APOLOGY AND  THEN WE\'LL COME  BACK TO YOUR  QUESTION. YES, DEBRA LEE,  ON THE PREVIOUS. SO AGAIN, WE ARE  DEALING WITH  SOMETHING THAT IS ENTIRELY NEW  STILL TO ALL OF  US. IT\'S GOING TO  TAKE TIME TO GET  IT AS GOOD AS IT  SHOULD BE. BUT I THINK THE  CORE REALITIES  ARE STILL STRONG, MEANING WE HAVE  FOR YEARS NOW  BUILT UP A  PHILOSOPHY OF  NEIGHBORHOOD  POLICING. WE HAVE A WHOLE  NEW GENERATION OF POLICE OFFICERS  WHO HAVE BEEN  TRAINED IN THIS,  ALL THE ENTIRE  FORCE HAS BEEN  TRAINED IN THIS  PHILOSOPHY IN  DE-ESCALATION. I THINK WE\'VE  SEEN TWO MONTHS  NOW OF THE NYPD  ENGAGING THE  PEOPLE OF THE  CITY IN THE  CONTEXT OF THE  CORONAVIRUS. AND I HAVE TO SAY I OBVIOUSLY EVERY DAY AM LISTENING  FOR WHAT IS  WORKING AND  WHAT\'S NOT. WE\'VE SEEN A  COUPLE OF REALLY  UNUNFORTUNATE AND INAPPROPRIATE  INSTANCES, BUT  ONLY IN MY VIEW A VERY SMALL NUMBER COMPARED TO THE  VAST NUMBER OF  INTERACTIONS  BETWEEN THE  OFFICERS IN OUR  COMMUNITIES THAT  HAVE GONE THE  RIGHT WAY. AND I WANT TO  KEEP THINGS IN  EXPECTIVE. OUR OFFICERS ARE  TRYING TO  UNDERSTAND HOW TO BE EFFECTIVE IN  THIS PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO DO  MORE TO CREATE  CLEAR, SIMPLE  PROTOCOLS AND  MAKE SURE THEIR  SUPERVISORS ARE  SUPPORTING THEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO  REMEMBER THAT FOR WEEKS WE HAD THE  NYPD MISSING A  HUGE PERCENTAGE  OF ITS OFFICERS  BECAUSE OF THE  DISEASE. WE\'RE NOW COMING  TO A SITUATION  WHERE THE FORCE  IS COMING BACK TO ITS NORMAL  LEVELS. WE\'RE GETTING  MORE AND MORE  EXPERIENCE WITH  WHAT WORKS, WHAT  DOESN\'T WORK IN  TERMS OF TRYING  TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT. THE HIERARCHY I  PRESENT IS WE\'RE  MOST CONCERNED  ABOUT LARGER  GATHERINGS. THAT\'S WHERE THE  MOST DANGER IS. AND THEN  ENFORCING SOCIAL  DISTANCING ON A  MORE INDIVIDUAL  LEVEL AND THEN  THE FACE  COVERINGS. AND MOST  PEOPLE -- THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE,  AND I\'VE CHECKED  THIS MANY TIMES  OVER WITH  COMMUNITY LEADERS AND WITH THE  NYPD. MOST PEOPLE, WHEN ASKED TO CREATE  MORE DISTANCE  FROM THE PEOPLE  AROUND THEM OR  ARE ASKED TO PUT  ON A FACE  COVERING, THEY\'RE DOING IT. SO WE\'RE NOT  HAVING OVERALL A  COMPLIANCE  PROBLEM. WE DO NEED TO  GIVE CLEAR  GUIDANCE, AND TO  THE OTHER POINT,  WE DEFINITELY  WANT TO BRING  COMMUNITY LEADERS AND COMMUNITY  ORGANIZATIONS  MUCH MORE DEEPLY  INTO THIS. PREVIOUSLY WHEN  THE VIRUS WAS ON  THE CONSTANT  UPSWING, THAT  WASN\'T OUR FOCUS, OBVIOUSLY. NOW THAT WE\'RE  GETTING SOME  RELIEF, IT\'S  SOMETHING WE CAN  DO MORE AND MORE, AND OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE WARMER  WEATHER IT MAKES  SENSE TO DO IT  MORE AND MORE. WE\'LL HAVE MORE  TO SAY ON THAT IN THE COMING DAYS  AS WELL. NOW JEFF. >> THANKS. JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT QUESTION, THE INTERACTIONS  WE\'VE SEEN  BETWEEN POLICE  AND ENFORCEMENT  OF INDIVIDUALS  SOCIAL  DISTANCING, DO  YOU THINK THAT  THERE\'S A BENEFIT TO THAT  ENFORCEMENT OR  DOES IT OUTWEIGH  THE RISK OF THESE NEGATIVE  INTERACTION IS? AND THEN  SECONDLY, O THE  SUBWAY, WHAT ARE  YOUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT A RETURN TO 24-HOUR SERVICE? DO YOU HAVE ANY  SORT OF TIMELINE  AND DO YOU EXPECT THE 24-HOUR  SERVICE WILL  EVENTUALLY  RETURN? >> YES, JEFF,  ABSOLUTELY. THAT\'S A  CONVERSATION THE  GOVERNOR AND I  HAD AS PART OF  THE DECISION TO  MOVE TO THE  OVERNIGHT  CLEANING. HE WAS CLEAR, I  WAS CLEAR, WE  WERE TOTALLY  UNIFIED, THAT WE  WILL RETURN TO  24-HOUR SERVICE. OBVIOUSLY THE  STATE RUNS THE  MTA, BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT  WAS PREREQUISITE  TO THE CITY  AGREEING TO THIS  PLAN AND AGREEING TO PUTTING THE  RESOURCES INTO  IT. WHEN THE CRISIS  IS OVER, WE WOULD RESUME 24-HOUR  SERVICE. THE ANSWER TO  YOUR QUESTION IS  WHEN THE CRISIS  IS OVER AND THAT  WILL DETERMINED  BY OUR  INDICATORS, THAT  WILL BE  DETERMINED BY  WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DISEASE. LOOK, MY GENERAL  HOPE IS THAT  WE\'RE GOING TO  SEE MORE AND MORE NORMALCY FOR THE  NEXT FEW MONTHS,  WITH PARTICULARLY THIS AGGRESSIVE  TEST AND TRACE  APPROACH, AND  THAT IT WILL GET  BETTER WITH EACH  MONTH. AND WHEN WE GET  TO SEPTEMBER,  PARTICULARLY AT  THE BEGINNING OF  SCHOOL, I WANT  THE BEGINNING OF  SCHOOL TO HAPPEN  FULLY AND SAFELY  AND THAT IS ONE  OF THOSE THINGS I THINK WILL SIGNAL THAT NEW YORK  CITY IS BACK IN A REALLY STRONG  WAY. I WANT TO GET US  THERE AGAIN, THE  MODERATION  APPROACH TO GET  US THERE. SO I\'M NOT GOING  TO BE SURPRISED  IF THE OVERNIGHT  CLEANING GOES ON  FOR MONTHS  BECAUSE THE  HEALTH DYNAMICS  REQUIRE IT. BUT MY HOPE IS  IT\'S A MATTER OF  MONTHS AND THEN  WE CAN GET BACK  TO THE 24-HOUR  SERVICE. ON THE QUESTION  OF POLICE  OFFICERS, I\'VE  HAD THIS  CONVERSATION WITH COMMISSIONER  SHEA. IT\'S ABSOLUTELY  ESSENTIAL THAT  OFFICERS WEAR  MASKS. THE IDEA IS, OF  COURSE, FOR THEIR ROLE THAT THEY  PLAY IN OUR  SOCIETY, EVERYONE LOOKS TO THEM FOR GUIDANCE. EVERYONE LOOKS TO THEM AS AN  EXAMPLE. WE WANT PEOPLE  WEARING MASKS  WHEN THEY\'RE  OUTSIDE AND  COMING IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE. LOOK, THE RULE IS CLEAR. IF YOU\'RE OUTSIDE AND YOU\'RE NOT  COMING IN CONTACT WITH ANYONE,  THAT\'S A  SITUATION WHERE  YOU ARE NOT  REQUIRED TO WEAR  A MASK. BUT I THINK IT\'S  SAFE TO SAY  POLICE OFFICERS  ARE IN CONTACT  WITH PEOPLE VERY  REGULARLY, AND SO THE NOTION OF  WEARING THE MASK  REGULARLY IS THE  RIGHT THING TO  DO. AND AGAIN, I AM  WATCHING REALLY  CLOSELY WHAT ARE  WE SEEING WITH  INTERACTIONS  OVERALL ACROSS  NOW TWO MONTHS. THE RULES HAVE  EVOLVED OVER TWO  MONTHS, BUT THE  REALITY OF  DEALING WITH A  CORONAVIRUS AND  THE POLICE ROLE  IN THE  CORONAVIRUS  CRISIS, OVER TWO  MONTHS WE\'VE SEEN VERY FEW  INCIDENTS. PEOPLE SAY, OH,  IT\'S GETTING  WARMER, BE  CAREFUL, BE  WORRIED ABOUT  THAT. I\'LL TELL YOU,  JEFF, FROM THE  VERY BEGINNING OF MY  ADMINISTRATION,  PEOPLE HAVE  WARNED ME ABOUT  THE WARMER MONTHS AND I THINK IT\'S  SOMETHING TO TAKE SERIOUSLY. I KNOW I TAKE IT  SERIOUSLY, BUT I  DON\'T WANT TO  OVERRATE IT  EITHER, BECAUSE  THE WORLD HAS  CHANGED IN A LOT  OF WAYS BEFORE  THIS PANDEMIC. THE REALITY OF  POLICING IN THE  CITY HAS CHANGED  PROFOUNDLY, THE  REALITY OF THE  CITY HAS CHANGED  PROFOUNDLY. THE SUMMERS ARE  NOT WHAT THEY  USED TO BE IN THE CITY. I REMEMBER WHEN  SUMMER WAS  EQUATED WITH JUST VAST AMOUNTS OF  CRIME AND  VIOLENCE AND  TENSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES AND  TENSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES AND  POLICE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN  RECENT YEARS IN  THE CITY. AND THE PANDEMIC  CUTS BOTH WAYS. THERE\'S CHANGE  AND IT\'S CLEARLY  CREATED A LOT OF  FRUSTRATION AND  CHALLENGES. IT\'S ALSO CHANGED PEOPLE\'S  LIFESTYLES  PROFOUNDLY AND  IT\'S CREATED  UNITY AND  PURPOSEFULNESS  ABOUT LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER. A LOT FEWER  PEOPLE ON THE  STREET TO BE  POLICED. SO I DON\'T THINK  IT\'S A SIMPLE  EQUATION THAT  SAYS WE\'RE ONLY  GOING IN ONE  DIRECTION. I THINK WE HAVE  TO GIVE CLEAR  GUIDANCE IN OUR  OFFICERS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND  WE WILL DO THAT. BUT I THINK THE  VAST MAJORITY OF  INTERACTIONS  BETWEEN OUR  POLICE AND  COMMUYE P   EFFECTIVE AND I  HAVE FAITH THAT  WILL T TO  BE THE CASE. >> HELLO, MAYOR,  AND EVERYONE. I\'M JUST  WONDERING IF YOU  HAD A RESPONSE TO THE CONTROLLER\'S  REPORT YESTERDAY  ESTIMATING AS  MANY AS 900,000  PEOPLE COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS, AND  COULD I SEND IT  BACK TO GLORIA  FOR HERS? >> A GOOD  APPROACH, BUT I\'M NOT GOING TO GET  INTO IT TODAY. IF GLORIA HAD  SENT YOU THE  QUESTION, THAT\'S  GREAT. BUT WE\'RE NOT  GOING TO BRING  HER BACK ON THE  LINE. SO IF YOU HAVE A  SECOND QUESTION,  ASK IT NOW,  KATHLEEN. >> THAT\'S OKAY. THAT\'S WHAT I\'VE  GOT. IF YOU COULD JUST FOCUS ON THE  REPORT, I WOULD  GREATLY  APPRECIATE IT.  >> GREAT. SO KATHLEEN,  LOOK, IT\'S A  STAGGERING  NUMBER. THINK ABOUT THIS  IN HUMAN TERMS. THAT\'S SO MANY  FAMILIES THAT NOW ARE LEFT IN  DOUBLE FOR THEIR  FUTURE. THAT\'S SO MANY  PEOPLE WHO ARE  NOT GOING TO HAVE MONEY FOR THE  BASICS IN THEIR  LIVES. THAT\'S SO MUCH  PAIN THAT COMES  WITH THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR  THAT NUMBER, IT\'S JUST  UNBELIEVABLE. I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONTROLLER  DID THIS REPORT. IT IS SOBERING. LOOK, WE HAVE  BEEN PREPARING  FOR THIS REALITY  NOW FOR THE LAST  TWO MONTHS. IT\'S WHY JUST  EARLIER THIS  WEEK, I SAID WE  ARE NOW RAMPING  UP OUR FOOD  PROGRAM TO BE  ABLE TO FEED A  MILLION PEOPLE A  DAY. THINK ABOUT THAT, A MILLION MEALS A DAY. UNFORTUNATELY,  IT\'S A WHOLE NEW  REALITY. CERTAINLY THE  POINT ON THE  HUMAN SUFFERING  HAPPENING IN THIS CITY, BUT IT PUTS A PROFOUND POINT  ON WHY WE NEED  FEDERAL AID AND  QUICKLY. BECAUSE THE  SITUATION IS  GETTING WORSE ALL THE T AND  BECAUSEPLE  AFNG A BECAUHE  AIO THE  CITY TO REACH  PEOPLE IS GETTING STRAINED. WE\'RE GOING TO  USE EVERYTHING WE HAVE, BUT IT\'S  GETTING STRAINED  EVERY ADDITIONAL  TIME SOMEONE  LOSES THEIR JOB. IT\'S MORE AND  MORE NEED THAT  GETS CREATED. SO I TAKE THAT  NUMBER VERY  SERIOUSLY. WE\'RE GOING TO  BUILD EVERYTHING  ON THE ASSUMPTION OF THAT NUMBER  AND IT COULD GET  WORSE. WE\'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR EVERY  NEW YORKER. LIKE I SAID, THE  FOCUS WILL BE  HEALTH, SAFETY,  FOOD AND SHELTER. THAT\'S WHERE  WE\'RE GOING TO  KEEP OUR FOCUS,  WHATEVER THE  NUMBER OF  UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE BECOMES. BUT IF EVER  THERE\'S EVIDENCE  WHY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENNES  EP   NOW. WE\'VE LITERALLY  NEVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE IT  IN THEIR  LIFETIMES," THIS  MANY PEOPLE  BECOMING  UNEMPLOYED THIS  QUICKLY. SO WE NEED A MUCH BIGGER RESPONSE  TO BE ABLE TO  PROTECT PEOPLE  GOING FORWARD. >> ANNA FROM  """"DAILY NEWS"""" IS  UP NEXT. >> HEY",  MR. MAYOR, I LIKE YOUR HAIRCUT.  >> THANK YOU,  ANNA.  >> I JUST WANTED  TO GET AN UPDATE. HOW MANY  CORONAVIRUS TESTS ARE BEING  CONDUCTED IN NEW  YORK CITY TODAY  ON AVERAGE? LAST WEEK WHEN I  CHECKED IT WAS  ABOUT 14,000 AND  WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS DAY. WHAT ARE WE AT? >> THEY\'RE AT THE SAME 13,0,14,000 RANGE. THE LAST I  CHECKED, A DAY OR TWO AGO. WE WILL KEEP  UPDATING ON A  REGULAR BASIS. AND WE NEED A  BREAKTHROUGH,  MEANING WE NEED  THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO  COME IN TO HELP  WITH LAB  CAPACITY. SO LET\'S SAY  WE\'RE AROUND  13,000. THE FACT IS WE  WOULD LIKE TO BE  INITIALLY, YOU  KNOW, TENS OF  THOUSANDS A DAY,  I WANT TO GET TO  30,0,40,0,50,000 A DAY AS  QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE. WE WOULDO TO  GET HIGHER THAN  THAT. NOW, THE ANTIBODY TESTING IS COMING INTO PLAY NOW  MORE AND MORE AND THAT\'S CERTAINLY  HELPFUL. SO THE NUMBERS  WE\'RE TALKING  ABOUT, THE PCR  AND DIAGNOSTIC  TEST, WHICH STILL ARE THE SINGLE  MOST VALUABLE  TOOL WE HAVE IN  THE TEST AND  TRACE PROGRAM. BUT EVEN WITH THE IMPERFECTIONS OF  ANTIBODY TESTING, WE\'RE GOING TO  USE THAT  INFORMATION AND  IT\'S GOING TO  CONTRIBUTE TO  WHAT WE DO IN  TERMS OF TESTING, TRACING,  QUARANTINING AND  MAKING DECISIONS  ABOUT HOW  INDIVIDUALS CAN  ENGAGE THEIR  WORKPLACE OR NOT. IT\'S ANOTHER  PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE\'RE GOING TO  USE. WE\'VE OBVIOUSLY  STARTED WITHOUT  HAVING ANY  TESTING AND WE  HAD TO BASE  THINGS ON  PEOPLE\'S  SYMPTOMS. THAT\'S ANOTHER  PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE CAN WORK WITH. BUT TO GET THESE  TEST NUMBERS UP  REALLY CLOSER TO  WHERE WE WANT TO  BE, WE\'VE GOT TO  GET A LOT MORE  LAB CAPACITY. WE NOW HAVE THE  SELF-SWAB TEST  APPROACH WHICH IS EASIER AND  FASTER, BUT WE  NEED THE LAB  CAPACITY FOR  WHATEVER IT IS,  WE NEED THE LAB  CAPACITY TO  REALLY INCREASE  AND THAT\'S WHAT  WE\'RE WORKING ON  RIGHT NOW. SO I AM VERY  HOPEFUL IN THE  COMING DAYS WE\'LL PULL ALL OF THESE STRANDS TOGETHER  AND WE\'LL BE ABLE TO PUT UP REAL  NUMBERS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DO  THE TEST AND  TRACE WE NEED TO. BUT THERE\'S  DEFINITELY MORE  WORK TO DO ON THE LABS. >> HELLO, MAYOR,  HOW ARE YOU? >> I\'M DOING  GREAT.  >> TWO QUICK  QUESTIONS, THE  NEW OPEN STREETS  THAT YOU JUST  ANNOUNCED ARE  JUST ALMOST  ENTIRELY ALL OF  THEM BEING  OVERSEEN BY  BUSINESS GROUPS. AS YOU KNOW, THE  CITY\'S EFFORT TO  GET 100 MILES  WILL INVOLVE  COMMUNITY GROUPS  AND RESIDENTS TO  CREATE THE OPEN  SPACE UNDER  GUIDELINES ASKING FOR SERIOUS  COMMITMENTS IN  TERMS OF STAFFING AND MONITORING  THE SPACE. TODAY\'S  ANNOUNCEMENT,  THERE WAS A  POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE ONLY  COMMUNITIES TO  GET THE VIETLY  IMPORTANT OPEN  STREETS PROGRAM  BE THOSE THAT  HAVE IMPROVEMENT  DISTRICTS OR  NEIGHBORHOOD  ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAPPEN TO HAVE  THE LUXURY OF NOT BEING PREOCCUPIED FOR MATTERS OF  LIFE AND DEATH  FOR ESSENTIAL  WORKERS IN THOSE  COMMUNITIES. AND THE FINAL  QUESTION IS I  NOTICE YOU  FINALLY DECIDED  TO INCLUDE  TRANSPORTATION AS ONE OF YOUR  RECOVERY PANELS,  SO I WANTED TO  KNOW ABOUT THAT.  >> SURE. ON THE FIRST  POINT, GARTH, SO  NO, THIS IS THE  BEGINNING. WE EXPECT TO BE  IN EVERY KIND OF  COMMUNITY. IN FACT, YOU\'LL  REMEMBER THAT  WHEN THE IDEA  FIRST CAME UP,  THE CENTRAL  CONCERN WAS HOW  DO WE DO IT  SAFELY, WILL WE  HAVE THE RIGHT  KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT AND  STRUCTURES. AS WE HAVE BEEN  WORKING WITH THIS MODEL, WE\'RE  FINDING DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET IT  DONE THAT WE  BELIEVE ARE SAFE  AND COME WITH  STRUCTURE. SO I REALLY WANT  TO EMPHASIZE MY  CONCERN FROM THE  BEGINNING WAS  NEEDING  STRUCTURE,  NEEDING  ENFORCEMENT,  NEEDING SAFETY. AS WE\'RE GETTING  DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO IT, WE\'RE  FINDING MORE WAYS OF DOING THAT,  AND THAT\'S GREAT. WE ALSO SAID FROM THE BEGINNING  THIS HAD TO BE  SOMETHING THAT  FOCUSED ON WHERE  THE NEED WAS  GREATEST, WHERE  THIS KIND OF  APPROACH WOULD  BENEFIT THE MOST. AND WHEN WE  WORKED WITH THE  CITY COUNCIL ON  THE RECENT  PACKAGE, ONE OF  THE STRANDS WAS  FOCUS ON  COMMUNITIES THAT  HAVE BEEN HIT BY  THE DISEASE  HARDEST, ANOTHER  OF COURSE FOCUS  ON THE AREAS  AROUND PARKS, AND THEN PARKS THE  DEMAND WAS  GROWING WITH THE  WARMER WEATHER. SO THESE  EXAMPLES, THEY  ARE JUST THE  BEGINNING. YOU\'RE GOING TO  SEE THESE KIND OF OPEN STREETS IN  ALL FIVE BOROUGHS MORE AND MORE AND YOU\'RE GOING TO  SEE DIFFERENT  KINDS OF  ORGANIZATIONS TO  HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HELP MAKE THEM WORK AND GIVE  STRUCTURE JOINING INTO IT. WE\'LL ANNOUNCE  THEM AS THEY COME TOGETHER. IN TERMS OF THE  ADVISORY PANEL,  YOU RAISED A  COUPLE OF GOOD  POINTS AND SOME  OF YOUR  COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDIA DID, TOO,  ABOUT WHAT IT\'S  GOING TO MEAN FOR THE FUTURE TO  COME BACK  DIFFERENTLY IN  THIS CITY IN  TERMS OF ISSUES  OF  TRANSPORTATION. WHEN WE PUT  TOGETHER THE  PANELS, WE WERE  THINKING ABOUT  THE IMMEDIATE  RESTART ISSUES,  AND OBVIOUSLY  SOME OF THE  ISSUES AROUND  TRANSPORTATION  ARE GOING TO BE  DICTATED BY  LARGER REALITIES  THAT ARE  DIFFERENT THAN  WHAT\'S HAPPENING, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SMALL BUSINESS. A CERTAIN AMOUNT  OF OUR  TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEM -- A LOT  OF OUR  TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEM HAS  CONTINUED  UNABATED BECAUSE  IT HAD TO. SO IT\'S A  DIFFERENT  REALITY. IT\'S NOT THE  RESTART WE\'LL GO  THROUGH WITH  SMALL BUSINESS. BUT WE PUT THE  GROUP TOGETHER  BECAUSE EVEN  THOUGH IT\'S LESS  ABOUT THE  RESTART, IT\'S  VERY IMPORTANT TO WHAT HAPPENS IN  THE MONTHS  THEREAFTER. AND WE WANT TO  START PLANNING  NOW, AND AGAIN  SOME OF THE  QUESTIONS I WANT  TO THANK YOU, AND I WANT TO THANK  YOUR COLLEAGUES  WHO RAISED THIS  POINT ABOUT, IS  THIS AN  INFLECTION POINT, IS THIS A MOMENT  TO RETHINK HOW WE GET AWAY FROM TOO MUCH DEPENDENCE  ON CARS? AND THE ANSWER IS YES. WE NEED TO SEE  THIS AS A  TRANSFORMATIONAL  MOMENT, EVEN WITH ALL THE PAIN AND  EVEN WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES. WE ARE NOT GOING  TO BRING NEW YORK CITY BACK THE WAY IT WAS. WE\'RE GOING TO  BRING IT BACK IN  SOME WAYS THAT  ARE DIFFERENT AND BETTER. AND BECAUSE WE\'RE IN A  TRANSFORMATIONAL  MOMENT, WE CAN  RETHINK SOME  THINGS AND DO  THEM VERY  DIFFERENTLY. SO WHAT I WANT TO SEE FROM THIS  GROUP -- AGAIN,  LESS ABOUT THE  IMMEDIATE RESTART DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE IN THE  COMING WEEKS,  MORE ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE  MONTHS AND YEARS  AHEAD. I WANT IDEAS ON  HOW WE MAXIMIZE  MASS TRANSIT,  MINIMIZE THE USE  OF THE  AUTOMOBILE, THINK ABOUT THIS IN  TERMS OF FIGHTING GLOBAL WARMING  AND POLLUTION AND THINK ABOUT THIS  IN TERMS OF  FIGHTING  CONGESTION. THINK IN IT IN  TERMS OF EQUITY  FOR COMMUNITIES  AND REALLY HELP  US TAKE A BIG  JUMP FORWARD BY  THE END OF THIS  ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE  APPROACH ISSUES  OF TRANSPORTATION WITH AN IDEA ON  THE FUTURE. >> JULIA FROM THE POST.  >> GOOD MORNING. TWO SEPARATE  QUESTIONS FOR  YOU, MR. MAYOR. ONE IS A  FOLLOW-UP ON THE  FURLOUGHS AND  LAYOFFS. ARE YOU WILLING  TO SACRIFICE  FIRST RESPONDERS, TEACHERS AND  HEALTH CARE  WORKERS WITHOUT  FIRST MAKING  SPENDING CUTS  IDENTIFIED BY  CONTROLLER  STRAYER, PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE  PROVEN RESULTS  SUCH AS DRIVE NYC AND UNNECESSARY  CONTRACTS. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION IS A  FOLLOW-UP TO WHAT YOU SAID ON TV  THIS MORNING  ABOUT NURSING  HOMES. YOU SAID THAT  SOME COVID  PATIENTS SHOULD  GO BACK TO THE  FACILITIES  BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHERE THEY\'RE  KNOWN. BUT HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IF  THEY\'RE ALSO  EXPOSING OTHER  VULNERABLE  ELDERLY RESIDENTS TO THE DISEASE? SHOULDN\'T THERE  BE ALTERNATIVE  FACILITIES THEY  CAN GO TO HELP  PREVENT THE  SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS? >> JULIA, AS I\'VE TALKED TO OUR  HEALTH CARE  LEADERS, THERE  HAS BEEN A  RECOGNITION THAT  THIS IS A COMPLEX QUESTION. IT\'S NOT A SIMPLE QUESTION OF  SAYING THAT THE  BEST THINGS FOR  SENIORS ARE  ALWAYS TO SEND  THEM INTO A  HOSPITAL SETTING. WHAT I THINK I  WOULD SAY IS WE  NEED SOME REAL  SERIOUS CHANGES  IN THE APPROACH  TO NURSING HOMES. ALTHOUGH THE CITY DOESN\'T HAVE A  DIRECT ROLE IN  NURSING HOMES AND BECAUSE I DON\'T  EXPERIENCE THESE  ISSUES BECAUSE WE DON\'T REGULATE  THE NURSING  HOMES, WHAT I\'M  SEEING ON A HUMAN LEVEL IS  UNACCEPTABLE. AND OBVIOUSLY THE CITY HAS TRIED IN EVERY WAY WE CAN  TO HELP THE  NURSING HOMES IN  THE LAST TWO  MONTHS, TO GET  THEM PPE AND  PROVIDE WHATEVER  SUPPORT WE CAN. BUT I THINK THIS  CRISIS IS  POINTING OUT THAT WE NODE A  DIFFERENT  APPROACH GOING  FORWARD. A LOT OF THEM ARE FOR-PROFIT  ENTERPRISES. IF THAT MODEL IS  GOING TO BE  CONTINUED, IT\'S  OBVIOUSLY GOING  TO NEED MORE  RIGOROUS  STANDARDS GOING  FORWARD. BUT ON THE  SPECIFIC QUESTION OF WHERE SHOULD  THE SENIOR BE IF, GOD FOR BID, THEY CONTRACT COVID,  FIRST OF ALL, A  DOCTOR HAS TO  DECIDE THAT. SECOND OF ALL, I  DO UNDERSTAND  THAT YOU HAVE TO  THINK ABOUT THE  TOTALITY OF THAT  SENIOR\'S LIFE. AND FOR MANY  SENIORS IN  NURSING HOMES TO  BE AWAY FROM THAT PLACE COULD BE  PROBLEMATIC IN A  WHOLE HOST OF  OTHER WAYS. I THINK THE  QUESTION IS CAN  THE NURSING HOME  SUPPORT THAT  INDIVIDUAL WHILE  KEEPING EVERYONE  ELSE SAFE. IF THEY CAN,  THAT\'S A VIABLE  OPTION. IF THEY CAN\'T, OF COURSE THE SENIOR SHOULD NOT BE  THERE. BUT I THINK IT\'S  UP TO DOCTORS AND IT\'S ABOUT EACH  INDIVIDUAL CASE. ON THE SECOND  POINT, WE\'RE  GOING TO JUST  DISAGREE FROM THE BEGINNING,  RESPECTFULLY, AND I RESPECT THE  CONTROLLER, DON\'T AGREE WITH HIM ON SOME THINGS AS  WELL, AS TO WHICH INITIATIVES ARE  HAVING WHICH  IMPACT ON PEOPLE. ANYTHING THAT\'S  ABOUT HEALTH AND  SAFETY IS A  PRIORITY, WHETHER IT\'S PHYSICAL  HEALTH, MENTAL  HEALTH, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  HEALTH, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  SAFETY, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  SHELTER AND FOOD  RIGHT NOW. SO I\'M GOING TO  LOOK AT THE  ENTIRE BUDGET AND FOR THE DURATION  OF THIS CRIES I\'M GOING TO TAKE A  LOOK THROUGH THAT PRISM. I SAID EARLIER  I\'M NOT GOING TO  START PROJECTING  WHAT WE HAVE TO  DO IN TERMS OF  THE BUDGET. I\'M SAYING THAT  WE ARE MISSING  $7.5 BILLION NOW  AND THEN ADD THE  PROJECTIONS THAT  THE CONTROLLER  JUST GAVE US ON  UNEMPLOYMENT,  WHICH MEANS  HORRIBLE THINGS  FOR WORKING  PEOPLE AND  FAMILIES, BUT IT  ALSO MEANS LESS  AND LESS REVENUE  ON TOP OF THAT  FOR THE CITY. IF OUR REVENUE  PICTURE CONTINUES TO GET WORSE AND  WORSE, NOT JUST  FOR THE NEXT  FISCAL YEAR, BUT  FOR THE ONE AFTER THAT, TOO. AND IF THEY\'RE  THREATENED FROM  POTENTIAL CUTS  FROM THE STATE  LEVEL BECAUSE THE STATE HAS RUN OUT OF MONEY, WE\'RE  GOING TO HAVE TO  DO PAINFUL THINGS AND EVERY OPTION  WILL BE ON THE  TABLE. THE RIGHT WAY TO  DO IT, THE FAIR  WAY TO DO IT IS  FOR THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO  STEP IN AND BAIL  OUT CITIES AND  STATES ALL OVER  THE COUNTRY IN  EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS  HURTING. EVERY PLACE  THAT\'S LOST  REVENUE, NOT ANY  FAULT OF THEIR  OWN, DESERVES TO  SEE THAT REVENUE  REPLACED. THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT CAN DO IT. I KEEP SAYING  THEY FOUND $58  BILLION  EFFORTLESSLY FOR  THE AIRLINE CITY, WHY ARE THEY NOT  HELPING CITIES  AND STATES GET  BACK ON THEIR  FEET. THAT\'S WHAT WE\'RE FIGHTING FOR AND  I THINK THERE\'S A GROUNDSWELL OF  SUPPORT,  INCLUDING FROM  REPUBLICAN  MAYORS. IF WE DON\'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN  WASHINGTON, ANY  AND ALL OPTIONS  WILL BE ON THE  TABLE.  >> MAYOR, I JUST  WANTED TO ASK YOU TWO QUICK THINGS, IF I COULD,  PLEASE. I DIDN\'T QUITE  UNDERSTAND WHAT  YOU AND IF STEVE  BANKS WANTS TO  CLARIFY FOR YOU,  THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE  NUMBER OF  HOMELESS PEOPLE  ON THE SUBWAY  THIS MORNING AND  WHAT YOUR TALLY  IS, THE  DIFFERENCES --  AND I THINK STEVE USED TO WORK  TRANSIENT, IF WE  WERE JUST ON THE  SUBWAY CATCHING A RIDE AND HANGING  OUT, THEY\'RE NOT  COUNTED IN YOUR  TALLY, AND WHAT  YOU\'RE SAYING IS  UPON INTERVIEWING THEM YOU  DETERMINE THEY  ARE LONG-TERM  BASICALLY LIVING  ON THE SUBWAY. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION TO YOU,  MAYOR, I JUST  WANTED TO GET  YOUR THOUGHTS ON  THE PRESIDENT  ANNOUNCING  YESTERDAY THAT  THE WHITE HOUSE  CORONAVIRUS   FORCE  GOING TO BE GOING AWAY  SOMETIME AROUND  MEMORIAL DAY. THAT SEEMS KIND  OF EARLY.  >> YEAH. TRUER WORDS AIN\'T NEVER BEEN SPOKE. IT SURE AS HELL  DOES SEEM KIND OF EARLY. I DON\'T  UNDERSTAND IT. MEMORIAL DAY IS  RIGHT AROUND THE  CORNER. I DO NOT  UNDERSTAND WH HE THINKING. I CHK THIS  MORNING AND MY  UNDERSTANDING IS  THAT THERE ARE  SEVERAL STATES  WHEREHE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING  MARKEDLY. THIS IS -- WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE  WOODS BY ANY  STRETCH OF THE  IMAGINATION. SO THANK GOD  THINGS ARE  GETTING BETTER IN NEW YORK CITY,  BUT WE STI HAV A LONG WAY TO GO. THAT FEAR OF THE  BOOMERANG IS  SOMETHING  EVERYONE SHOULD  BE HAVING ON  THEIR MINDS UNTIL YOU ARE SURE THIS DISEASE HAS BEEN  FOUGHT BACK DOWN  TO THE POINT THAT WE CALL LOW-LEVEL TRANSMISSION  WHERE THERE\'S SO  FEW CASES YOU CAN TRACE EVERY  SINGLE ONE AND  ALL THEIR  CONTACTS. UNTIL THAT POINT, NO ONE SHOULD  BREATHE EASY. AND THE NUMBER OF CASES AREN\'T  GOING DOWN. IF YOU\'VE GOT  PARTS OF THE  COUNTRY WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP, THAT\'S A  PROFOUND DANGER  AND IT WILL START TO SPREAD  ELSEWHERE. SO THIS IS FAR  FROM OVER. I DO NOT  UNDERSTAND WHAT  HE\'S THINKING. WE SHOULD TREAT  THIS AS THE  NATIONAL  EMERGENCY IT IS. THE PRES  NES   UNDERSTA   CORONAVIRUS I G AW  RIGHT AWAY, NO  MATTER HOW MUCH  HE WISHES IT WAS. HE NEEDS TO  UNDERSTAND THAT  THE THINGS WE  COULD DO TO  ACTUALLY FIGHT  THE CORONAVIRUS  WOULD BE TO GIVE  US TESTING AND HE STILL HASN\'T DONE IT. HE NEEDS TO  UNDERSTAND IF WE  WANT TO START  RECOVERY, HE  NEEDS THE HELP TO CITIES AND STATES AND AS OF LAST  NIGHT, HE IS MORE INTERESTING IN  HELPING RICH  PEOPLE GET A  BREAK ON THEIR  CAPITAL GAINS TAX THAN HE IS TO  PROVIDING RELIEF  TO NEW YORK CITY  AND OTHER STATES  AROUND THE  COUNTRY.

Andrew Cuomo Holds Coronavirus Briefing | NBC News",NBC News,isCJqa9lugk,"[""a painfully slow decline but it's better than the the numbers going the other way you see it on total hospitalizations you see it on intubations and you see it also in the number of new cases per day this is important because while we're seeing that hospitalization rate go down and you see the number of new cases going down those number of new cases are still problematic right so it means 600 new cases yesterday with everything we've done we still have 600 new cases yesterday either walking in the door to hospitals or people who are in hospitals who were then diagnosed with Kovac but that number is also going down one of the most stubborn situations and the most distressing or the number of deaths and that is down from where we were but it's still 232 yesterday which is an unimaginable and painful reality that we have to deal with and when people talk about how good things are going and the decline and the progress that's all true it's also true that 232 people were lost yesterday and that's 232 families that are suffering today also a caution and the number of deaths I know the reporters and everyone likes to trace these numbers and document these numbers I think we're going to find when all is said and done that the numbers are much different than we actually thought they were the amount of information that is now coming out that changes what we believed or what we were told happens almost on a daily basis this was a virus virus that started in China now last week the CDC says oh it didn't come from China it actually came from Europe to the East Coast that's how it got to New York and that's how we got to Chicago etc that by the time we turned off travel from China the China travel ban the virus was already gone and it was in Europe and then it came here from Europe and we didn't know at the time so February March flights were landing people coming from Italy from the UK etc they were bringing the virus we didn't know they're now saying that the virus may not have come just in February March the virus may have come late last year they're doing testing in Chicago now on people who passed last November in December to see if they passed from the kovat virus so I think this is all going to change over time so a note of caution and I think it's going to be worse when the final numbers are tallied we're also not fully documenting all the at-home deaths that may be attributable to COBIT so I think that the reality is going to be actually worse but there's no doubt it's a time of unprecedented anxiety stress people want answers people want answers now haven't had a paycheck they don't know where their job is they don't know if they're going back to work where they're going back to work when they're going back to work and they want answers now and I understand that fully but before we look for answers let's make sure we're all understanding the same question right and the question here is not do we open or reopen the society when do we reopen it we have to reopen the society you know asking when do you start breathing you have to breathe right the economy must function people need incomes the economy has to work state needs revenues people have to be able to live their lives you have to be able to get out of the house you have to be able to see friends you have to be able to see family so it's not a question of do we reopen it's a question of how we reopen that's really the question that we have to grapple with and that we're dealing with in New York our position in New York is the answer to the question how do we reopen is by following facts and data as opposed to emotion and politics right everyone has emotion I want to go back to work today I'm gonna go see my family today I want to be able to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks and socialize with my friends today I do by the way but it's not about emotion it's not about political position on reopening there's no Democratic position Republican position this virus kills Democrats Republicans there's no politics to this deal with facts and deal with data and use that to instruct you even more important at a time of high emotion understand the emotion appreciate the emotion but deal on the facts and the data and you have it you can calibrate by the number of hospitalizations the infection rate the number of deaths the percentage of hospital capacity the percentage that you're finding an antibody test the percentage of finding on diagnostic tests positive negative you're collecting tracing data make your decisions based on the information and the data that's what we're saying in New York that that actually works and by the way we know it works when you looked there's a chart today that was published by the New York Times you look at what's happening in New York yes our our line is going down our number of cases is going down we have turned the corner and we're on the decline you take New York out of the national numbers the numbers for the rest of the nation are going up they are going up to me that vindicates what we're doing here in New York which says follow the science follow the data put the politics aside and the emotion aside what we're doing here shows results the hospitalization rate is down the number of deaths is down and the number of new case since then for me I've been focusing on this number of new cases that's where our health professionals are focused why because with everything we've done close schools close businesses everybody shelter at home all the precautions about wear a mask wear gloves etc you still have 600 new cases that walked in the door yesterday week before that we still still saw one thousand new cases every day where are those new cases still coming from because we've done everything we can to close down how are you still generating 600 new cases every day where are they coming from again let's look at the facts let's look at the data let's understand and see what we can do so what we've done over the past few days is we ask hospitals look at just those new cases who are coming in right yesterday 600 new cases where are those people coming from and what can we learn from those people to further target and refine our strategy when you look at where they're coming from they're primarily coming from downstate New York which is not surprising basically equally distributed Long Island is is 18 percent so that's a number that jumps out at you Rockland and Westchester which is where we did have a problem that's down to 11 percent when you look at the racial breakdown of who's getting hospitalized you see it's disproportionately minorities disproportionately african-american and Latino again in downstate New York higher percentage male 52 48 we don't know exactly why but the virus doesn't discriminate generally and a very high percentage comorbidities which is what we've been talking about in which we understand which is not a surprise this is a surprise overwhelmingly the people were at home where there's been a lot of speculation about this a lot of people again had a a lot of people have been arguing where they come from and wherever we should be focusing but if you notice 18 percent of the people came from nursing homes less than 1% came from jail or prison 2 percent came from the homeless population 2 percent from other congregate facilities but 66 percent of the people were at home which is shocking to us disproportionately older but by the way older starts at 51 years old I'm a little sensitive on this point but if older starts at 51 years old then that's a large number of us old folk in this in this state in in this country so that whole vulnerable population being old well old is now 51 and up so think about that 60 to 70 twenty percent seventy to eighty nineteen percent but fifty-one years old is old okay and I am very old transportation method we thought maybe they were taking public transportation and we've taken special precautions on public transportation but actually no because these people were literally at home two percent took our services nine percent were driving their own vehicle only four percent were taking public transportation two percent were walking eighty four percent were at home literally were they working no they were retired or they were unemployed only 17 percent working so that says they're not working they're not traveling the predominantly downstate predominantly minority predominantly older predominantly non-essential employees and that's important we were thinking that maybe we were going to fire find a higher percentage of essential employees who were getting sick because they were going to work that these may be nurses doctors transit workers that's not the case and they were predominantly at home so now that's only three days that's just about a hundred hospitals 1,000 people but it reinforces what we've been saying which is much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself everything is closed down government has done everything it could Society has done everything it could now it's up to you are you wearing the mask are you doing the hand sanitizer if you have younger people who are visiting you and may be out there and maybe less diligent with the social distancing are you staying away from older people oh they're starting at 51 by the way and but it comes down to personal behavior this is not a group that we can target with this information it's really about personal behavior another issue that we're looking at and we're trying to understand and what is happening in these hotspot clusters that you see popping up you see it happening across the country in meat plants where you have a significant number of people getting infected and there's now a meat shortage in the nation well we have a hot spot in New York State we have a hot spot in upstate New York Madison all-nighter counties and it's around an agricultural business but it's not a meat processing plant it's actually a greenhouse farm and we have dozens of cases coming from the employees in this situation so what does that tell you well it's not really about meat or vegetables right there's nothing about the fact that it was a meat processing plant because we have a vegetable processing plant it is about worker density and large gatherings that's the caution flag here that's an the message it's not about poultry it's not about me it's not about vegetables it's when you run a facility with a large number of workers and advance environment and we learned that already in New York when we had the New Rochelle hotspot which was the first hotspot in the nation New Rochelle Westchester and the lesson was one or two people infected who go to a large gathering or a dense gathering that virus just takes off on you and we learned that in New Rochelle they're learning it again in meat processing plants and poultry processing plants across the nation and we just went through it again in and we're going through it now and Madison and Oneida County so that's something that we have to watch and keep in mind also at the same time that we're going through this reopening exercise I want to make sure we don't miss the opportunity in the moment and the opportunity in the moment is that we went all through this let's learn the lessons and let's take this moment in history to actually improve from where we are and to build back better I want to set the bar high and set the goal of not just replacing what we did okay everybody go back to where we were I don't want to say that we spent all this time all this pain all this suffering lost all these deaths only we'll go back to where we were go back to a better place how do you take how do you find the silver lining in this viral storm and actually improve your situation we're on Long Island we went through superstorm sandy was horrendous thousands of people displaced but we learned and we built back better Long Island is better for having gone through Hurricane sandy well how can you say that because it's a fact we learned we improved from a horrendous situation well how do we do that here and that's part of what we want to do you know people talk about making changes in society change is very hard to make change is hard in your own personal life right how many new year solutions that we make as a society that are still in effect here in May right I was supposed to lose five pounds I was supposed to be running every day I was supposed to never lose my temper forget it that one week maybe ten days for the temper the but history does show that people are ready for change at certain moments and I believe this is one of those moments like the superstorm sandy like a 911 like we've seen after natural disasters around the country where people say I get it and I'm ready to make changes and that's what we want to do and that's what we talk about when we said look it's not just about reopening it's about rebuilding it's literally about reimagining and moving the state forward at this moment and we want to do that how do we come up with a better transportation system how do we have more social equity in society a better safety system better housing better economy better education better health care system and we need the best minds available to take this moment to put together with the best thinking that we can find to make the best improvement one of the lessons is in public health and our hospital system we worked in an impossible situation when this started we were told that we may need 130,000 hospital beds for kovat that was the initial projections we only have 50,000 hospital beds in the state how do you get 50,000 hospital beds to a 130,000 capacity it was impossible and by the way we don't really have a public health system we have separate hospitals all across the state but they don't really function as one system they never really work together on a day to day basis they don't share patient load they don't share PPE how do you do that and we scrambled and we made it work but now how do we institutionalize that and how are we ready for the next kovat or the next whatever it is how do we use telemedicine better how do we better you allocate our health resources how do we harden the healthcare system but let's take the lessons we just learned and institutionalize it and we've asked Michael Dowling to do that he was a big part of the Scramble that we went through to make it work and northwell was a leader it's the largest and in my opinion the most innovative but now how do we take that and institutionalize it so we don't have to go through this again so next time something like this happens we can just open a book and it says here's what we do step a step B step C and we want to thank Michael for his service with that and he'll be working with dr. Zucker from the Department of Health another area is education we went to remote learning overnight that's what happens when you close the schools okay all the students go home we're gonna go to remote learning what is remote learning and we weren't really ready for it we had all talked about it thought about it there was some but we were not really prepared to do it we then had to do it we implemented it and God bless the teachers in this state they did a phenomenal job and God bless parents who had to figure out quickly how to use computers and technology and zoom this and zoom that but how do we really learn those lessons and we went to Bill Gates and he's going to work with us on reimagining the education system and I want to thank him very much how do you create a testing and tracing system by the way what is a testing and tracing system right we never did this before well we have to take thousands of kovat tests antibody tests diagnostic diagnostic tests and then we have to trace have an army of tracers to do this we're doing it for the first time ever but how do we learn and institutionalize it yes we have to do this for Kovac but we're not going to go through all of this trouble and then just forget it this will happen again some people say this virus comes back in the fall or the winter or there'll be another health emergency but Michael Bloomberg has generously said that he would work with us and use his philanthropy to develop that testing and tracing and then on a larger scale how do we really use new technology in the economy of tomorrow and that's the lesson that we're all learning right worked from home telemedicine tellin it's all about technology and a better use of technology and really incorporating the lessons into that and the probably the best mind in this country if not in this on the globe to do this is I believe a true visionary especially in the field of technology and that's Eric Schmidt who was former CEO of Google obviously and just saw a future that no one else envisioned and then developed a way to get there and we've asked him to come work with us to bring that kind of visionary aspect to government and society let's look at what we just went through let's anticipate a future through that lens and tell us how we can incorporate these lessons and mr. Schmidt who has tremendous demands on his talent and his time has agreed to help us and had an effort to do this Eric thank you so much for doing this and thank you so much for being with us well thank you Thank You governor you have been doing an incredible job for our state and frankly for the nation and I'm really pleased to help the first priorities of what we're trying to do or focus on telehealth remote learning and broadband we can take this terrible disaster and accelerate all of those in ways that will make things much much better the solutions that we have to come up with have to help the people most in need people are in different situations throughout the state we need to consider all of them and not pick one or the other so the intent is to be very inclusive and make this thing better we need to look for solutions that can be presented now and accelerated and use technology to make things better my own view is that these moments are a chance to revisit things that are not getting enough attention and we have systems that need to be updating and need to be reviewed my commitment is to make this period this sort of awful period to be a period as you described in Long Island where New York State New York City everyone comes out stronger the public-private partnerships that are possible with the intelligence of the New Yorkers is extraordinary it needs to be unleashed you are the person to help us do that we are already where we're all in we are New Yorkers so we're aggressive about it and we're ambitious about it and I think we get it Eric you know we went through this period and we realized that change is not only imminent but it can actually be a friend I've done the right way and I hope that when we look back on this time we talk about all the pain or the suffering but we also say it was a moment in time where we came together and we brought a creative aspect and an innovative aspect and we work together in ways we never did before and we made this place a better place and I can't thank you enough for doing it Eric thank you very much I look forward to continuing the conversation and working together mr. Schmidt thank you yes thank you God thank you that is exciting last point today is National Nurses Day as you know nobody knows better than New Yorkers how our nurses really stepped up with our health care professionals you know when the pressure is on in our lives you wind up seeing the best and the worst in people and heroes rise to the occasion and that's what we saw here in the state of New York our frontline health care workers were just extraordinary showing up every day working impossible hours a virus that nobody understood fear of infection but they just kept rising to the horizon to the occasion and that's why New York and the nation just loves all our healthcare workers but our nurses especially have done a phenomenal job and we thank them from the bottom of hearts and JetBlue had a beautiful idea of a way to say thank you which is donating round-trip flights to 100,000 medical personnel and nurses to honor their efforts isn't that a beautiful thing 10,000 to New York medical professionals Michael darling doesn't is not eligible for that situation but other than that because we need him here in New York but it's a nice way that JetBlue is saying thank you and all of us will find our own way to say thank you but I'm sure every New Yorker joins me in saying thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of our heart and to all the nurses who are here today god bless you and thank you for getting us through this and thank you for being New York tough which is not just tough but smart and disciplined and unified and loving god bless you questions yes about reopening so along the way you've rubber-stamp some things that you could say make common sense like golf courses you know you asked about drive-in theaters you said hey that might be a good idea so if a business owner right now says I have a super creative way to do this I can do it immediately and be safe you talk about smart New Yorkers intelligent Yorkers do you trust that and you move forward with other things yeah piecemeal yeah we have we have a very detailed reopening plan with very detailed steps I touch on it in what we just talked about we look at different regions in the state because there are different situations in different regions right New York City is different than Long Island that's different than the Adirondacks is different than Buffalo New York and the numbers are just dramatically different the way we talk about in this nation states are in different places in this state regions are in different places that's how big this stadium is how diverse it is so there are specific factual data points that each region has to assess our is your infection rate going up or is it going down or your house correlations going up or your hospitalizations coming down do you have healthcare capacity if god forbid that infection rate takes off on you do you have the hospital capacity to deal with that do you have the ICU beds to deal with it you have the PPE if yes to those questions then in that region working with the local officials what businesses do we reopen and the analysis there is businesses that are most essential and pose the lowest risk should go first construction jobs because construction jobs especially exterior construction jobs workers are basically socially distanced by the nature of the work and can wear masks getting their construction industry up and running again manufacturing in a manufacturing setting where you can do social distancing right the meet plants are a caution flag the poultry plants are a caution flag the agriculture farm upstate is a caution flag not manufacturing where you have density and people three feet from each other on a factory line because that's a problem but manufacturing where you can socially distance and then you can even go business by business drive-in theater where an employer says this is how I'm going to operate it everybody stays in a car nobody gets out of a car you can make those decisions a book stores you could say maybe a laundromat know is that we get to that point and we have the steps where you go through the data because first of all you want to make sure you have the you want to make sure you have the virus on the retreat right you want to make sure you're not still seeing that virus like fire through dry grass and we do have the virus on retreat all across the state different levels of retreat in different parts of the state but it is on retreat in all parts of this state which is dramatically different than the numbers for the nation which is worth noting you have states that are opening where you still are in the incline I think that's a mistake regarde the spike in a homeless population in New York City do you think by cutting the advantage program you bear some responsibility for New York City's spike homeless increased funding for homeless all across the board local governments then decide what the best programs are for that locality it's different or not so different of Suffolk different in New York City but we've increased funding dramatically exponentially and so it's not just a question of funding it's how you use that funding and I've worked on the homeless issue since I was in my 20s first I ran a not-for-profit I was the largest not-for-profit provider for homeless families in the United States then I'm with the federal government I worked on homeless programs all across the country I've been in more homeless shelters homeless programs than probably any other elected official so it's it's not just money it's you have to know what you're doing and you have to have a program that makes sense [Music] look the best we can do you still have to run elections the court said we have to run elections I don't think it's a good idea to have people go standing on line to vote you shouldn't say to a person if you want to exercise your civic duty you have to endanger your public health and possibly endanger others we've seen video of other elections held across the country we have people waiting on line six feet apart to vote I mean that that made no sense to me so to the extent we can do absentee ballots and make that available to everyone and mail them out to everyone and make that easy I think that is the best way if we have to also have an election day with people show up on Election Day my two cents to people is please vote by absentee ballot so you don't have to show up but then if they have to show up they have to socially distance etcetera are you doing anything to make sure that the boards of Elections around the state are able to handle what you are asking them to yeah well we're working with all the local boards of Elections I've not heard from any Board of Election that says they can't send out the ballots we told them last week they have to we'll send out pre-stamped forms that people can just send right back and I haven't heard any issues from any local boards of Elections have you heard we're working closely with the local County Board of Elections as well as the heads of the Democratic and Republican Party to make sure everyone has confidence and how the elections are being held there's a very real possibility that certain elections won't be called on election night that is a reality people should prepare for because as you said the hope is the majority of the people are going to be mailing in their absentee ballot and so we want to make sure that the counting process is done right and it's thorough and that people continue to have confidence and faith and democracy and so that may mean that certain elections are called a couple of days afterwards to make sure the counts are done properly in terms of helping to support the county boards of Elections one of the things we've discussed internally if it's something that they need is supplementing with the National Guard and seeing if the National Guard can step in and help where we know that they meant that there may be issues but it is something that we're focused on and continuing to talk to the county boards but on a consistent basis tell me what happens with the pandemic between now and November or not answer the question could you do you have any understanding of whether people can be reinfected the east coast of West Coast or even or even in our region and whether the antibody test is any indication of the person's okay you're not beyond my paygrade on information so I'm going to refer the question to dr. Zurcher but just for what I know and what I believe I said the originally we were told the virus came from China right and everything was stopped the virus from China and China travel ban CDC comes out last week and says oh no it didn't come from China it came it went from China to Europe and then from Europe to New York which is a dramatically different situation because we were sitting here in New York February March watching China and the federal government came in and they were all our airports screaming everybody from China nobody screamed people coming from Europe and now it turns out they were like two million people who came from Europe during that time and they landed at JFK they landed it in Newark Airport someone to Chicago that's where the flights go and then they just mixed into society and then you have New York which is one of the most dense communities in the country and the virus took off nobody said it was coming from Europe right we people visitors from Europe work walked right through the airport nobody said two New Yorkers be careful if you just with somebody who came from Italy be careful they may have the virus nobody said that so it was totally new I can't speak to the East Coast strain versus the West Coast strain on the antibodies that was an initial thought that if you had gotten the virus and you had the antibodies that you would be immune to another infection I think that's now being questioned but again you're beyond my paygrade Thank You governor so what the CDC is doing and and others are looking at is the genetic fingerprinting of this virus to try to figure out the differences between whether it's those came from China and from Italy and unfortunately all the information is not out yet about how this has whether it's mutated what's the difference of these viruses and the severity of the virus as to whether a one strain would be worse than another regarding the antibody issue as the government said initially the feeling was that one has an Tobias a should be protected but we continue to learn more about this virus every day and that's one of the things we're going to learn more about is the protection from when you have antibodies and what that means and also for how long that protection would last if one is protected from that so it is a great question it's hard to give you an answer at this point right now because there's still more research to do today someone from Illinois did they think the virus may have come last December or November so they're looking at autopsy reports to see if it should have been a cause of death last year which to me is just a wake-up call that you know we think we know what we know but nobody knows nobody knows I mean look at all the revisions that are now going on about all the facts that we thought we knew January February March all the necessary criteria even landing behind the city on one key data point why is that and along with that the contact tracing seems to be a big challenge and yesterday and as you said that there's going to be this software for the contact tracing system isn't giving online for four weeks what role does that play in the one of the new systems that we have to develop here is everybody talks about test trace isolate we have to do thousands of tests by the way we've already done 1 million tests in this state this state is brought testing online faster than any state in the country and we now do more tests per capita than any country on the globe in New York so we've been very aggressive and successful at bringing testing online but we have to have testing in every region Long Island New York City upstate different regions upstate and then an army of tracers you're talking about thousands of tracers who take every positive call up every positive who did you go to dinner with who did you whatever and then isolate those people and you have that facilities to isolate people who can't be isolated some people can't be isolated at home so that has to be in place in every region we are working with regions to get that up and running but you have to have you have to have the virus on the decline and then you have to have a way to monitor that virus and that's testing and tracing I don't know about the counties software system I don't know Jim we spoke I spoke to the county executive last night and that is one issue that we're working with the county on is the testing and tracing the other piece that I think you refer to as the gross hospitalizations new people coming in the door which is a sort of concern of new infections the data that the governor mentioned today where are people coming from what are their demographic information who are they will help isolate and target better for people in regions to say here's a hotspot zone to get that infection rate down so this will help Long Island and other regions target better where the infections are coming from to lower that overall infection rate which will help in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the reopening process as we go forward and that's what Michael Bloomberg is helping us with putting together this tracing testing program again it's never been done before on this scale we have to do it now and then we actually want to keep it institutionalized because I don't believe this is the last time that we're going to go through this I think this is part of the overall new normal you know we're seeing storms we never saw before we've seen changes in the environment changes in weather patterns and I think this is going to be it's the first real public health emergency that we've had on this scale but I would not believe that this is the last time we go through it so I think learn the lessons and institutional distance not in this city because we're on Long Island here but in these let's call it in this city in this city when you're on Long Island this city is New York City although there are many cities in the state the social distancing is important the enforcement of social distancing and wearing a mask is left up to the local governments and the local governments have discretion and how to enforce it an obviously it should be enforced in a non-discriminatory non-selective way but I think it's important that it is important that people socially distance it's not I think I know it's important that people socially distance I know it's important that people wear a mask I know masks are now even believed to be more important by health care experts than they initially were that they can be more effective and it is so easy relatively in the scope of things to wear the mask I mean look we're at north well look at what the people here at north well just went through for the past two months to save lives and we're asking people wear a mask so you don't spread the infection compared to what people have gone through they don't want to wear a mask no that's not who we are it's not what we are we're part of a society we understand we're responsible one for another wear the mask I don't even have a good looking mask and I wear it I have this very plain boring white ugly mask but with this face it doesn't make a difference thank you very much guys [Music]""""]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Philippe is difficult enough but it's aggravated by the dearth of essential information those two articles from the same newspaper in that renowned left-wing crazy newspaper The Wall Street Journal if this extension of the public health emergency signals one thing it is this we can't give up one bit on the one thing that we know that is working in this fight social distancing so continue to stay at home unless it's necessary for you to go out and when you do go out please keep your distance from others and wear something to cover your face remember in the absence of either a vaccine or proven therapeutics for Kovan 19 specifically our only cure is social distancing covering our faces washing our hands with soap etc and we know by the way that the effort of millions of the state of you is working we have made enormous strides folks unlike any American state let's keep it that way today we're announcing an additional 1513 positive test results for a statewide total of 130 1890 however let's keep in mind that the big number we report is a cumulative total which has been growing since our first positive test was received back on March 4th of these more than two-thirds of these individuals more than 90,000 New Jerseyans have now exited the important two-week incubation window overwhelmingly they have defeated Cove in 19 as we look to the trend of new cases we continue to see the daily counts leveling even as more testing sites continue to come online and I'll touch on that in a few moments the rate of positivity among those who are tested continues to decrease as well as we've heard consistently now I think for the past couple of weeks from you Judy right the spread is slowing this is the map the map of New Jersey continues to show slowing rates of doubling of cases and this is a very good thing and stay on this if you could the two Orange counties Salem and Cumberland have each seen fatalities and they each have positive test results but the numbers are meaningfully lower by example as of today Salem has 353 positive tests Bergen County has 16,000 520 so it has come to that part of the state more slowly it's migrated as we've said so while the orange is darker in the bottom two counties on the left in Salem and Cumberland the fact of the matter is the numbers are a lot slower and God willing they'll get to the lighter shades sooner but look at that more than 30 days is that whole swath of counties that we now see that that's what it's taking to at least double and that's very good news so we continue to directly switching gears for a second we continue to directly and aggressively confront the challenges at our long-term care facilities as the number of positive cases and deaths connected to these facilities continues to grow and that is the number of fatalities from long-term care may I say this we've said it before we say consistently that our health care workers are literally heroic and I want to give a particular shout out to the health care workers and the workers generally who are going in and out of our long-term care facilities and have been doing this day in and day out and I've said in the past a couple of times as a special place in hell reserved for whatever there's a special place in heaven reserved in particular for those health care workers who were doing the Lord's work literally as commissioner Percy Kelly and Attorney General Gerber gray wall said yesterday we are taking aggressive measures within state government to protect the residents and staff at these facilities but we also know we won't have all the answers and in the midst of their efforts we will also need to look more broadly at this issue not just for the immediate days ahead which obviously is our priority but also for the months in the years to come to meet this challenge we are announcing today that we are bringing on a nationally experienced team of experts to take on three principal tasks first to provide immediate support to the great work of Judy and her team at the Department of Health specific to long-term care second to conduct a two to three week review to address immediate concerns related to protecting long-term care facility residents and staffs the folks I just referred to a minute ago as we look to restart our economy in third to make long-term systemic reform recommendations leading this team will be Cindy Mann on the left a 30-year expert in health policy and former deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama where she was also tasked by the way with implementing the Affordable Care Act and secondly Carol Raphael former chief executive officer and president of the visiting nurse service of New York as well as the former board chair of AARP we know the long term Kerr issue has been among the biggest challenges both here in New Jersey and nationally if not frankly the biggest and this will be an inclusive approach to solve this challenge that will make us a national model God willing switching gears as of 10:00 p.m. last evening 5221 patients with kovat 19 were being treated in our hospitals and as you can see this curve continues it's steady overall decline and as we see the number of hospitalizations across our healthcare systems regionally continues to also trend down that's North Central and South our field medical stations reported 36 patients last night while hospitalizations had a small increase the number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care checked up negligibly but it did tick up to 1549 but that is rough down roughly 25 percent jutti from just three weeks ago better later use currently stands at 1146 and this number - thank God continues to decline there were 439 new hospitalizations yesterday that's up meaningfully over the past couple of days but there were also 435 live patients discharged yesterday all of these numbers are pointing us in the right direction and while they are positive they still mean that thousands of our fellow New Jerseyans are still in the hospital battling Kovan 19 this is why I needed to extend the public health emergency we're seeing good signs without question but we cannot lull ourselves into thinking that all is well so let's keep focused on pushing these numbers down further that's means keeping up with social distancing wearing a face covering when in public and doing all the other seemingly little things that can make a huge difference in path this is especially for you I get criticized by a fuel though most loved the phrase the word knucklehead to describe the folks who are non-compliant and doing silly things check the governor from West Virginia he's got a little bit more of a graphic assessment those folks a few folks are worried about our being too graphic I think we look like a Disney movie in comparison we need to keep working with two things in mind public health public health creates economic health and data determines dates public health creates economic health data determines dates of course notwithstanding all of this progress we continue to lose precious members of our New Jersey family and even with this good news that we see from our health systems we cannot forget that there are families up and down this state who are receiving the worst possible news today we're reporting the loss of three hundred and eight more New Jerseyans to Cove in nineteen complications our statewide total now stands solemnly at eight thousand five hundred and forty nine bless each and every one of them let's remember a few of those we've lost right now first up Antoinette Tony Shadyac of Franklin in Somerset County born in Paterson to Italian immigrants she did not learn English until she started school and then she taught her parents to speak English it was a sign of things to come she graduated from what is now William Paterson University in 1960 it would make her career as an educator in Paterson teaching fourth and fifth grades as a math resource teacher and in computer education and if that weren't enough she also taught English as a second language night classes for adults Toni retired in 2005 at home she loved baking and arts and crafts and she was the one organizing the family get-togethers in 2009 Toni was diagnosed with vascular dementia and even though her can condition diminish greatly she could brighten up a room with her smile and you could see see that smile right in front of us she leaves behind her daughter's Annette and I had the honor of speaking with Annette yesterday and Michelle Toni was 81 years old her husband Thomas passed away shortly after their 50th wedding anniversary in 2013 and Tony passed the day before what would have been their 57th wedding

Leslie Billy's behind her father Michael calmus and his wife Barbara her sister Michelle and her brothers Robert and David and their families including her niece Kristen and her nephew David I had the honor of speaking to her brother Robert and his wife Nancy talking about reminiscing about Leslie and they wanted me to give a big shout out which I'm doing here with to Newton Medical Center which they said performed heroically unless Lee's behalf we send our condolences to them to the calamus family and our prayers at this time our flags are at half staff in their memory and in memory of all who have lost we have lost throughout this pandemic and they fly in half-staff and solidarity with those left behind we are a strong and diverse family and when we see these flags flying low let's remember that we all have a job to do so we could stop the spread and stop this overwhelming loss of life god bless each and every one of them let's switch gears for a minute I mentioned testing a moment ago and as we all know and expand in an accessible network of testing sites is one of the critical markers for us as we get back on the road to restart and recovery the number of available testing sites across the state continues to grow as of this morning there are 122 up and down the state different sites 31 which are either publicly run or open to the general public can be located at our information hub at kovin 19 NJ gov slash testing and a top of those 31 there are 91 more privately operated testing sites available and your private primary care practitioner can tell you where to find the one closest to you in the coming days we hope to be able to announce even more sites which will open soon make no mistake we are pushing as hard as we can to get the testing regime in place remember that's step 2 of the six step plan on our road to recovery step one is to flatten and break the back of these curves step two is a broad scale rapid return testing regime we are pleased with the work we are making through our partnerships with everyone from the federal government to Rutgers University with our private labs and everyone in between we are leaving no stone unturned and we are not leaving anything on the table we will get this marker in place next I'm proud also to announce that we have now exceeded pad it's hard to believe thirty five million pieces of personal protective equipment or PPE distributed by the Office of Emergency Management from our central warehouse a line of business that New Jersey was as a state was not in just over two months ago as with testing we have left no stone unturned in finding the masks gloves shields and other PPE our frontline Public Health and Safety responders have needed to keep safe throughout this emergency specifically I want to give some shoutouts to Pattie Panero at the office of emergency management who works under Pat and Wayne Jacobson at central purchasing who undertook much of the procurement of these items and to Chris Dempsey in the team at the Department of Treasury who vetted every vendor and another big shout out to New Jersey State Police Sergeant your colleague dan cunning who leads the logistics team tracking everything that enters and leaves the warehouse more importantly we're not going to stop we know that we have an immediate need we mentioned this the other day Judy and I were calling gowns the new ventilators right we have an immediate need for hospital gowns and we're doing all that we can to source these and through the multi state procurement Partnership that we announced on Sunday we are confident that we will not only be able to deliver the PPE and supplies we need but that we'll be able to do so at a lower cost to taxpayers getting PPE has in a race against time and in some cases it's also been erased against our neighboring states no more now we're working together to not just meet our collective needs for today but to ensure our entire region is better prepared for tomorrow finally this is something not related at koban 19:00 but frankly indirectly it is but it is of critical importance to our state and that is the census right now New Jersey is ranking 21st of all 50 states plus Washington DC and Puerto Rico in terms of our response rate to the 2020 census well that's better than some of our neighbors it's simply not good enough we're at only fifty eight point six percent we need to get this number up get it up meaningfully and get it up fast ensuring every New Jerseyan is properly and accurately counted in the 2020 census is incredibly important the census by the way is more than just a population count it is the data that the federal government and quite frankly we in state government rely upon to make decisions that impact every community in New Jersey we know that New Jersey was under counted in 2010 and because of that we have left over the course of the past decade and even today untold billions of dollars in federal aid on the table and if that money isn't coming to New Jersey it's going to some other state like Kentucky let's make sure we get the darn money here so if you have not taken the time yet to be counted please take a moment go online to 2020 census gov and make sure that you are counted so much rides on an accurate and full count before I hand things over to Judy I want to take a moment as I do every day to recognize some of the New Jerseyans who are really doing some good things during these unprecedented times you've shared a lot of their stories with us on social media by using the hashtag and Jay thanks you and I ask you to please keep it up as we get closer and closer to our restart these are the stories that remind us that our New Jersey spirit and our New Jersey values are our greatest assets first up here's a story that came to us via Twitter we have to give a huge shout out to the students of st. Joseph High School in Metuchen the students there decided to put together a fundraiser with the goal of nineteen thousand dollars to deliver PPE to frontline workers at nearby JFK Medical Center in Edison and they delivered in just two days they raised more than twenty thousand dollars and all of it will go to support JFK Medical Center's health care heroes so to all it's st. Joe's New Jersey thank you and go Falcons and let's close today with a face that may be a familiar face to many of you if you watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey as Pat does you know Jennifer Eden but you may not know that both Jennifer and her daughter Gabby have recently recovered from coronavirus and Jennifer has used her social media platforms which are considerable to urge her followers to do what they need to do to stop the spread now while Jennifer is waiting for the test results which could determine whether she could be an antibody donor she's been busy trying to source PPE for the frontline and nursing home staff at Bergin's Newbridge Medical Center and she has donated roughly three thousand n95 masks so to you Jennifer and to Gabby our best best wishes for your continued recovery number one and secondly New Jersey thanks you for keeping our frontline responders in your thoughts so I'll wrap it up there so to all of you to each and every one of you keep doing what you're doing we're making steady undeniable progress we can do this we will do this and we will emerge as one extraordinary New Jersey family stronger than ever before please help me welcome the woman who needs no introduction the Commissioner of the Department of Health Judy purser killing Thank You governor good afternoon well as the governor announced manat health will be working with us on a very tight time frame to complete a review of the state's long-term care facilities the review will look at what additional protocols resources and equipment should be put in place to best protect our residents they will compare New Jersey's oversight of these facilities to other states and examine differences in outcomes they will make recommendations on potential state or federal action to improve quality safety resilience and funding within New Jersey's long-term care system we look forward to working to building on these efforts with this team of experts who have more than 30 years experience and federal and state health policy these recommendations will guide how long-term care facilities can in the future safely care for their residents and the well-being of their staff they'll look at outbreak protocols they'll address mitigation protection and resiliency against future outbreaks the Department of Health will continue implementing protocols inspections and testing at all long-term care facilities while this review takes place so we are receiving lots of questions about the allocation of personal protective equipment or PPE specifically the supplies to our nursing homes here is what we did back in March the department worked with the New Jersey Hospital Association and the State Police to create a centralized inventory system that that was set up around March 24th at the New Jersey State Police Headquarters at the Regional Operations Intelligence Center the rock on March 28th the governor signed an executive order requiring all health care facilities to report daily their data concerning not only their capacity but also their supplies to the Office of Emergency Management the PPE distribution system was originally set up for hospitals but on April 6 based on reports we were getting long-term care facilities began reporting their PPE needs to the portal remember the supply chain contracted nationwide and there were hospitals with less than three to five-day supplies at the peak at the peak of Cove in nineteen so all forms of PPE were in short supply and the state aggressively stepped in to purchase PPE to bolster the supply chain so we recognize that even today there are still challenges particularly for smaller facilities like long term care and that's why the state continues to use its purchasing power as part of a joint multi-state agreement to develop a regional supply chain for personal protective equipment other than medical equipment and testing similarly testing resources had also been in short supply until last Thursday when governor Murphy and I met with the president at the White House we needed and we continue to need test kits reagents swabs and PPE especially gowns there are nine million residents in our state we won't need to test every single person but there is no doubt that we need to greatly increase our testing as a key to reopening the state this will be dependent on the resources that are available to us as I reported we've delivered about ten point seven million pieces of PPE to long-term care facilities additionally we inspected sixty facilities curtailed admissions at several homes sent Federal Veterans Administration to staff are our veterans homes we've issued over eighteen guidances now we are testing every single resident and staff statewide this focus on these facilities will continue with three hundred and fifty eight of the long-term care facilities reporting similar to hospitals five percent are reporting an urgent shortage of face shields four percent are reporting a shortage of gowns 2% a report reporting a shortage of gloves 2% and 95 and 1% surgical masks we will continue to work with them to source their needed PPE as the governor shared we're reporting 5221 hospitalizations of which 1549 are in critical care and 74% are on ventilators the governor reviewed the new case and death report to report it today's know in terms of deaths I will report the race and ethnicity white 52.6 black 19.3 hispanic 17.5 asian 5.3 and other 5.4 basically unchanged there are 512 long-term care facilities in the state with kovat 19 cases there are now 23 thousand 345 kovat 19 cases in long-term care facilities at the state veteran homes among a census of 676 residents there have been 361 residents that tested positive for kovat 19 and there have been a total of 125 deaths unchanged from yesterday and at our state psychiatric hospitals were the census of 1250 168 patients have tested positive and there have been 10 deaths again unchanged since last week according to lab data from this morning we've tested 256 thousand individuals 100 and 1000 tested positive for a positivity rate of 39.55 so that concludes my daily report stay connected stay safe stay healthy and I thank you Judy thank you when you go over the the race and ethnicity it reminded me I meant to say this yesterday your very close friend and New Jersey superstar rich Besser CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation wrote and by the way also a member of our restart and recovery commission as well as one of our rip senators on the Regional Council so he's wearing to say he's wearing multiple hats is an understatement he wrote an op-ed for USA Today which i think is a must read for everybody and it's called on coronavirus we know who will pay the price when states reopen before they should and it goes right at the inequities that you and I have been speaking about now for over a month and it paints a sad but accurate picture of the reality particularly across race in America and sadly we know we live with that in our state I was just responding to a couple of urgent I missed positivity rate for today 39 yeah so this continues to in the right direction and as you and Christina would want us to remind folks that's a cumulative number so the spot number is going to be inevitably better and it's also still disproportionately overwhelmingly disproportionately persons of with symptoms right that will change over time as I said yesterday we would hope sometime in the next number of days don't hold me to a day or don't hold us to a day but I know I think Judy will be in violent agreement with me here that we would hope to have both a testing protocol to very explicitly go through with you folks as well as on the heels of that at some point sooner than later or contact tracing the protocols as well I'll just go back to the all in effort on long-term care I think I could speak for Judy and myself we have no lesson objective this is not a New Jersey specific reality if you pick up a any newspaper about any state in America right now where this is hit it's crushing places we have no lesson objective not only to deal with the here and now as best we can but we want New Jersey to be a national model we want to be as good and get this as right as any state in America and that's the spirit with which we enter this so thank you for everything leadership report with that the guy who needs no introduction on any updates on compliance PPE infrastructure other matters please help us welcome Colonel Pat Callahan Thank You governor good afternoon generally quiet overnight with regards to compliance Newark Police issued 75 y/o violations in Perth Amboy two beauty supply store owners were cited for opening and having open a non-essential business in Teaneck a carwash owner was cited a violation for having his business open Point Pleasant individual was cited for allowing the gym that she operates to be open and in Point Pleasant a vape shop owner was cited for being open as a non-essential business real quick on gowns we've talked about gowns a lot I'm happy to report that we expect 400,000 gowns to be delivered to our warehouse this week so our fingers are crossed on that because as the governor and commissioner said they are in short supply and the burn rate on those gowns is phenomenal so we're glad to report four hundred thousand coming in and lastly also I'm happy to report that the commissioner and I will be meeting tomorrow morning up in East Orange with Lieutenant General Laura Richardson she's the commanding general of the US United States Army north she's a three-star general one of one of four three-star women in the United States Army and she's coming to meet with the commissioner and I to discuss the Department of Defense's current staff here and any future needs or any adjustments to the staffing so the Commissioner are looking forward and certainly appreciate Lieutenant General Richardson's time as as well as region two FEMA administrator Tom Venice and bonus and will be joining us as well thanks governor I was just saying to Judy the general has got an extraordinary reputation she is somebody who from all corners you hear just a great leader so good luck with that and very happy she's in New Jersey we're gonna start with Matt but before we do I believe at the moment we do not have a White House vtc scheduled for tomorrow Mahan will correct me if I'm wrong which means we will be gathering at about will be here at 1:00 o'clock tomorrow LSU here otherwise I would expect the same for Friday and Saturday as well so we'll stay on the same schedule we're not going anywhere this is still you know we're making a lot of progress but the fire still rages so you should assume we're going to stay plus or minus with the same schedule we've been on again I will hope to be able to get you over the coming days more information on testing strategy contact tracing at a minimum other updates will continue Thursdays our unemployment data days both nationally and in New Jersey I'm sure we'll be have something to say about that at least summarize where that stands and with that let's jump in afternoon governor saw real quick I understand that you said contact tracing an announcement will be forthcoming but just curious if the state has hired any contact tracers to date in just a couple of unemployment some people have received regular unemployment benefits who have received it excuse me who have received regular unemployment benefits have said they haven't received the $600 extended benefit they know they'll get at retroactive Lee but just some of these folks need it now and just curious that there's a reason why they aren't getting them we know you're working through the backlog but some people say they've been approved for benefits and they see the amounts that they're going to be paid but they've been waiting weeks or longer for their money any idea what the delay is in those cases and just lastly what are people supposed to do after they get approved for unemployment benefits and then it later goes back down to show that they aren't approved or that their balance is zero and it says it's not payable and they're not able to get anybody on the phone to clarify in those situations on contact tracing nothing to report but bear with us we're gonna have something for you over the next number of days we want to get this right so we want to make sure you know this these are that's the testing and contact tracing or steps two and three in our road to recovery I know I speak for Judy here we want to make sure that we get this as right as we can it'll be a combination of technology and boots on the ground who's doing the hiring and how many boots to be determined my head I don't want to get out over my skis but is it in my rights a we may have

"he Commissioner of late workforce development here tomorrow I don't have a good answer for you Matt on I know that the $600 is coming I'm not sure what the lag time is if you don't have it yet between what we're giving you versus the federal plus up I'm not sure I I don't have a good answer for you you're approved but you don't have it yet what's the lag time there and and I think your third question is what what if you at one point got registered and everything went well then you find out that you're not so if you could bear with me will either come to you offline or will have if you could have the patience till tomorrow we'll have Rob acero Angelo I think with us tomorrow thank you for that Paul good afternoon first are there in your view are there any limits at all neither the duration or the extent of your powers under emergency declarations second how can New Jerseyans accept having their economic freedom subject to the will of some of the out of state political operators on your recovery Commission such as Washington anti-trump activists near a tendon and why are they no representatives of small businesses on that panel and Shore businesses specifically and then Steve Sweeney suggested letting other businesses open up under the same social distance guidelines as Walmart Home Depot and other stores that plaque and welcome chief counsel any comment about the limits or duration of the executive power so there's two statutes that have been invoked there's the disaster Control Act which gives the authority to declare a state of emergency and then there's the public health emergency declared under the emergency health Powers Act the public health emergency by statute expires every 30 days unless it's renewed in order for it to be renewed the facts giving rise to the public health emergency have to continue to exist the governor today signed the second renewal of the public health ennio for the second time renewing the public health emergency the duration of a state of emergency is dependent on the facts as that caused or created the emergency and clearly the facts that created the emergency based on the presentation today continue to exist you obviously didn't see that ben bernanke was on there was george w bush's president representative running the federal reserve so we've got people from all spectrums both in New Jersey and around the country we've got at least three CEOs of big companies in New Jersey car in a former Charlie Lowry of Prudential Ken Frazier of Merck Denise Morris and formerly of Campbell's Soup so we're we want all perspectives Center for American Progress that'll really a lot of really good work on very data specific testing contact tracing not at all related to any of the politics that might enter into this from time to time we do have a small business representative her name is literally I'm embarrassed to say this slipping my mind I apologize and other businesses listen we're looking at that we're looking at that we've had I think I mentioned this yesterday I had a really responsible reach out to me from a mayor and and it was a private exchange so I don't want to give give give up identities here but it's a really well-thought-out plea on for Main Street small businesses and and again that's something we want to get to there's no question about that but you you look at the progress we're making that's because people are staying home they're not going out and that's the sort of still guiding principle here and we you know we've started to slowly take the baby steps Judy and her team and Christina they're gonna give us that tell us what the health reality could what market what the market can bear and we started with state and county parks and golf and that's gone well the weather's turned against us but it's gone well and and this that not a central retail is on the list that we're looking very carefully and closely at and and so that's you know stay tuned we just want to get this I started off deliberately reading from The Wall Street Journal a couple of articles that said there are an enormous amount of unknowns associated with this we do know that social distancing to your point your question is what probably the best weapon we've got I've said that time and time again Judy said a time and time again if we could do that responsibly you should assume that that's on the list of things we want to do thank you do you have something sir please I have to first for the colonel if you could give us an update on the numbers of sorry can you give us an update on numbers of law enforcement statewide who have tested positive for Cova 19 and the numbers of those quarantined and secondly for you governor what is the progress on universal testing for inmates and state prisons and correctional police officers thank you back to you that number I do have it as of this morning 495 law enforcement statewide tested kovat positive which was a decrease of just over four percent in the last day and currently 396 law enforcement officers are out quarantined thank you for that Jessica Gonzalez is the name that I was reaching for Paul on our Commission I apologized to Jessica if she's watching I've had the honor of being introduced by her so shame on me you should assume that what we would call Judy I think fair to say vulnerable populations including our Corrections populations are going to be high on the list when we go through the testing protocol it's already already happening right so the Department of Corrections has a full plan for universal testing they've already started but you're gonna you'll hear more on that as part of the testing protocols but again to give you a preview vulnerable populations our first priorities thank you for that sir you're good please three for you first could you tell us the number of or do you know the the number of children who have been tested and how many of those tests have come back positive Governor Cuomo has ordered excuse me he's ordering 3d printed nasal swabs to increase Coppa 19 testing capacity is this something that you and the state have considered I've Governor Cuomo ordered 3d printed nasal swabs to increase capacity is that something that the state is considered and then regarding migrant farm camps are there any updates on the safety guidelines and how the entire migrant community will be tested for covin and in the event of a outbreak in these foreign camps how will workers be quarantined and given medical service judi unless I'm looking at fatalities not a number of kids tested we have no fatalities under the age of 18 in this state I do not know the number we've tested do you all know the number of kids have been tested Christina yeah unfortunately I didn't bring it today either but we do remind people that if you are looking for the specific demographic descriptive stuff you can always go to our website we have a daily report cumulative of our cases we have the breakdown of the ages we have the breakdown of gender and so you know we ask you to refer to that or others we can get that later yeah mine you could follow up if you could with Christina I'm we're looking at everything on testing nasal swabs saliva the whole shootin match I don't have any specific on 3d printed ones but I'm sure that we if we do we'll have we'll have that as part of our testing news Judy's talked about the the the seasonal agricultural workforce as a is a big focus I mentioned that singapura thought they had this whole thing beaten to zero and they've had a flare-up because of this very same reality that we have in terms of the warmer weather where we've got folks coming in to help our farms up and down the state especially in the south and that's a it's going to be another one of those communities that we're gonna have a particular attention to do you want to add anything as specific to that journey sure we have a task force with or I should say a committee with agriculture and labor that has been meeting regularly and we have a full plan for seasonal workers we know that there have been several that have tested positive down south and that Salem Hospital is helping with that and the FQHCs from the south are ready to set up tents up camps and we're working with the growers the farmers I'll be on a call with them at beginning of next week to set up the whole system for testing again look for that to be a part of our discussion in the number of days ahead on testing let's go to a lease good afternoon Elise good afternoon on nursing homes what's the progress on the re-examination of causes of death do you know about how many fatalities now have been classified as coronavirus related upon that reexamination thank you thank you for that Judy or Christina again this is a work in progress you know we know we get the number the questions on deaths particularly in long-term term care facilities very routinely and you know we have various ways that we're looking at the different death numbers and you know we get information that it is reported to us from the long-term care facilities which is a little bit different than the actual numbers that we're looking at from our laboratory confirmation reconciled with our death certificates so you know again this is going to be something that we're continuously honing in on Elise is a non-medical certainly not an epidemiologist as Christina is this is a working this is this will be I think iterative and a work in progress I suspect not just in New Jersey there's going to be a constant review three steps forward one step back reality in terms of cause of death among other realities thank you Dave good afternoon hi governor could you guys give us a little more of an explanation of we're regarding this expert panel that's gonna look at the long-term care situation how long are they going to be working when do you think we might see some recommendations from them how is this going to play out how quickly do you think we could enact this stuff governor we've received some information that people in living in buildings either apartment buildings or condominiums they have elevators there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to whether you get in the elevator with somebody else especially if it's a small elevator whether you wear a mask or not some of these condo associations don't have any guidance about this what would your recommendations be how should people handle this and lastly here you've been talking for many many days but in particular recently about the importance of wearing a mask we know and we've seen all of us that we see knuckleheads yahoos wise guys slime dogs for whatever reason don't seem to be wearing a mask numbskulls numbskulls in that group as well something else in West Virginia I'm told but okay so could you remind everybody and perhaps the Commissioner who needs no introduction would also be good here why is this important to wear a mask I mean what are we accomplishing and what do we not accomplish if we don't wear a mask and would you governor recommend that people should say something to somebody like I saw he appeared to be a wise guy in a supermarket was not wearing a mask do I confront him do I ask him politely should I be afraid I know the colonel is armed he would not have a quite a problem making a comment but for those of us that are not what do we do I thought that last one you mean when I call the colonel and come in and help you may I say a couple of things and then I think it sounds like there's an ample opportunity both for you Judy and you Pat to weigh in here it's not an expert panel this is a this is a these are people who have a business that are going to come in hired by us as a state by Judy ourselves to actually do the three things that we talked about the near term and the in the long term steps and Judy can give more color than that so this is not unlike the Commission which we're going to for advice these are folks who are going to come and roll up their sleeves and help us I don't know that we've got elevator protocol I know that in our offices you have to wear and that's it our capacity limits is to per elevator I do we have a statewide elevator protocol Matt to the best of your knowledge we don't have a elevator specific protocol but we have various protocols for different types of buildings yeah what's what's what's give that some thought it's a very good point my pride to hang my hat on something I'd say to max must wear a face covering to Matt unless you're in a family group right well let's allow us to come back to that listen Judy and Christina could tell you why we wear face coverings and in the the health bona fides around it are unimpeachable so that's it's quite clear why we do it I'll let them say it I personally am of a strong opinion that there's sort of at least three very basic things we could do stay away from each other cover our face wash our hands with soap and water regularly I think if we all did that we would be and I think a lot of folks are doing that right now and have been doing it those are really basic but really smart things to do and again I'm by wearing this and that's why I don't want to get any closer to you um it's for your benefit not for mine right so I'm so I'm not spewing droplets on you within six feet and so we we take these off only to speak at these press conferences I don't want to get you in harm's way so first of all let me just say this that in a supermarket right now they have to be wearing the mask that has to be enforced by the operator and it's up to you but I would tell somebody that's not optional in an elevator FairPoint we don't have I don't think we've got guidance when I was in the Thompson Park in Monmouth County this weekend folks along the path for the most part we're not wearing masks I wish they were we were not mandating it we were recommending it I'm of the category that I think we should be stronger on that but there are also compliant there's then there's massive compliance challenges that make life for guys like pat even more almost unreasonably complicated any comments to either of the two folks to my right on masks in particular Christina as the governor mentioned yes the main importance of the mask is to protect others from you but you know it's a secondary note sometimes the mask is a nice reminder for us that don't touch your face I think because remember contamination your hands might be dirty if you accidentally touch your face you could potentially introduce virus into you know your mouth or your nose whether it's a corona virus or another respiratory virus so primary primary protection is for others but for yourself just a reminder don't touch your face judi anything you want to add on the on the folks we're bringing in there they're there and to help us work right oh yeah and they I was on the phone with Cindy man last evening and again this morning and they're gonna hit the ground running to look at not only what we're doing here in New Jersey they have national presence they've been working in a number of hotspots so we're gonna start comparing is there more that we should be doing and how do we implement certain protocols and what they would recommend so I look forward to any input that they can give us you know the residents of the long-term care facilities deserve it heroic workers who go there every day right again just to repeat three so three prongs one is immediate support on long-term care two is to do a very fast you know measured in two or three weeks review of where we are and then thirdly to give Judy and me and any any of us involved in this a recommendation sort of what this needs to look like is a long-term structural matter so thank you for that John you get to bring us out here today thanks it's the state collecting data from county jails on testing and deaths anything from essex on its antibody testing program and are you getting details about ice to take anything from essex essex Essex has an body testing program and are you getting any ice detained details about ice detainee testing governor you've been very vocal about other government agencies holding public meetings they shouldn't be the holding of virtually last night in Sussex County the Montague Board of Education held another in-person public meeting its second any comment on that any idea if the departed of Education signed off on that meeting and I have a couple questions about the task force you formed in January can you tell us what it's been doing since January anything specific it's that for example did it did they suggest any eoz you've signed can you tell us the people you've you've talked to the experts anything that's going on is it still meeting what's happening behind the scenes with that task force we've been trying to get some details on what it's doing and do you see it continuing for a while how is it integrating with these other commissions and task force reporting together let me start with the public meeting the people should not be meeting right now so mad am i right saying if you've got under ten what's the what's the the ten or under ten magic here I want to make sure I don't like my own executive order you your band on gatherings is still in effect there's the Colonel's issued an administrative order that says gatherings under ten are presumptively in compliance with with your executive order but we're not encouraging them I don't know how many people are in the room but if they're more than 10 neither Judy or I nor Pat would be happy god I should say that if facts indicated that the evidence indicates even under 10 if there's that the gathering shouldn't be happening that there's still discretion at the whole I don't have the do you have the county jail information Judy we tell can we come back to him that in that that includes I think you asked both about Essex and status of Essex County antibody tests county jails as well as ice detainees so can we come back to n on those mind will you help me with that the task force so I would just say this and Judy should come in behind me as it she's the chair of the task force the task force was we started discussing sort of what this looked like as a leadership team and certainly most importantly in the Department of Health this being coronavirus in January and I think it was Super Bowl Sunday that I put pen to paper to establish it under Judy's leadership and I'd say and again Judy will come in and correct and amplify the record here in the first number of weeks this was like a lot of task force's whole-of-government figuring out where we thought this was going to come at us what sort of a response we needed to have and buy some time I'm Judy I'm going to say late February early March certainly by March 4th we had our first case it's now all-out war so it's it's not it's a task force in the sense that it's the entirety almost it's every moment of every day of all of our lives so it's it's it's the reality of almost all of what we're doing in government right now as opposed to we're going to have a task force meeting at 2 o'clock on Tuesdays it's all-consuming it's it's clearly under Judy's leadership it's the war room at the at the rock it's the varieties jared maples it's Carol Johnson and Human Services it's the entirety our our team in the front office so I don't want to say it doesn't exist but but it's in fact it's morphed into every almost everything we're doing right now the task force has met weekly since February 3rd when the governor convened and the workers has generated from well how do we protect the people in each department meaning the people they care for people in group homes how do we keep up the WIC program how do we make sure that nutrition occur I mean that when I think it seems like we've been working on this for years and it's only been since February 3rd we're now meeting and sharing in fact I think we have a meeting today the algorithm for 10 and making sure that all of the group homes that were responsible for the populations that each and every department is responsible for whether it be transit or Children and Families Human Services that we identified vulnerable populations and make sure that the testing algorithm covers end to end from identification of the population all the way to isolation in quarantine for those that don't have a place to go so it's that's what we're working on now and it's it's been weekly journey and you mentioned interaction with the Commission just so our first Commission meeting Judy was on Monday on our side other than led obviously by dr. Shirley Tilghman and Ken Frazier on our side it was me Judy Tim Sullivan talking about the economic impact in Liz Moyo talking about the impact on our budget so they're all members and and that's that was the tangible example of the interaction I cut you off earlier I should have backed to Dave's question before we break here any other advice you're in a supermarket you see somebody not wearing a mask what do we do I think you nailed it go I think the the most prudent thing is to let the store management or operator know I don't you know we don't want to see physical and verbal altercations at supermarkets I think to the governor's point that's what I would do and if I can just add to John's question about the task force that the Commissioner chairs right out of the gate we lead the incident command structure over that which is the planning logistics operations as well as the fiscal / administrative support so we're guided by those four basically pillars of incident command and that's under as the governor said under commissioner Percy Kelley's oversight thanks cuff you so I'm gonna mask up here as we as we exit stage left again tomorrow we are here unless you hear otherwise at 1:00 p.m. and and Friday assume as well at 1:00 p.m. and Saturday at 1:00 p.m. again folks thank you for everything you're doing keep doing what you're doing again I have to repeat this it's making a huge difference and in particular a huge kudos for the state and County Park and golf protocols that you all observe because it was overwhelmingly really good and that's going to allow us to move the ball if we keep that up that allows us to move the ball down the field on things like what's the beach scene going to look like what's that non-essential retail reality going to be what's construction going to look like what's elective surgery look like etc those are all decisions that we have to chop through again you'll hear in the next number of days and I'm don't hold me to how many a very comprehensive discussion of testing going forward and I think on the heels of that at some point sooner than later a similar discussion as it relates to contact tracing thank you all I want to thank the Commissioner purser Kelly dr. tan Colonel Callahan director Maples counselor Plotkin the rest of you god bless you all stay safe see you tomorrow you""""]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We live where you live.http://www.youtube.com/nowthisnews@nowthisnews",NowThis News,qQQffhWdihs,"['I\'ve Always been a maker. First, of course, things like\ntreehouses zip lines and eventually it turned more\ninto rockets and explosives. I always have my projects but they weren\'t for useful. That really changed when I found this\nproblem. My name is Boyan Slat and this is how I changed the world. When I was 16 years old I was scuba diving in Greece and I saw more plastic bags than fish and I wondered, ""why can\'t we just clean this up?"" As a high school science project. I chose to enter this problem and by everyone told me it would be\nimpossible to clean up. I then enrolled at the University of Delft started studying aerospace engineering and at some point in time I\nhad to make the choice am I going to fully\nfocus on the university right now or on this clean up project. And I thought well it\'s a high risk\nproject but if you don\'t try there\'s zero\nchance for this to happen. When I made the decision to drop out my\nparents questioned me about it. I think I had some good arguments. I think I\'m thankful that they let me choose a more unconventional path. There was no money for this. I had 300 euros of pocket money saved up. I think all of that we just spent on\nthe registration of the foundation and then I tried to do fundraising. And back then I really didn\'t know what\nit was doing. I wrote an email to a few hundred\ncompanies asking for sponsorship. I think only one replied and that person said, ""Well this is a terrible idea and go back to school this is rubbish. It\'s never going to work."" So that wasn\'t a very successful fundraising\nattempt but then fortunately eventually we\ntried the crowdfunding which was massively successful and that then allowed us to get\nstarted. Nobody ever deployed a structure of\nthis scale on the ocean aimed at collecting\nplastic. So the tricky thing was that we had to find out how to do this along the way. My observation has been that bad ideas usually get more complicated over time\nwhile good ideas get simpler over time. The original idea was about the seabed\ndoesn\'t move while the water at the surface moves. We can use this differences\nspeak to them collect the plastic. However the forces on the system because they were fixed to the seabed were so vast that these anchor lines had to be extremely\ncomplicated. We had several hundred lines to the seabed in water 5 kilometers deep. The number of lines we used would be able to circumvent the globe. It just became more complicated the further we went solving that problem. The team wasn\'t positive about the chances of success. It was just really, um, really tough. It\'s not like software where you simply change a few lines of code. You\'re talking about big structures\nhundreds of thousands of euros apiece so if something goes wrong it\'s it\'s really rather annoying. I remember the moment that I was\nconvinced that we had to change. I believe it was actually two interns\nthat were doing a master thesis that first suggested to go to a drifting design. Those clean up systems gravitate towards those areas with the highest density of plastic. It was such a beautiful simple principle. Within five minutes I was sold and said, ""Let\'s pivot the design and let\'s go in this direction."" After five long years of research and development and expeditions and prototypes now finally this September we\'re\nlaunching the world\'s first ocean cleanup system. If we were to deploy a fleet of 60 of these kind of systems we expect to be able to clean up half this Great Pacific Garbage Patch every five years. Once those clean up systems are out\nthere we want them to be able to pay for\nthemselves. So we take the plastic out, bring to land, and we turn it back into high quality desirable products that people can buy and with that they will be able to fund the cleanup. To be able to put off a project like this. I think one of the most important\nthings is that you have to be really obsessive and passionate about what you do. You will have to commit for the next\nfive or 10 years this being basically the only thing\nyou\'re doing for that period of time. If you\'re not truly obsessed it\'s not going to happen.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KELLY CLOSE: The economic impact\nof diabetes is devastating. We spent almost $350 billion on diabetes in the\nUnited States last year. NARRATOR: Diabetes--\na chronic disease that\'s notoriously\ndifficult to control. It can maim and even kill. A generation ago, less than three percent\nof Americans had diabetes. Today, it\'s almost ten percent. It is now predicted that half of the U.S. population will have either diabetes\nor pre-diabetes by the year 2025. Half! NARRATOR:\nLiving with diabetes today is a story of new discoveries about our food environments\nand choices. As a seven-year-old coming\nfrom a Third-World country and getting free candy,\nI was, like, ""Yo, I\'m so down\nfor America right now. Like, this is tight."" NARRATOR: It builds\non exciting new progress in drugs and technologies that have made the disease\nmore manageable. This device\nis around the corner, and that\'s really\nwhat we\'re trying to do, is get much better therapy\nto people that requires much less\nof their participation and provides much better care. NARRATOR: And it reveals\nthe terrible struggles that so many with diabetes\nstill have, day in and day out. So, they was looking at me,\nlike, ""How are you even standing here\non your feet? You\'re supposed to be\nin a coma."" CLOSE: So when we think\nabout the impact to the system-- way too many\nemergency-room visits, way too many amputations-- why isn\'t there\na war on diabetes? ♪ ♪ (siren blaring) WOMAN: She got her flu shot\nalready. So, this guy, I was just told...\nno, then he\'s fine, okay. We\'re good. Okay, let\'s put Goodall\nin a room and I\'ll have my nurse\npractitioner start with him. Thank you.\nWOMAN: That\'s good. DEAN SCHILLINGER:\nI\'m Dean Schillinger. I\'m a primary care doctor at San Francisco\nGeneral Hospital. One minute, okay?\nWOMAN: Okay. SCHILLINGER: When I started out\nas a young doctor, about one in 20 of my patients\nhad type 2 diabetes. Now it\'s one in two. NARRATOR: Diabetes undercuts one\nof the most basic functions of our bodies-- our ability to break food down\ninto nutrients, including the sugar glucose\nthat provides energy. - Okay. NARRATOR: The hormone that\nmanages sugar levels is insulin. ♪ ♪ So, think of insulin\nas the medicine that you can\'t live without,\nright? Like a key that unlocks\nthe door to your cells and allows the glucose\nto enter your cells. That keeps the level of sugar\nin your blood in check and your cells nourished. NARRATOR:\nThis insulin-glucose cycle is disrupted in diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system\nattacks and destroys the part of the pancreas\nthat makes insulin. In type 2, the pancreas makes\ntoo little insulin, and the body resists\nthe insulin it has. CLOSE:\nIt\'s really obvious when your blood glucose\nis too low, why that\'s dangerous. You know, you can\'t breathe,\nyou can\'t survive. Um, you won\'t live very long if you have blood sugar\nthat\'s too low. Blood sugar that\'s too high\nis equally dangerous, if not more dangerous over time. Diabetes is truly\na silent disease. It could take up to 15 years for someone with diabetes\nto develop the first symptoms that are related\nto high blood-sugar levels. You don\'t have a water and soap,\nyou want to use an alcohol pad. NARRATOR: For many people, by\nthe time diabetes is diagnosed, the damage is done-- damage that can include\nblindness, heart disease, strokes, even amputations.\nNURSE: All right. There\'s not a lot of things\nmore disfiguring than, than losing a limb,\nparticularly a leg or a foot. We now have a limb-salvage unit at San Francisco\nGeneral Hospital to handle the volume\nof these amputation patients, something ten years ago\nwould have been unheard of. I\'ve probably seen maybe\na thousand amputations. As far as these things go, it\'s healed really well.\n- Yeah. - And it looks good. NARRATOR:\nDr. Schillinger\'s next patient is a man with type 2 diabetes\nwho may be facing amputation. - Monteil Lee?\n- Yeah, hey, how you doing? - Good to see you. How long have you been\nin the hospital this time? - I\'ve been here for a week.\n- A week, okay. - Since Monday, rather.\n- Uh-huh. SCHILLINGER:\nMonteil Lee is a 36-year-old man from the Fillmore District, used to be the sort of heart and soul\nof African-American culture in, in the Bay Area. And like many young men, really has had\nvery little to no contact with the health care system, doesn\'t go to doctors\nfor preventive care, or anything, for that matter. (music playing on speakers) Kept living his, his life\nas a young artist was doing, which is making music. (hip-hop music\nplaying on speakers) So, now I want to talk\nabout your diabetes. How old were you\nwhen they told you? - I was 28. But I was experiencing\nsome things with my body that I\'ve never experienced\nin life before. - Mm-hmm.\n- I\'m going to the bathroom over 30 times a day.\n- Mm-hmm. - And I\'m just, like,\n""Something\'s not right."" - You\'re peeing?\n- But... yes. But I\'m very energetic. I\'m an on-the-go type of person, and I\'m starting\nto feel sluggish all these different days. And I felt myself\nleaving my body. - I see. - One of my cousins\nrushed me to the hospital, and they checked my levels, and they was looking at me,\nlike, ""How are you even standing here\non your feet? You\'re supposed to be\nin a coma."" - Right. - I thought I was about to die. So, they told me\nthat I had diabetes. And, at that moment,\nmy life changed. - Mm-hmm. Can we look at your foot?\n- Yeah. - Will that be all right?\n- Mm-hmm. I got an infection\non the top of my toe. - Just out of nowhere?\n- Yeah. (winces): Ooh. - Yeah, I can see that. You got a, still have\na little shallow ulcer there. And then it started on this side here?\n-Yup. - And, but they said\nyou might lose the toe? - Mm-hmm. SCHILLINGER:\nPeople with diabetes, because they\'ve got\na lot of sugar on their skin, the fungus loves\nto hang out there-- it\'s moist, it\'s warm,\nit\'s sweet-- and they grow foot fungus,\nathlete\'s foot, but in a person with diabetes, it can be the portal\nto death, right? So, the athlete\'s foot begins\nto burrow in the skin and create cracks in the skin, and that\'s, like,\nthe perfect opportunity for more virulent bacteria,\ndangerous bacteria, to enter into the skin and begin to infiltrate\nthe entirety of the foot. Okay, I think\nyou got to start... I\'m not your doctor here, right,\nbut I\'m going to tell you, you don\'t want to put\nany weight on it. - Yeah, I\'m fighting it. - Who\'s your regular doctor? - I don\'t have one. Uh-huh. - Okay. So, what I was going to suggest is that I could take over\nas your doctor. - That would be great.\n- All right. - (chuckles) I appreciate it. - No, I want to hear that\nyou\'ve not been on your foot for three weeks is\nwhat I want to hear next time. - The best doctor\ndeserves the best patient. - Exactly.\n- That\'s how it goes. - And I was going to say that. - See, great minds\neven think alike, too. - So, so we got,\nthat\'s the clinic, like, your primary care doctor. I will become\nyour primary care doctor. - Okay.\n- Okay, my friend. - Appreciate you.\n- You, too, good luck. - Thanks a lot. ♪ ♪ SCHILLINGER:\nI talked to the surgeon, and we both felt it was kind of\nlike a 50/50 proposition as to whether he was\ngoing to lose his toe or not. It would really be dependent\non his behavior, his choices. Would he stay off the foot, like, completely off the foot? Would he elevate the foot\nhigher than his heart? Would he take the antibiotics\ncorrectly and to completion? Would he manage his diabetes? Because that\'s perfect\nfor the bugs to keep growing-- they love the sugar. So, it was a lot of ifs. So, um... You know, this is a fairly\ntypical amputation story. I mean, it\'s... I could tell it again and again. The only thing that differs is the person with the foot. And in this case,\nhe\'s a very unique individual, as many people are, but he\'s, I think he\'s, he\'s very special. WOMAN:\nAll right, here we go. SCHILLINGER: If he can find\nthat story in himself... LEE: This is so awesome,\nI haven\'t smelled air in a week. SCHILLINGER: ...I do believe\nthat this experience, as, as terrible as it is, actually may be\ntransformative for him. It could go south, too. (people talking in background) DAN HURLEY:\n150 years ago, a doctor could go\nmost of their career and maybe see one or two people\nwith diabetes. It was just considered\na very rare disease, and it had been\nsince ancient times. NARRATOR: Records of diabetes\nmay go back to the pharaohs. This papyrus describes\ntreating the disease with seeds, honey,\nand yellow ochre clay. There were no better treatments\nuntil 1921, when insulin was discovered. But insulin was still\na treatment, not a cure. Even with new,\nmore effective drug formulas, in the last two decades, rates of both type 1 and type 2\nhave skyrocketed. Everybody knows that type 2\ndiabetes has been increasing. What people don\'t get\nis that type 1-- it used to be called\nchildhood-onset diabetes-- has been increasing\nat the same rate. When I developed\ntype 1 diabetes in 1975, I didn\'t meet anyone else who had that disease\nat my college. I didn\'t meet friends, I didn\'t have family\nwho had type 1 diabetes. Today, I know so many people\nwith type 1 not because I wrote\na book about it, but my neighbor down the block, the, the girl around the corner, the editor of my local paper,\nthe priest at my church. NICOLE: My name\'s Nicole,\nand I\'m a type 1 diabetic. People always say,\n""You\'re type 1. Is that the kind that\'s worse?"" Well, I have diabetes\ncomplications, and from where I\'m sitting, it doesn\'t matter\nif you\'re type 1 or type 2, both type 1 diabetics\nand type 2 diabetics can get complications. And they\'re\nthe same complications. NARRATOR: The complications\nin diabetes tend to accumulate slowly, as the extra blood sugar\ndamages the eyes, the heart, other organs bit by bit. NICOLE: So, basically,\nmy blood sugar is in the 90s and is trending down,\nso that\'s what I\'m watching. NARRATOR:\nFor type 1s, the complications can also be\nimmediate and disastrous. The pancreas is\nno longer making insulin. Sugar is not getting out of\nthe blood and into the cells. Your body is designed to have\nblood sugar at a perfect level. It\'s really incredible how well the healthy body\nregulates the blood-sugar level-- not too high, not too low. I think that no one prepares you\nfor, mentally, what it\'s going to take to live\nwith something that\'s so 24/7. - Wonderful. NICOLE: I\'ve had diabetes\nfor 18 years, and you always have to be\nthinking. You have to think before you exercise--\n""What\'s your blood sugar?"" Before you go to sleep,\n""What\'s your blood sugar?"" In the middle of the night,\n""What\'s your blood sugar?"" When you\'re sick,\n""What\'s your blood sugar? You know,\nit, it never escapes you. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR:\nNicole\'s diagnosis started with the classic symptoms\nof diabetes, so well known\nthat a 17th-century physician called the disease\n""the pissing evil."" I had to pee all the time,\nand I was drinking a lot. And I remember telling\none of my friends, I said, I was, like, ""There\'s\nsomething wrong with me."" I was drinking,\nit\'s like you\'re in a desert, and you are... You\'re so thirsty, like,\nyou can\'t stop. From there,\nI was telling my mom. She was, like,\n""I think we need to get you tested for diabetes."" And I was, like,\n""Diabetes, what\'s that?"" I didn\'t know what it was. And she\'s just, like, ""We need to take you\nto the doctor."" And she took me, and right away,\nthey diagnosed me with diabetes, and they started me on insulin\nwithin days. I actually, I didn\'t end up\nin a coma. A lot of people will end up\nin a diabetic coma and have to be hospitalized. I think my blood sugar was,\nlike, maybe 375-ish, somewhere around there. So it wasn\'t you know, 800-plus. So, I got lucky, so, yeah. When you get diagnosed at 17,\nit\'s hard. I was so afraid to go low\nthat I kept myself high. Because low blood sugars to me\nmeant I could die, and specifically,\nI could die in the night, like, when I\'m sleeping. I am unconscious every night\nwhen I go to sleep, and I can\'t know\nwhat my blood-sugar level is. One time, I was alone\nwith our daughter, who was then\nabout eight years old, and she found me\nsweating profusely and unable to come to. And she realized something\nwas very, very wrong with me. She didn\'t know\nwhat she was supposed to do. She wasn\'t quite sure. She knew I needed\nsomething ""sweet."" So, she went into the kitchen\nand got marshmallow fluff and began spooning it\ninto my mouth. And she saved my life. NICOLE: Someone\nthat doesn\'t have diabetes, their blood sugars are stable. They\'re consistent, just\nkind of like a line like this. But, with me, my blood sugar\ncould be up, down. So, when it\'s up, it\'s high,\nand when it\'s down, it\'s low, and so the low blood sugars\ncan make me potentially go into a diabetic coma. And I was terrified.

We really had two tools\nat our disposal: We had insulin\nand we had glucose. Sugar, basically--\ncarbohydrates, which is in foods\nlike fruit, juices... Foods that would raise\nblood sugar, carbohydrates, we would use to keep his blood\nsugar from going too low. And then insulin was delivered\nto bring his blood sugar down. So these things are working\nto oppose one another. And the reason\nyou need the carbohydrates is because you can very often\noverdose insulin just a little bit. But even a small amount\nof insulin can be lethal. We were injecting him\nwith insulin with a needle probably seven times a day, and we were checking\nhis blood sugar 15 times a day. That\'s how we started. When we checked his blood sugar, we used his fingers\nand his toes, so if he was playing with blocks\nin the middle of the room, I\'d come up,\nand I\'d poke him in a toe. He had bruises up\nand down his arms for those first two months when\nwe were giving him injections. And that was something that\nreally was hard for us to see.

Basically, what would happen\nis, people would waste away. They\'d lose\nall of their muscle mass, and ultimately,\nthey would just die. And so insulin in itself\nis not a cure, but it\'s an extremely\nvaluable medicine. HURLEY: It wasn\'t until\nthe early 20th century when insulin was\nfinally discovered. So, Fred Banting hooks up\nwith Charles Best at the University of Toronto, and they started\nanimal experiments. They finally figured out\nhow to take a pancreas from a cow\nand extract the insulin. VIKAS SAINI:\nAt that time, it was crystal-clear that this was a huge discovery that would save\nmillions of lives. And it was crystal-clear that you could charge\nwhatever the market would bear. And Banting and Best\nwere very concerned that people not be gouged. So, they went to the University\nof Toronto, they arranged for the patent, and then the patent was sold\nto Eli Lilly for one dollar. And what they said was," """"We don\'t want this to be\na moneymaker for us. """"We want to make sure\nthat insulin is affordable for everybody who needs it."""" Now", that was in the 1920s. NARRATOR:\nA half-century later, insulin costs were still\nquite moderate. A type 1 diabetic might spend\naround $200 a year on the drug. Then the price of insulin\nbegan to rise, rapidly. ANCHOR:\nMore than 29 million Americans live with diabetes every day, and for some\nsix million of them, insulin is\na life-or-death medication. Between 2002 and 2013, the price more than tripled\nto more than $700 per patient. In the last 20 years, the price\nof insulin has gone up tenfold. It is among\nthe most expensive medicines that are required\nto keep people alive. If you don\'t have\nhealth insurance, you cannot afford insulin\nin this country right now. It\'s just prohibitively\nexpensive. NARRATOR:\nWithout insurance, some patients report\nspending $1,000 or more a month\non insulin. For people\nwho can\'t afford that, the consequences may be deadly. WOMAN:\nKid\'s tee-ball team. BRITTANY SMITH:\nAlec had this smirk that just kind of lit up a room.

NICOLE SMITH-HOLT:\nHe turned 26, so he was no longer eligible to be under\nmy, my insurance policy. We went to the pharmacy\nthe first time to pick up his insulin.

He didn\'t tell any of us\nthat he was doing this. I think he was enjoying his, his freedom of living\non his own for the first time, so, I, I think that\'s\nwhy he didn\'t ask for help.

SAINI:\nImagine yourself being a citizen in a town in the desert\nwhere there\'s no water for hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds of miles, and the only way\nyou can get water is by going out and purchasing it. And imagine if there were\na handful of companies in that town\nthat were selling water, and they had\na monopoly on water. Well, the entire community\nof people with diabetes is in that boat. In 1996, insulin cost $21. 20 years later,\nit cost $255. You have to ask yourself," """"Why has the price\nbeen going up?"""" So", what you get is pricing that reflects the power of the\npeople selling the product and the lack of power\nof the people who absolutely need the product. The pharmaceutical companies, the big three\nthat manufacture insulin-- that\'s Eli Lilly,\nNovo Nordisk, and Sanofi-- if you look\nat the reported revenues from these companies\non their insulin products, now globally, they\'re up\nin the tens of billions. But you still hear\nstory after story of patients who are rationing.\n- Yeah. - Patients who are harmed because they can\'t afford\ntheir insulin. How do you make sure\nevery patient can get the medicine they need? - Yeah, well, we\'re, you know,\ndeeply bothered by that. The facts you lay out are true. The list prices have gone up. Our net pricing is\nbasically flat since 2009. Where\'s all that money\ngoing in the middle? It\'s going to negotiators\nin the middle, but not to patients," who are increasingly\nsubjected to the list price. And they have to make choices\nlike that that they shouldn\'t\nhave to make. NARRATOR:\n""""Negotiators in the middle"""" refers\nto pharmacy benefits managers", a key part\nof the drug pricing system. As the insulin manufacturers\nexplained to Congress, they set the list prices\nfor insulin. But then pharmacy benefits\nmanagers negotiate rebates that are supposed\nto lower consumer costs. Despite the investment\nthat we make in rebates, some patients, including those\nwith insurance, end up paying list price\nor close to it at the pharmacy counter. As a manufacturer,\nNovo Nordisk has no control over what insurance... what insured patients pay\nat the pharmacy counter. So despite this ever-increasing\nrebates that we pay, patients don\'t get the full\nbenefits of those rebates at the pharmacy counter. This needs to change. Patients are rightfully angry\nabout rising out-of-pocket costs for many medicines, and\nwe all have a responsibility to address a system that is\nclearly failing too many people. NARRATOR: All three of the\nmanufacturers blamed the system, not their list pricing. SAINI:\nSo everybody\'s pointing fingers, and in that environment, it\'s easy to point a finger\nat the PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers, because they got plenty\nto answer for. But the same is true of\nthe pharmaceutical agencies. Eli Lilly tonight is planning\non selling a cheaper version of its top-selling insulin,\nHumalog. The drug maker hopes this will\nease the financial strain for patients. But an advocacy group says\nmuch bigger changes are needed. NARRATOR: The manufacturers,\nunder public pressure, have supported programs\nto cap insulin costs. But they\'re not\navailable to everyone. And people without insurance,\nlike Alec, may still pay full list price. SAINI:\nPharmaceutical companies. It\'s their product,\nit\'s their price, and it\'s their customers\nthat are dying \'cause they can\'t afford\ntheir product. That makes no sense. And I think it\'s\na matter of responsibility. Own up to what\'s going on. People who have no insurance, all sorts of people\nfall through the cracks.

I think he\'s done a great job of basically trying to avoid\nsugar-sweetened beverages, which is the big thing\nthat got him in this problem to begin with. To a large extent, you know, the health system hasn\'t\nmade it easy for him. First of all, he\'s been having\nproblems getting Medicaid. The forms are very hard\nfor him to complete. Then, it\'s quite challenging to\ntake the kind of insulin regimen that he takes now, which\nrequires four injections a day. To the best that I can tell,\nhe\'s been doing that. And so he\'s trying to tackle\nboth his personal choices and, simultaneously,\nimprove the environment in which he has found himself in\nsince childhood. TV ANNOUNCER: Tonight, on NBC... NARRATOR: Many people\nwith diabetes struggle with the same complex problems\nas Monteil. But they can also manage blood\nsugar with remarkable new tools that no one even imagined\na few years ago. Technology is getting us\nwhere biology hasn\'t gone yet. Be prepared. HURLEY: When I developed\ntype 1 diabetes in 1975, there was no such thing\nas doing a finger-prick test to find out\nwhat your blood sugar was. It was a big deal when, in the early \'80s,\nthis became available. People could get a little drop\nof blood, put it on a little strip, and voilà, there is\nyour sugar level. This was a huge breakthrough. Then the insulin pumps,\nsoon after. People say," """"Well"," why\ndo you need an insulin pump? Can\'t you just take injections?"""" Yes", but the pump\nallows you to release, like your body does,\na little bit every few minutes. And it gives you just\nwhat you need as you need it. NICOLE:\nSo, I have the pod, and then it also comes\nwith a needle. NICOLE: I\'ve been on an insulin\npump for 16 years. You turn it around, and I am going to fill it\nwith insulin. So this is what\nthe insulin comes out of. A needle does go into my skin,\nbut then it retracts, and all that\'s left\nis this little tube. (device clicks) And that\'s it. NARRATOR: The next big step\nin technology was the continuous\nglucose monitor, which measures blood sugar\nevery five minutes and transmits the information. As it was on my body,\nflush with my body, I would press this button,\nand it would go," """"Bink."""" And then I would go like that", and then it would be on me. And I can take my phone and check\nwhat my blood sugar level is. Let\'s see. Let\'s take a look. Ah, it\'s 101. It\'s perfect. But this would have been\na crazy fantasy even ten years ago. There was no such thing. My continuous glucose monitor is by far my favorite way\nto manage my diabetes, and it\'s what makes me\nfeel the safest. And then my mom is also on\nwhat they call the share app, and so she is able\nto get my blood sugars, too. So, if I went dangerously...\ndangerously low, and I passed out in the kitchen, and she got an alert,\nshe could send paramedics. These things keep me alive. The next step for diabetes is, is connecting this monitor\nwith my pump, so that the two talk\nto each other, and it controls my pump and\ndecides how much insulin I need without me having to think\nabout it all day. And that would be, essentially,\nan artificial pancreas. NARRATOR: It\'s what Ed Damiano\nand other scientists have been working towards\nfor decades. ♪ ♪ ED: The bionic pancreas\nreally builds on the shoulders of, really, decades\nof technology development in medical devices. It comes from the synthesis\nof continuous glucose monitors, from insulin pumps,\nfrom smartphones, and it\'s the integration\nof those three technologies that makes a system\nwhich is really better than the sum of its parts. It\'s basically got automated\ndecision-making software that determines how much drug\nto deliver to the person with type 1\ndiabetes every five minutes. It makes 288 decisions every day\nthat you no longer have to make. (applause) So, David is a teenage boy. Now, I was a teenage boy, so I, you know,\nI know whereof I speak. And teenage boys are not human. (laughter) Teenage boys are highly complex\nmulticellular organisms at best. They\'re a disconnected mass\nof excitable cells, but they\'re a danger\nto themselves, as I was many times over, again. David once nearly stabbed\nhimself with a toothbrush. Imagine that for just a moment. All of the worries and the fear\nof type 1 diabetes, and we almost lost him to stabbing, self-stabbing,\nby a toothbrush. I feel like as long as he\'s\nwith us, he\'ll be safe, but the worry is,\nwhen he leaves home, when he\'s on his own,\nwhen he\'s in college, and he\'s got to, he\'s got to check\nthose blood sugars at night. Will he wake up at night? Will he wake up\nto see another day? I... we, we cannot, we must not\nget that phone call. The bionic pancreas is\na sturdy bridge to a cure. It is... HURLEY: I\'m glad to see Ed\nwith other people all in a race to bring the artificial pancreas\nto the market, because the more players,"\nthe better the odds that someone will come up\nwith the right system. """"The race for the best\nclosed-loop system""""-- are you kidding", the best? I mean, the best is\ngoing to depend on, what do you need,\nor what do you need, or what do I need, right?

ED: So, what are you studying?\n- Computer science. - Very good, excellent. How long have you had type 1? - About a year.\n- A year? Oh, my goodness.\n- Yeah. ED: We have a handful\nof subjects that are, you know, young adults,\n18 to 22 years of age. Some of them are in college. I\'m hopeful, if everything\nworks as we expect, the bionic pancreas\nwill allow them to think about their diabetes much less and get nevertheless\nmuch better control.

in America these days you might want to leave now because what Chris Hedges provides in his searing new book America the farewell tour is a pretty bleak account of the mess that we're in just in the first few pages Chris notes that civilizations over the past six thousand years have the habit of eventually squandering their futures through acts of colossal stupidity and hubris then he adds we are not an exception we are entering this final phase of civilization Chris and experienced journalists goes on to detail the evidence of decline and and growing despair in the opioid crisis increases in gambling the prevalence of pornography the spread of magical thinking the resurgence of hate groups the explosion of xenophobia and so on he examines these developments sees the rise of Donald Trump and his authoritarian populism as an outgrowth a natural exploitation of these trends and issues a passionate call to action to reverse this disintegration while there's still time anyone familiar with Chris's extensive writing over the years won't be surprised by the sharpness and forcefulness of his critique the detail and broad scope of his reporting and the many scholarly references woven into the book for the first two decades or so of Chris's professional life he reported overseas as a correspondent covering conflicts in Central America the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia much of that period he spent with the New York Times and he was part of the team of times reporters who in 2002 when the Pulitzer for explanatory reporting for their stories before and after the 9/11 attacks profiling the global terrorism Network and the threats had posed for the past decade chris has been a columnist for the Kress of news and commentary website TruthDig and he hosts the show on contact on Rt America a graduate of Harvard Divinity School Chris was ordained a minister in the Presbyterian Church four years ago he's also taught at Princeton and several other universities and conducts college credit courses in the New Jersey prison system plus he's written about a dozen previous books over the past decade and a half including his first war is a force that gives us meaning which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and six years ago days of destruction days of revolt with cartoonist Joe Sacco which was a best-seller Chris has spoken here several times before and I'm sure we're in for a very spirited and provocative discussion so please join me in welcoming and back thank you so I'm gonna speak for about a half hour and then we'll open it to questions for half hour that's the every book that I've written has a kind of template and for instance days of destruction days of revolt which I did with the great cartoonist Joe Sacco one of the finest journalists in America and if you have not read footnotes in Gaza which he spent six years on it's a masterpiece on the israel-palestine conflict I knew it was it was gonna be a rough one to go through and I got up actually got up Easter morning before everyone in my house was awake so that it would be still and quiet and that book just reduced me to tears that book was really modeled on let us now praise famous men the great work by James Agee and what are the photographs by Walker Evans this book my kind of model was Emile Durkheim's great study of suicide at the end of the 19th century in France where Dirk who was an amazing sociologist very much like w eb des bois where he would go out he didn't he didn't remain trapped in his particular academic Enclave but really went out and listened and interviewed that which is of course what made Dubois such remarkable and important presence and sociologists within the United States writing about african-american african-american communities and he came to the conclusion this is where we get the term anomie that societies that disintegrate that's societies and decay communities in decay create diseases of despair that's not his term that's his idea pathologies that are expressed that that that that that rise up from failed states and those would be self-loathing a sense of a lack of self-worth alienation all as Durkheim says that comes when you no longer have faith or belief in the established order the established ideology and established institutions and and and that that those kinds of pathologies are expressed in very self-destructive activities gambling hate crimes sexual sadism which is what pornography is and although I went to the extreme and my book Empire of illusion I had written about the porn industry but for this book I went to kink.com hopefully none of you know what it is I didn't know what it is derekjjensen had to tell me what it was they bought the old National Guard Armory in San Francisco and run the largest BDSM operation in the world which is live-streamed look Torre it is tortured as clearly I mean women are waterboarded and stuff and then people will be people can stream in and say what they want done to the women I mean just appalling but anyway I went to these classes for like which were held in the basement of the armory for Dahms dominate dahm dahm what do they call them people who are dominant people who like what do they call no they're not dominatrix their their their their dweeby guys who dress in black and me sitting in the basement I was not dressed in black and I actually wrote the gambling chapter out of the Trump Taj Mahal before I even knew Trump was even go to announce which was inappropriate decay I mean there was mice all over the place the lights were burned out and people were shooting up in the elevators and most of the Taj Mahal was mothballed it gets a nice picture of what's gonna happen to the rest of the country if he remains in power and then I was with these white hate groups nights the alt-right proud boys which of course hate groups or product of a diseased society the 3% ORS I was actually at one point at night around a bonfire with these guys in upstate New York and I of course living in mortal fear that someone there would Google me and at a bathhouse with my research assistant who was terrified quite justifiably so and at one point across the bonfire in the dusk we saw two or three of these guys pointing at me that's when like we we got out like as fast as we actually when we got to the car she was so frightened she she'd like crawl down to the floor and and their counterpart on the left and I've been very critical as some of you may know of the black bloc and antifa for much the same reason I was in these de-industrialized pockets Anderson Indiana and one of the things I liked about as a writer I lie in joy reporting I I I like it because it when I go out it often shatters my own assumptions about what is happening and it keeps me intellectually honest so sometimes you know I can go into a subject and think that I have a great body of knowledge I wrote a book on the Christian Right which has become unfortunately I think fairly relevant to our particular political situation it's called American fascists the Christian Right and the war on America I was trying to reach out to them and but I come out of the liberal church my father was a Presbyterian minister of course as you heard I'm a graduate of Harvard Divinity School but I didn't really know much about the Christian right and I went in there with all sorts of assumptions and and and I would say even stereotypes about the kinds of people who embrace this form of fundamentalism which i think is is heretical it's Christian heresy but I couldn't listen to these stories of dislocation and pain sexual domestic abuse struggles with addictions evictions bankruptcies without having it break my heart and it rewrote I rewrote the whole book the first chapter is called despair and it drove home to me what despair does and at the great study of the raw one of the great studies of the rise of fascism by fred stern is called the politics of cultural despair hannah errant in the origins of totalitarianism holds up despair again i think going back to Durkheim that sense of worthlessness that sense and it propels people into a kind of magical thinking I also in the book was with Preppers and survivalists in Utah who have a little food in their bunker and a lot of ammunition but I think that magical thinking what anthropologists call it crisis cults is a natural response to people who are just so overwhelmed by reality that they can't cope and when I was in Anderson so Anderson Indiana used to have most of the big GM plants and then Clinton gave the gift of NAFTA to the American working class and GM hightailed it down to Monterrey Mexico where they pay workers without any benefits or job security $3 an hour so your union salary of 25 and if you were a senior level over time you know you could be making $50 an hour you had benefits you had a pension plan you you were medically covered you had you were in the UAW at job secured Saul vanished and Anderson went into the kind of tailspin that many de-industrialized pockets of the United States went into with all of the attendant problems including of course the rise of a casino like this whole idea of economic development through gambling I watched that work try to work in Yugoslavia and it doesn't come to a good end the idea that you're going to fill state revenue shortfalls with gambling I mean so what was fascinating about Anderson is that most of these old UAW workers voted for Bernie Sanders but when the general election came around they voted for Trump because they weren't going to vote for Clinton after NAFTA they were acutely aware and perhaps their anger was even greater at the Democratic Party than the Republican Party because it was the Democratic Party that had betrayed them that had pretended to fight for their interests and their concerns that continued to use the feel your pain language of traditional liberalism but had thrust a knife in their back and that betrayal is very dangerous it as it is you know two Baldwin's when James Baldwin writes about I'm and one of his essays he writes about why he thinks african-american middle-aged men don't have a midlife crisis the way white middle-aged men do he said because african-american men are not prone to believe in the American Dream given the the forms of oppression that mutating our protein and exists throughout our how to exist and and having always existed throughout American history and I think that there's a certain wisdom in that that that these of course the highest and I write about suicide the highest percentage of people who commit suicide in this country which is an epidemic are middle-aged white men people who realized that in fact the society has there is no place for them they they that the American the quote-unquote American dream was a lie and so what's happened and and it's been a process over a few decades is that we have undergone what John Ralston saw calls a coup d'etat in slowmotion a corporate coup d'etat and slow-motion Sheldon Wolin if you don't know Sheldon Wolin please read him we just lost him a couple years ago I did a 3-hour interview with him right before he died on YouTube which was very humbling I had reread all his books I had pages of notes there wasn't you can watch it it's it's remarkable intellectual pyrotechnics there was just nothing that I couldn't throw at that guy it was really quite spectacular as we had not been interviewed in over a decade was the last interview he gave but his book democracy incorporated and then his masterpiece politics and vision are kind of seminal works and politics and vision is often considered by political scientists as one of the great political books on political philosophy produced in America and the 20th century and I think that's not hyperbolic Wallen calls the system inverted totalitarianism and that he means that like the late roman republic you still have the facade you have the the iconography the language the institutions of an open society of a democratic state but internally corporations have seized all of the levers of power to render the citizen impotent and of course what that does anytime a cabal seizes power whether it's Minh Arkell communist fascist corporate is and redirects all of the systems of government and institutions towards their own empowerment and enrichment then you you you get a form of political paralysis the political system seizes up it no longer responds to the rights and legitimate grievances of the citizenry and in fact extracts more and more and more out of a population that is already under deep distress and of course that is what has happened and that's one of the reasons why it's important to get out to places like Indiana or buy right out of Scranton Pennsylvania where the city went bankrupt or almost went bankrupt and they had to sell off all of their utilities their sewer system this is not uncommon throughout de-industrialized centers in the United States and of course corporations buy it up and then jack up the prices and these are gotting the IFRIC it's in the book I can't remember the average per capita income per family is like forty thousand dollars a year or something that's pence not much and and so you're extracting more and more and more from a population that has less and less and less and that is the process I mean clump Trump sorry Trump is as of course turbocharged the kleptocracy but it was there before he came in and and so what we're facing and what we're producing and what's ahead of us is the inevitable collapse of the American Empire all of the warning signs that have brought down other empires throughout history are flashing red within the American Empire and I'll just take a few of those off one is the political paralysis the inability of the system to address the the injustice --is the economic deprivation the loss of rights of the population and in fact to make it worse the other of course is something that even Bernie Sanders doesn't like to talk about and that is the bloated militarism and imperialism that is hollowing the country out from the inside so you have now 17 years of warfare in the Middle East there's a term at RF people have read Alfred McCoy wrote a good book I think it's called this American Century is a great historian but he talks about what he calls micro militarism it's a term that historians use and what it is is that late empires inevitably overreach they carry out acts of military folly in an effort to recapture a lost power so for instance the in the Athenian Empire they invade Sicily their entire fleet is sunk thousands of soldiers are killed and the Empire unravels their revolts throughout the empire or you look at the slow decline of the British Empire which really began at the end of World War one but culminated in 1956 when Nasser nationalizes the Suez Canal and the British invade attempt to invade and and going back to socco's book the Israelis take over Gaza for a hundred days and carry out wholesale massacres which is what his book is about footnotes in Gaza and and they have an Eisenhower and will not support them largely because he won't give them credit to carry out this act of military adventurism and they retreat in humiliation and then what happens is the pound sterling is dropped as the world's reserve currency and that of course is the deathblow of the american empire which is going to happen one day the the once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency the the economy seizes up imports become phenomenally expensive we can't live off of the sale of Treasury bonds and because nobody wants them and you can look at what happened to the British economy in the 50s if you want to know what's coming and so you have a situation where you're squeezing your population harder and harder and harder for less and less and less and and this is a characteristic with Joseph Tainter writes about it in his great study the collapse of complex societies where he looks at I think it's 24 different civilizations but he talks about that final moment when the elites retreat to the equivalent of the Forbidden City or Versailles or in our country it's what a writer in The New Yorker called richest Stan which means you fly on private jets and you never have any contact at all with anybody who doesn't make a few million dollars ear and and so they have no connection with the reality and they squeeze in this case of course it's through debt peonage you know they borrowed all these banks all goldman sachs which is a criminal organization goldman sachs all of these corporations were able to borrow from the Fed trillions of dollars I mean there's various numbers for seven and at virtually zero percent interest but it does have to be paid back and so how is it paid back it's it's extracted from us that's 1.4 trillion dollars in student debt that is you're late on your credit card it's 28% that is you know even if you have health insurance as anyone who has it can tell you the costs keep rising astronomically in terms of copay what they don't cover what the the pharmaceutical industry which can jack up our you know the mile on but that's just one of many examples in the in the EpiPen so so you're extracting more and more from a population and how do you how do you deal with this kind of calcification or failed see and that is that at the same time you strip citizens of their rights you you reinterpret constitutional rights you overturn them by judicial Fiat so for instance with Citizens United which allows the Koch brothers to control with dark money or Sheldon Adelson these figures are elections it becomes the right to petition the government or a form of free speech this is this is how citizens united is justified Edward Snowden exposes the fact that we are the most surveilled watched monitored eavesdropped population in human history and I covered the Stasi state in East Germany and of course nothing is done to restore the constitutional right of privacy and if you wonder why it's so dangerous that they have everything on every one of us including medical records you go back to Hannah Arendt's great book origins of totalitarianism and she writes about how despotic governments take information or have files information on every citizen so that at the moment that they seek to criminalize that person or a group they can twist whatever information they have to justify it as a crime we also have courtesy of Barack Obama's signing of the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act section 1021 which overturns the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act which had before prohibited the military from acting as a domestic police force and as some of you may know I sued Obama in federal court and to the chagrin of the national security state one and the very courageous judge Katherine Forrest ruled in our favor and issued a temporary injunction and I within hours of that injunction lawyers from the NSA and had flown up and demanded in the name of national security that she reinstate this act now this act allows the military to seize US citizens stripped them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military facilities and in her opinion which is worth reading she said this opens the path for the government to criminalize an entire group of people and she cites the 110,000 japanese-americans who were interned in World War two you militarized police forces and you create legal and physical mechanisms among demon ah the demonized segments of your population so that at a moment that the country becomes restive with a flick of a switch you can impose martial law or tyranny so in marginal communities you have already reins of terror 94% of the people in our prison system never get a jury trial they're forced to plea out and I have taught her in prison for 10 years and my the students I have with the longest sentences invariably went to trial did not commit the crime for which they are charged went to trial though many people who are forced to plea guilty didn't commit the crime and nobody deserves almost no one in the system deserves the length of sentences or the conditions they're held under and and they get the longest sentences because it has is a message sent to everyone else which is basically don't try this I mean they won't peel off the the charges and that's how a plea works they stack all sorts of try and they know you didn't do it I mean they love to put kidnapping on no matter what you did because it's 25 years so and and it will go back to Aaron so Aaron writes about she herself is expelled from Germany strip diverse German citizenship find yourself in France and writes about the plight of the stateless and she said once you create a mechanism within your society whereby for a segment of that society rights become privileges and we see it with what's happening to undocumented people around us then you have the infrastructure and the legal tools so that those privileges can be taken away from everyone and let's be very clear just to conclude that these corporate our corporate masters will stop at nothing if they feel that their profits are being impeded and the great example of that and I was out there as standing rock so here you had a nonviolent protest by water protectors to safeguard their own not only their water but their land and the response of the state this was under Obama was incredible incredibly violent so over 700 arrests the use of attack dogs we're all talking about nonviolent protesters sub-freezing temperatures you're using water cannons laced with pepper spray against people constant infiltration and this is something that I keep telling the kids who I loved in Zuccotti they weren't quite aware of the extent to which the state is able to monitor and infiltrate although there were moments in Zuccotti when it was out of a Doonesbury cartoon because some guy who clearly lifted weights and was in his 30s would show up in a baseball cap and and tell everyone he was at Reed College but he forgot his ID card and the question was always the same after a few a little chitchat he goes so who are the leaders that was all with him and I mean the great the power of occupy was that everything was transparent we're not going to win this game unless we're transparent and it gets the whole issue if somebody wanted to ask about it about non-violence which is the only way we're going to win this game and so I remember one of these cops went to the head of the medical it was a medical tent in there and said to the woman running in the medical tent so eventually came us so who are the leaders and she goes I am he goes oh really he goes well what's your title she goes god but what's not funny is that because these activists were using electronic media but you know digital communication they knew who was important and after the under Obama coordinated national effort they shut down occupy which for me was one of the great tragedies of our time because if the state had responded rationally to the very moderate demands of the Occupy movement forgiving student debt universal health care a jobs program especially targeted people under the age of 25 it would have actually gone a long way to ameliorating the pressure which has now only gotten worse but unfortunately the state did not respond rationally and I know I'm a little over but just let me close by talking about Trump Trump is the symptom he's not the disease and I watched this same kind of political deformity and deterioration in Yugoslavia and you can go back and look at vimar Eric vogelin writes about it in the in Hitler and the Germans where he talks about how you know this idea that Hitler mesmerised or hypnotizes ridiculous what it tapped into was a kind of in Kohei rage and frustration and sense of betrayal because after the 1929 crash the socialist government the social-democrats under Ebert in Vai Mar imposed the same kinds of programs of austerity that were pushed on him by the banks so they even suspended if you can believe it unemployment insurance people could even get unemployment insurance and that Nazis were in twenty eight were polling in the single digits after the crash of course and and the policy of austerity and I and then it gets into the whole we can go back to Rosa Luxemburg on the fry Corps and all that but the they they people embraced these figures who were everybody knew they were buffoonish in the same way that everyone knows Trump is buffoonish as the same way that everybody knew Radovan Karadzic are slobodan milosevic our friend your twos men were buffoonish because they because of the anger at the system and my fear as I watched the Democratic Party and the mainstream commercial media is that they don't get it they continue to play this reality show game did Russia try and interfere that well yeah probably but Trump is not a product of of Russian interference Trump is a product of grotesque social inequality and of course the Democratic Party doesn't want to address that issue because they are an appendage of corporate power yes they're not the they are in the spectrum of corporate power that doesn't want to be identified as a racist or xenophobe or a homophobe but they do nothing to halt the cannibalization of corporations Nord and and of course that a part of that is the wars that we are waging it makes no sense to remain with the Taliban now controls more territory in Afghanistan they did than they did when we went in so why are we still there well I mean look at the stock prices of Raytheon Halliburton you know cruise missile costs what 1.1 million dollars let's drop 50 of them on Libya it's it's good for money it's good for profit for the war industry but it's not good for anyone over there and it's certainly not good for us and then I guess I'll happy to take any any questions anyone else [Applause] and I agree with you for the most part it's very depressing and you didn't even mention climate you know I didn't it's in the book that's the pick-me-up chapter but I think I'm older than you and yes you know the empires have collapsed but this happened very quickly I mean within the scope of my lifetime I was born in the 40s I grew up in the 50s in Massachusetts and the country was on a roll not everyone not not the blacks in the south we didn't know about well I didn't know about it but the people who were left had gotten through the depression they had gotten through the war they had been led by Roosevelt and we felt that progress was just inevitable and in the 60s because the country was doing so well it seemed okay to open things up my late husband was at the EEOC the whole idea was to be more inclusive and it all sort of began to turn in 1980 or in the 70s with Nixon in 1980 with Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman which gave you this corporate culture but it's happened so fast that I don't see why it can't still be turned around okay I mean it's a good question it started actually earlier because it started with I mean you had the collapse of capitalism in the 1930s right Roosevelt was a product of the radical movements the Communist Party we've kind of erased the Communist Party from American history I'm not a communist but they you know the whole whole sit-ins that Martin Luther King used you know Ruskin was aware of this they'd been be used in the 1920s by the Communist Party would you and that's why paul robeson or w/e two boys join the Communist Party because even the Socialists under Debs were hostile to African Americans and and so we Roosevelt astutely understood I mean Roosevelt said that his greatest achievement was that he saved capitalism and he understood that if the private sector didn't create jobs for American citizens given the unemployment good job we better create jobs so he created twelve minute jobs if if elderly people are slit early starving and malnourished in their apartments then we better create Social Security and the corporate oligarchs made two fatal mistakes one they went after the radicals in the they recreated the red scares of the 1920s in the 1950s and Shrek err Ellen trekker has written two very fine books on this and you forget how pervasive that purging was and we're not talking about necessarily Communists we're talking about anybody with a social conscience so the FBI was going into high schools with a list this is in trekkers book saying him him hurt her out no evidence nothing and they're blacklisted the the assault on journalism it's how I have stone ends up in his basement writing I have stones weekly the assault on Hollywood on entertainment so that began to destroy the the the popular radical movements which has in points out were the forces that opened up our democracy we had a we have a closed system every time I hear by the deification of the founding fathers I just want to fall over I'm these people were racist they supported the genocide I mean read what they wrote about eradicating the Indians Washington was the wealthiest man in the United States they were misogynist you know on and on and on and we paid for with blood we had the bloodiest labor Wars of any industrialized country so they went after the radical movements then they went after the liberal class and I wrote a book on it called death of the liberal class where and as Chomsky points out I told Noam for the liberal class everything I learned about the liberal class I learned from Noam Chomsky so I should have put by Chris Hedges and Noam Chomsky except I didn't get his permission to do it as Chomsky points out the liberal class was never designed to be the political left it was designed to be the safety valve what Karl Popper writes about in the the enemies of the open society it was designed to ameliorate to adjust the system the way Roosevelt did and so they have Visser ated the liberal establishment and then we got the great traitor of liberalism Bill Clinton who really sold American people down the river oh and we can just take it off NAFTA the greatest betrayal of working men and women since the taft-hartley Act deregulating the FCC so these troglodytes from Clear Channel and Fox News can consolidate control we have about six corporations are five control 90% of what people listen to and it's indoctrinated trap talk about it's fake news I mean real fake news he passes the 94 omnibus crime bill so the prison population explodes from 700,000 he destroys glass-steagall he destroys welfare and 70% of the original recipients in the old welfare program were children and every time I heard Hillary Clinton talk about her concern for mothers so and Obama went any better but that's another story so that the the the we we created this it was a gradual process and in that process we D industrialized so as Charles Mayer the Harvard historian says by the 1970s we had shifted from an empire of production to an empire of consumption meaning that we were borrowing to maintain both a lifestyle and a military we could no loan afford and now we're paying for it that's a long answer go ahead thank you I agree with every word that you spoken tonight mm-hmm but I want to pick up with what that lady said at the very end we must not get defeatist we have to think that there is a way out of this and to describe it is very important but we have to start structuring our thought I mean for example all of us are many people are in the system so there excuse me there is a leverage of people to change their minds to change the philosophy and I'd like you to speak a little bit about that because I don't want us to get so down that we really think we can't I mean this this gets to the whole issue of hope I you know I come out of war I spent 20 years covering war i I don't share the cultures mania for hope I heard very bleak situations I was in Sarajevo during the war and my job as a war correspondent was to make a very cold rational calculation about the weapons systems around me and the possibility for destruction and then to act and we mentioned she mentioned climate change which I haven't spoken about but I mean we've known about climate change since 1902 and we've done nothing which kind of implodes the New Atheists now I can't the Chomsky calls them the religious fanatics for the state religion sam harris etc the the it implodes this idea that we're rational human beings and I think that you know Reinhold Niebuhr has her are you inside no let me are you in such despair yourself I mean there's not as a criticism but have you given up so much hope but I have but but the fact is you can't use the word hope if you don't resist oh but and so we have to we have to ca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ry out because the very act of resistance or rebellion at that moment makes you a free human being but at the same time it doesn't do us any good not to grasp the crisis the the the mortal crisis that we face not only as a nation but as a species and I think that is the great existential struggle of the whereby we we have to see reality for what it is and then we have to resist but most people who rebel the great you know the great rebels Toussaint L'Ouverture are Sitting Bull or Malcolm or they they you know but in the eyes of the world they didn't succeed but in fact what they did is hold up that other narrative and I would then go into my own background as a seminarian I once asked Daniel Berrigan the great radical priest and poet how he defined faith and he said faith is the belief that the good draws to it the good even if empirically everyone everything around us says otherwise and I think that if we are going to resist successfully we are going to have to do so in a not in an orthodox way emma goldman fundamentally i think had a deep religious impulse we are going to have to believe as beragon says that the good draws to it the good even if empirically everything around us gets worse but you know Sartre writes about it the the utopianism of the practical I can't remember his exact phrase my son's here you can tell us but III we are gonna have to see how dire it is and look I'm not the only one in this room who has kids and even if we fail we have to I want my kids to look back and say he tried so I think on the one hand we do have to face how bleak it is on the other hand we can't let that despair cripple us but I look at this you know this kind of inevitable human progress or technology will save us as as foolish as the denial of global warming thank you [Applause] two quick questions if Trump for a chance is impeached do you feel that the backlash could result in on civil strife and the second question is you are on RT and I do watch our tea for time time things I have some interesting programming but I do feel a little one-sided I was wondering what is your experience with art okay well in terms of Trump Trump skills go back to Noam Chomsky and he Trotsky says correctly that if we lose Trump and get Pence it's gonna be worse why because and that's why I mentioned my book on the Christian Right the the Trump has no ideology it's an ideological vacuum he doesn't I mean as far as I can tell he's in the early stages of dementia and it certainly appears that way Ronald Reagan had it but they covered it up a little better so what he is filling that vacuum with is the fascist ideology of the Christian Right and if you think it's not fascist flick on the TV and watch Sarah Sanders who lies like the day is long and then tells you what a great Christian she is I come back another time and talk about the Christian Right but let me just say at its core it's it's about heat at its core it's a very frightening movement it has all the hallmarks of a totalitarian movement and it is fused the Christian religion with the state which the German Christian Church did as far as RT excuse me uh isn't quite answered the question the question was if he's in peace will there be civil strife well yeah but I'm saying that one it'll be worse and I'm not sure that there will be civil strife because they will have pence pence is is a product of the Christian Right and while Trump caters to the Christian Right you have to remember the crib a have all these institutions they built Liberty University with its own law school and its own systems of indoctrination through cable channels and so IIIi don't think there'll be civil strife because in fact that Christianized fascism which this segment of the population yearns for will become more pronounced in terms of our tea look if we had a functioning public broadcasting system critics of corporate capitalism and imperialism would have a voice but PBS in particular is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Koch brothers and and and the destruction of public broadcasting in the 60s you could watch Baldwin Malcolm they were all on Zinn Chomsky it's vanished and so critics such as myself are being pushed to the margins not only of the electronic media landscape but the Internet now they've imposed all these algorithms in the name of fake news of course proper not thank you the Washington Post this anonymous site that listed us as tools of Russia right for TruthDig but all of the sites that reprint my stuff common dreams counterpunch they've all been targeted and alternate so you get what they call impression so before they impose the algorithms if you typed in imperialism and I had written an article recently on imperialism it would come up now it doesn't now we have we charted it in truth dig the impressions have fallen in the last year from over 700,000 to below 200,000 as they perfect the algorithm alternates traffic has fallen by 63% world socialist website then we have to add net neutrality and the question is why the reason is because nobody is buying this neoliberal crap this ideology read David Harvey spoke on neoliberalism that has just been a kind of ideological veneer for unadulterated greed by the 1% was your experience though well my experience is that they allow me you know to express these views remember I covered Eastern Europe so if you wanted to hear Vaslav Havel the only place you were gonna hear Havel was Voice of America Havel didn't support American imperialism or the US war but that was the only space that he had and I'm you know critics such as my gnomes completely blacked out Nader I mean these people are just blocked out and that's the goal and and once we throw in net neutrality on the goal is to create tears on the internet so that these left-wing sites become harder and harder to access go ahead so with our mainstream media increasingly corporatized and spewing out false narratives with no one speaking up about the fate of people like Julian Assange yeah with no one talking about what Edward Snowden tried to warn us about and with Google and Yahoo shutting down websites and d-flat do the platforming controversial sources every day how can we possibly extricate ourselves from this situation without any broad voice I mean there's there's no kind of well anything we can turn okay so it's not like there aren't huge segments of the population that are conscious I mean you see the group here tonight there are people who are conscious and they know they're being lied to and I you know in in the start let's go back to the Stasi state of East Germany or the old Czech Republic both of which I covered as I covered the Velvet Revolution so what was amazing was how conscious people were even with the imposition of the iron control of information so when the Velvet Revolution took place everyone knew that Havel and you know there's something about Havel I was in the Magic Lantern theater with him every night in Prague the interesting thing about habul is that he wasn't charismatic he wasn't a particularly good speaker but they knew he won gonna sell them out he had the moral authority oh and and I've told this story but I'll tell it again there there is you know and fear will make people quiet but they know and so that whole winter there were posters all over Prague of Yann Pollock who had a charles university student who to protest the 1968 Soviet invasion had gone to vents less square lit himself on fire four days later died of his burns they his funeral was which attracted hundreds of people mostly students was never broadcast by state media or covered his grave became a shrine they exhumed his remains cremated his remains gave them to his mother said she couldn't bury them that winter his poster was everywhere when the communist government fell 10,000 people marched to Red Army Square and renamed it Yan Pollock square mark tacuba shaiva the great singer sang the prayer from our toe the anthem of defiance that was broadcast on the airwaves as the Soviet tanks rolled in after the overthrow of Dubcek in the imposition of the pro-soviet government she her recording stock is destroyed she's banned from the airwaves between 1968 and 1989 she works at an assembly line at a toy factory I was invent celeste square she walked out on the balcony she began to sing the prayer for Marta and every check in that crowd knew every word that is the power of resistance what Auden calls the ironic point of light that flashes out wherever the just exchanged the messages and that's why tyrants and despots are terrified of the truth because people see it people feel it and there's more people out there that yeah I mean you're right I mean and they are trying to shut it down but the the lies are now so egregious and so transparent that you know a marginal critic such as myself suddenly becomes a threat because that truth is a threat and so totalitarian systems are quite effective at and the corporate state is quite effective at controlling the message but I and I just traveled all over the country for this book I can tell you people are far more conscious but with the internet completely in the power of these corporations and knowing everything about us and using it against us how can we know that wasn't around in in 1969 and this is what we face today how can we overcome that and and that parallel your experience you know as despotic regimes deteriorate they force resistance to create parallel systems so I write about Anderson Indiana where they these old former Catholic Worker people have bought a warehouse does the end of the book chapter freedom and they are literally because their stories are not told people trapped in the gig economy they literally print they print they print it up and write it and disseminate it I'm not saying I mean you're right to be concerned about it but that doesn't mean they're gonna win so broad question 2016 was probably the first time I had been politically engaged after being in the Army for some time and being deployed just that's a whole another world to even explain that to people that a culture that really doesn't want the story of what happens overseas in the name of empire to be told at all that's right um but where where does the left go from go from here um if I find it to be a very sad state Jill Stein's name has pretty much been drug through the mud she she can probably no longer effectively participate in the political system the Democratic Party as much as Ocasio Cortez seems like she'll bring change she she still has to go up against a huge apparatus yeah that will silence her I think where we go where do we go um we go to the street we look at people like Standing Rock we look at the all of the great radical movements that were shut out of power I mean we've gone through vicious periods of American history you know people I was I don't know if you know James Caan but if you don't you should read them cross Anna Lynch and we've just lost him just a most important theologian in America and one of the great moral voices of our time but as James kept saying you know people will say Malcolm was so radical Malcolm Malcolm said what he said in Harlem when King got up and said what he said in Montgomery it meant that the next day walking down the street he could be dead and I think that we have to uncover or find again with us that kind of moral courage represented by the great figures of resistance and we have to begin what we saw in South Africa which brought down apartheid which is non-cooperation we have to do everything in our power to build alternative structures to pit power against power and we have to do everything in our power to obstruct the workings of the corporate state and that's what the Wobblies did that's what the old CIO did that's what they did in the civil rights movement that's what the Communist Party did that's what the Progressive Party did we have antecedents they erase this from American history that's what the bonus marchers did which of course MacArthur went in and evicted them by force and you know we have the politics is a game of fear and we have to make them frightened of us that's our goal that's the only way they're kept in check so there's a passage in Kissinger's memoirs which hopefully is not being sold in this bookstore do not go buy it it's 1971 tens of thousands of anti-war protesters around the White House Nixon has put empty city buses and and around the White House's barricades and he's standing at the window looking out wringing his hands next to Kissinger going Henry they're going to break through the barricades and get us it's our job to make people in power feel fear that's our job and until we do that and believe me you know I so I have relatives who are on Wall Street and Zuccotti which was absolutely did not pose any physical threat to these predators on Wall Street they were terrified they wouldn't even go out for lunch they were getting they had all their private security firms tweeting or telling them every hour they're on Bond Street now they have a giant puppet octopus in front of Goldman Sachs you know really you know they're a lot you know you know why they're so scared because they know even better than we do how corrupt and fixed the system is that's why Bernanke was on his knee and unfortunately Obama didn't stand up for us he stood up for the bankers so that's it that's the only Hubbell we we didn't talked about climate change I mean that's why Standing Rock is so important that's why blocking the railroad tracks in the North West who are bringing down the pediment isn't that's what we got to do that's it and and and I think they they understand how hated they are and and that makes them weak and that's gets into the whole issue of violence as the great and they were talking about revolution by the way I'm talking about the overthrow of the corporate state and for the homeland security person who's here that's overthrow Oh Vee are because these people are going to kill us and they're gonna kill my children and and in the end you know they these corporate forces have us they have us by the throat and they have my kids by the throat and I don't know if we're gonna win I don't even know if we're gonna survive as a species but in the end I don't fight fascism because I win I fight fascists because they are fascists and that moral almost religious quality is one that we have to embrace what Niebuhr called sublime madness that understanding that radical evil must be opposed even if everything around us says that we will fail and when we find that and when we have the courage to stand up and defy it we may not win in an ultimate sense but we will be free I mean I teach in a prison they imposed a rule in the prison that although my students had to walk past the guards down the corridors with their eyes down and they refused they walk down the quarters with their eyes up it sounds a little but it's not that's what we have to do and we have to understand that not the Democratic Party no but no system now there are no institutions in this country left that are authentically democratic there are no institutions that are going to protect us or protect our children or protect the ecosystem on which we depend for life it's up to us and at least let us find that courage so that whatever generation comes after us will say they were not passive and they were not complicit as a fundamentalist say say on prophet I think you mister calling but that's why I came here tonight was to get the answer on dealing with despair and your latest article by the way in truth peg is about climate change yeah and you go all the way to the wall basically implying that no matter what we do we're gonna lose this battle and that's um I would like you to do an article and TruthDig about what you said tonight because I've never heard you say all this stuff before so I have said it before and and I but I think the point is I mean if we take the climate the global warming I mean just a factual understanding I mean even if we stop all carbon admissions today we are still going to be dealing with catastrophic effects of climate change and of course under the the Trump administration they're rolling back whatever tea pad before they have and we don't have any time left and I think part of it's an imperative for us to grasp how little time we have left I mean climate scientists are quite clear that once we get below 2% above 2% Celsius we may get into the kinds of feedback loops that have that create of the temperatures on Venus which are 800 degrees that that and it rains sulfuric acid um that that's where we are and and there is no serious climate scientist that disputes that and yet you know I think I talk about the mania for hope I think if we understood the emergency that we're in we might begin to react but it's of course it fills me I mean my youngest son will his favorite book is out of the blue so it's like NARR Wales and I'm thing it may very well and probably will be that in your lifetime everything single one of those species doesn't exist that's and I think that when we understand how precarious our situation is and stop fooling ourselves we will react and and it goes back to that sublime madness I mean that in the end it is most revolutionaries rebels throughout history don't succeed but we have to and and I think that way we actually overcome despair by resisting I mean I do I mean I was been a Ritz boutique a rat never heard that from that statement from you before I mean look you know I've been arrested in front of the White House I've been arrested in front of goldman sachs and it that that kind of solid eras rested with a hundred and thirty three vets in front of the White House and in the winter snowing and so as Vietnam vets Iraqi war vets Afghan vets and it was I mean it was a religious experience it was so moving these people knew the horror of war the poison of militarism and when it when it came time to walk to the White House fence and get arrested it's on YouTube somebody's beating a drum that's it nobody speaks in fact most of the people in the crowd are crying and when you sit home alone when you attempt as an individual to cope with the profound despair that we almost feel it will conquer you but when you build relationships and not electronically but the way relationships can only be built and that is person-to-person when you build community and when you carry out acts of resistance that act of resistance is the best antidote to despair thank you we have one more yes I I okay I actually had a serious question but it's I realized time is short basically you never hear anything about the money system in progressive discussions and I would love that to be addressed more not the money system he'll talk about banks and so on but it's much more complex than that but I do want to take this opportunity to thank you personally I realized as that progressive about two years ago that I could no longer continue to kill and exploit animals for my pleasure you know you don't get to talk about it that much but you inspired me to go vegan and it's it's changed my life completely so I just say thank you well let me if you care about climate change the animal agriculture industry many people argue is the greatest contributor to global warming and you can get up tomorrow and that's something you can do it's also healthier but that I mean it was it the environmental factor that pushed me to become vegan because whatever I do in my life it's it's an act it was an easy action to take and again it it is part of that assault that we all must carry out against corporate power and then we get into a whole issue of how they treat animals and the and the antibiotics they pump into them and everything else but yeah thank you for bringing that up I think it's an important thing that we can all do I am in light of your comments about resisting taking it to the streets shutting it down I know that buzzword now is we all need to choose civility but I just noticed when you when you began you've made some comments about the antifa demonstrators and they didn't sound very positive could you sort of expand on that a bit well I've written about it I movement I wrote about the black bloc and I call them the cancer of Occupy look the problem with an Tifa and the black bloc is that in the name of diversity of tactics they really only have one tactic they serve the interests of the state and the interests of the state is to demonize the resistance movement make people afraid of it and in infiltrated and I would argue that the huge percentage of these people are cops infiltrate it and get them to carry out acts of violence to justify state repression you want to know who wrote the best about an anarchist violence is Lenin he got it he understood how dangerous that was to the revolution and look resistance is not a form of catharsis it's a form it's tactics its strategic our job is to bring them down and as the great theorist of revolution crane Brinton Jeffrey Davies have all and others have pointed out no revolution succeeds and this was true in the revolutions I covered in Eastern Europe until a significant percentage of the the security apparatus and the civil bureaucracy defects because once they defect it creates paralysis so I was in East Germany you have demonstrations in leipzig erich honecker the communist dictator for 19 years sends down an elite paratroop division which is gonna fire on the crowd they get there the local communist authorities block it Hahn occurs out of power within a week that's because these people no I mean these you know I used to get in a battle about taunting the cops in Zuccotti and I remember kind of flippantly which I shouldn't have done you know saying to a group in Zuccotti the people who carried out the most egregious abuses in Zuccotti were the white church they were the officers once the white shirts weren't around the there was a lot of almost fraternization between the blue uniformed and the kids so I in this talk I said look you know you'll we only have to deal with the white shirts for a couple of these white shirt at assholes for a couple hours a day these cops have to deal with them all day long so they've shut down Zuccotti and I'm giving a talk in New York and at the end this man comes up to me and he goes I'm a white shirt at asshole and I read all of your books now he might be the only one but I shouldn't have said that because we will not succeed unless we bring with us substantial sections of those within the power system and look I think they passed section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act because ultimately the elites don't trust the police to protect them and when we in this two-year legal battle we went before the it was Obama appealed it to the Second Circuit the appellate and of course they were stuck because it's totally unconstitutional so they don't want to have to rule on it and they four months they sit on it sit on it and sit on it and I was also a plaintiff in clapper versus Amnesty International about wholesale surveillance before the Snowden revelations where government lawyers got up and said that I and the other plaintiffs were just speculating about government surveillance and then added if the government was monitoring them we would tell them okay so they threw it out because we didn't have standing that's the way they deny our rights and so then the Second Circuit said he doesn't have standing he can't bring the case and we filed a cert but during that whole to the Supreme Court they wouldn't take it but during that two-year battle we went to the Democratic leadership we went to Pelosi the lawyers we said look they passed section 1021 every year boy if they do is pass it and say it doesn't apply to u.s. citizens and we drop the lawsuit but of course they weren't going to put because it does apply to u.s. citizens and I forgot your question and Tifa oh yeah so an Tifa plays into what they want which is a militarized states and as I tell look I was overseas somebody that asked question was overseas he'll second me having been around special forces we have 60,"000 of them they're called death squads the state has the capacity to inflict levels of violence that we can't even begin to imagine and that's just a route that is utterly self-destructive and so I have been quite vocal in my attacks against an T from the Black Bloc because I see them as counterproductive to what we're trying to accomplish [Music] [Applause]

103,1,1980 Presidential Candidate Debate: Governor Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter - 10/28/80,"The full-length 1980 Presidential Candidate Debate between Governor Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter on 10/28/80.For more information on the ongoing works of President Reagan's Foundation, visit us at http://www.reaganfoundation.org",ReaganFoundation,_8YxFc_1b_0,"[""good evening I'm Ruth Heiner Feld of the League of Women Voters education fund next Tuesday is election day before going to the polls voters want to understand the issues and know the candidates positions tonight voters will have an opportunity to see and hear the major party candidates for the presidency state their views on issues that affect us all the League of Women Voters is proud to present this presidential debate our moderator is Howard K Smith Thank You mrs. Heine Feld the League of Women Voters is pleased to welcome to the Cleveland Ohio Convention Center Music Hall President Jimmy Carter the Democratic Party's candidate for re-election to the presidency and governor Ronald Reagan of California the Republican Party's candidate for the presidency the candidates will debate questions on domestic economic foreign policy and national security issues the questions are going to be posed by a panel of distinguished journalists who here with me they are Marvin stone the editor of US News and World Report Harry Ellis national correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor William Hilliard assistant managing editor of the Portland Oregonian Barbara Walters correspondent ABC News the ground rules for this is agreed by you gentlemen for these each panelists down here will ask a question the same question to each of the two candidates after the two candidates have answered a panelist will ask follow-up questions to try to sharpen the answers the candidates will then have an opportunity each to to make a rebuttal that will constitute the first half of the debate and I will state the rules for the second half later on some other rules the candidates are not permitted to bring prepared notes to the podium but are permitted to make notes during the debate if the candidates exceed the allotted time agreed on I will reluctantly but certainly interrupts we asked the Convention Center audience here to abide by one ground rule please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval during the debate now based on a toss of the coin governor Reagan will respond to the first question from Marvin stone governor as you're well aware the question of war and peace has emerged as a central issue in this campaign and the give-and-take of recent weeks President Carter's been criticized for responding late to agressive Soviet impulses for insufficient buildup of our armed forces and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran you have been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle military action to deal with foreign crises specifically what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power I don't know what the differences might be because I don't know what mr. Carter's policies are I do know what he has said about mine and I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace and that use of force is always and only a last resort when everything else has failed and then only with regard to our national security now I believe also that this meeting this mission is responsibility for preserving the peace which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader of the free world because we're the only one that can do it and therefore the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us and to maintain that peace requires strength America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong we can get into a war by letting events get out of hand as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this administration of mr. Carter's until we're faced each time with a crisis and good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis but I have seen four wars in my lifetime I'm a father of sons I have a grandson I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into Sandy Beach heads in the Pacific or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy blood of bloody fields of battlefields of Europe mr. stone do you have a follow-up question for the governor yes governor we've been hearing that the defense build-up that you would associate yourself with would cost tens of billions of dollars more than is now contemplated and assuming that the American people are ready to bear this cost they nevertheless keep asking the following question how do you reconcile huge increases in military outlays with your promise of substantial tax cuts and of balancing the budget which in this fiscal year when the just ended ran more than sixty billion dollars in the red mr. stone I have submitted an economic plan that I've worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country all of whom approve it and believe that over a five-year projection this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier and that we can't afford along with the cuts that I have proposed in government spending we can't afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years and on beyond that a tax increase that would be taking 86 billion dollars more next year out of the people's pockets than was taken this year and my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that 86 billion dollar increase I'm only reducing the amount of the increase in other words what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than governments been getting but simply cutting the increase the in in spending the same question now goes to President Carter President Carter would you like to have the question repeated yes President Carter the question of war and peace a central issue in this campaign you've been criticized for in the give-and-take for responding late to agressive Soviet impulses for an insufficient buildup of armed forces and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran Governor Reagan on the other hand has been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle military action to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned specifically what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power mr. stone have had to make thousands of decisions since I've been president serving in the Oval Office and with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country I have learned in the process I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated for years ago against President Ford I've also learned that they are no simple answers to complicated questions HL Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer it would be neat and plausible and wrong the fact is that this nation in the eight years before I became president had its own military strength decrease seven out of eight years the budget commitments for defense went down 37 percent in all since I've been in office we've had a steady carefully planned methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense but what we've done is to use that enormous power and and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace we've not only kept peace for our own country but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others in the Middle East we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt successfully and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability this is a very good step forward for our nation security and we will continue to do as we've done in the past I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every president which are profound in nature there are always trouble spots in the world and how those troubled areas are addressed by president alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly the involvement of the United States and also our American interests that is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every president who serves that's what I try to do successfully by keeping our country at peace mr. stone do you have a follow-up yes I would like to be a little more specific on the use military power and let's talk about one area for a moment under what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with for example a shut off of Persian oil Gulf if that should occur or to counter a Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan into either Iran or Pakistan I asked this question and view of charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustained and I emphasize the word sustained power in that part of the world missed out in my State of the Union address earlier this year I pointed out that any threat to the stability of security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country in the past we've not had an adequate military presence in that region now we have two major carrier task forces we have access to facilities in five different areas of that region and we've made it clear that working with our allies and others that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventualities which by interrupts commerce with that crucial area of the world but in doing this we have made sure that we address this question peacefully not injecting American military forces in the combat but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way this I believe has assured that our interest will be protected in the Persian Gulf region as we've done in the Middle East and throughout the world Governor Reagan you have a minute to comment or rebut well yes I questioned the figure about the decline in defense spending out of the two previous administrations in the preceding eight years to this administration I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace I also would like to point out the Republican presidents in those years faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut now Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38 percent cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed and stopped the b1 delayed the cruise missiles stopped the production line for the Minuteman missiles stopped the Trident sir delayed the Trident submarine and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use of force President Carter you have the last word on this question well there are various elements of Defense um one is to control nuclear weapons which I hope we'll get to later on because that's the most important single issue in this campaign another one is how to address troubled areas of the world I think habitually governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully diplomatically and through negotiation the addition of that the buildup of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength in order to preserve the peace but I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle strength is imperative for peace but the two must go hand in hand thank you gentlemen the next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter mr. president when you were elected in 1976 the consumer price index stood at 4.8% it now stands at more than 12% perhaps more significantly the nation's broader underlying inflation rate has gone up from seven to nine percent now a part of that was due to external factors beyond US control notably the more than doubling of oil prices by OPEC last year because the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks can inflation in fact be controlled if so what measures would you pursue in a second term again it's important to put the situation into perspective in 1974 we had a so-called oil shock wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree we had an even worse old shock in 1979 in 1974 we had the worst recession the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War the recession that resulted this time was a briefest we've had since the Second World War in addition we've brought down inflation early this year the first quarter we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase Everage to about 18% the first quarter this year the second quarter we had dropped it down to about 13 percent the most recent figures the last three months of the third quarter of this year the inflation rate is seven percent still too high but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of 9 million new jobs in the last three and a half years that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us I noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan Kemp Roth proposal which his own running mate George Bush described as boudu economics and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate and Businessweek which is not a democratic publication said that this Reagan contra proposal and I quote them I think was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation so our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs to improve the industrial complex of this country to create tools for American workers and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature so to add 9 million new jobs to control inflation and to plan for the future was a energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead mr. Ellis do you have a follow-up question from mr. Carter yes mr. president you have mentioned the creation of 9 million new jobs at the same time the unemployment rate still hangs high as does the inflation rate now I wonder can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate and would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they're going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come yes we have demanded that the American people sacrifice and they've done very well as a matter of fact we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago we've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office at the same time as I said earlier we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time a record never before achieved also the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors one conservation which requires sacrifice and the other one increase in production of American energy which is going along very well more coal this year than ever before in history more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history a new economic revitalization program that we have in mind which will be implemented next year would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs about a million in the next two years and we also have planned a Youth Employment Program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people this has already passed the House now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate now the same question goes to governor Reagan governor Reagan would you like to have the question repeated governor Reagan during the past four years the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8% to currently over 12% and perhaps more significantly the nation's broader underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent now a part of that has been due to external factors beyond US control and notably the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year which leads me to ask you whether since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks can inflation in fact be controlled if so specifically what measures would you pursue mr. Ellis I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people when mister Carter became president inflation was 4.8% as you said it had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford it is now running at twelve point seven percent President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created what we always with the normal growth in our country an increase in population increase the number of jobs but that can't hide the fact that there are 8 million men and women out of work in America today and 2 million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation and yet his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation because of in January at the beginning of the year it was more than 18% since then he has blamed to the people for inflation OPEC he's blamed the Federal Reserve System he has brained the lack of productivity the American people he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less we don't have inflation because the people are living too well we have inflation because the government is living too well and the last statement just a few days ago was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because government revenues have not kept pace with government spending I see my time is running out here I'll have to get this down very fast yes you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets and are no longer running grinding out printing press money flooding the market with it because the government is spending more than it takes in and my economic plan calls for that the president's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way but we'll have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path follow-up mr. Ellis yes you have centered on cutting government spending in what you have just said about your own policies you have also said that you would increase defense spending specifically where would you cut government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes so that presumably federal revenues would shrink well most people when they think about cutting government spending they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something some service that government is supposed to perform I believe that there is enough extravagance in fact in government as a matter of fact one of the secretaries of hgw under mr. Carter testified that he thought there was 7 billion dollars worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it we've had the General Accounting Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone and they have added that waste adds even more to that we have a program for a gradual reduction of government spending based on these theories and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California and inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned money to the people and reduced government spending President Carter Governor Reagan's proposal the Riggin Kim Roth proposal is one of the most highly inflationary ideas it ever has been presented to the American public he would actually have to cut government spending by at least a hundred and thirty billion dollars in order to balance of budget under this ridiculous proposal I noticed that his task force is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in the Wall Street Journal this week one of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage and several times this year governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage this is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country which is typical of many Republican leaders in the past but I think has been accentuated under governor Reagan in California I'm surprised governor Reagan brought this up he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration he more than doubled state spending while he was governor 122 percent increase and had between a twenty and thirty percent increase in the number of employees sarahdan in California - thank you sir it's governor Reagan has the last word on this question yes the figures that the president has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there because while I was governor of California our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while mr. Carter was governor of Georgia in the same four years the size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to population in Georgia and the idea that my tax cut proposal is inflationary I would like to ask the president why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they'd like and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants I wish that question need not be rhetorical but it must be because we run out of time on that now the the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard yes governor Reagan the decline of of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime strange race relations to fall in the quality of public education the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation and a decline in the services to the public the signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities what specifically would you do in the next four years to reverse this trend I have been talking to a number of congressmen who have much the same idea that I have and that is that in the inner city areas that in cooperation with local government and with national government and using tax incentives and wouldn't Kapil cooperation with the private sector but we have development zones let the local entity the city declare this particular area based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare unemployed and so forth in that area and then through tax incentives induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas the elements of government through these tax incentives for example a business that would not have for a period of time an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax that now and it would simply be a delay and on the other hand many of the people that would then be given jobs are presently Ward's of the government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive because they that wouldn't be costing government anything either I think there are things to do in this regard I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot the President Carter stood on in 1977 you have to see it to believe it it looks like a bombed out city great gaunt skeletons of buildings windows smashed out painted on one of them unkept promises on another despair and this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department there are hope for this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare just bulldoze down flat and nothing has been done and they are now charging to take tourists through there to see this terrible desolation I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again nothing has been done follow-up mr. Hilliard yes governor Reagan blacks and other non-whites are increasing in numbers in our cities many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society there is racial confrontation in the schools on jobs and in housing is non-white seek to reap the benefits of a free society what do you think is the nation's future as a multiracial society I believe in it I am eternally optimistic and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city when there's hopelessness at at home lack of work and so forth but I believe that all of us together and I believe the presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was it's a bully pulpit and I think that something can be done from there because the goal for all of us should be that one day things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us ethnic differences or racial justice differences whatever they may be that we will have total equal opportunity for all people and I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about mr. Hilliard would you repeat your question for President Carter President Carter the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime strained race relations the fall in the quality of public education the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation and a decline in services to the public the signs seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities what specifically would you do in the next four years to reverse this trend Thank You mr. Yeo when I was campaigning in 1976 everywhere I went the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation we initiated a very fine urban renewal program working with the mayors the governors and other interested officials this has been a very successful effort that's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in a number of people employed other nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans and another million among those who speak Spanish we're now planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of Rapid Transit mass transit under the windfall profits tax we expect to spend about forty three billion dollars in the next ten years to rebuild a transportation systems of our country we also are pursuing the housing programs we've had a 73% increase and the allotment of federal funds for improved education these are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders particularly in a minority areas of essential cities that had been deteriorating so in the past it's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens I brought into that level top levels of government into the white house into administrative offices of the executive branch in it into the judicial system highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded I noticed that governor Reagan said it when he was a young a man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem we have gone a long way toward correcting these problems but we still have a long way to go the follow-up question this President Carter liked me see repeat the same follow-up to you blacks and other non-whites are increasing in numbers in our cities many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society there is racial confrontation in the schools on jobs and in housing is non-white seek to reap the benefits of a free society what is your assessment of the nation's as a future in multiracial society ours is a nation of refugees a nation of immigrants almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes which are being realized for a better life preserving their ethnic commitments they are family structures their religious beliefs preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries but still filming themselves together in a very coherent society which gives our nation and strength in the past those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government since I've been president I've appointed for instance more than twice as many black federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country I've done the same thing in the appointment of women's and also spanish-speaking Americans to involve them in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to this sanal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and an executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and continue to do so in the future governor Reagan you have a minute for rebuttal yes the president talks of government programs and they have their place but as governor when I was at that end of the line in receiving some of these grants for government programs I saw that so many of them were dead end they were public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future now the president spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black and who were telling me about their unemployment problems and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get and indeed every time it is increased you will find that there was an increase in minority unemployment among young people and therefore I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them with regard to the great progress that has been made with his government spending the rate of black unemployment in Detroit Michigan is 56 percent President Carter you have the last word on this question well it's obviously we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life we have made good progress and there's no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation the minimum wage welfare national health insurance those kinds of commitments that have typify the Democratic Party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future in all those elements Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them which to me shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprive families a better chance in life this to me is a very important difference between him and me in this election and I believe the American people will judge accordingly there is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities with the with the new commit on an energy policy with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient with a chance for synthetic synthetic fuels program solar power this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends thank you gentlemen now for the fourth question to President Carter from Barbara Walters mr. president the eyes of the country tonight are on the hostages in Iran I realize this is a sensitive area but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis other countries have policies that determine how they will respond Israel for example considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists for the future mr. president the country has the right to know do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things different",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
y if this was something similar happens again probably one of the blights on this world is a threat and the activities of terrorists at one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the Western world we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment there is no doubt that we have seen in recent years in recent months additional acts of violence against Jews in France and of course against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations ultimately the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations who believe in terrorism in a policy should have atomic weapons both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons in countries like Libya or Iraq we have even a donated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries when Governor Reagan has been asking then he makes a very disturbing comment that non-proliferation or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons is none of our business and when he was asked specifically recently about Iraq he said there's nothing we can do about it this ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds ms walters follow-up yes while we are discussing policy header an not taken American hostages I assume that in order to preserve our neutrality we would have stopped the flow of spare parts and vital war materials once war broke out between Iraq and Iran now we are free to lift the ban on such Goods if they let our people come home doesn't this reward tourism compromise our neutrality and possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us in the Middle East we will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war we have no plans to sell additional material or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature when I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of a taking of our hostages I then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns which they have bought and paid for also that the frozen Iranian assets would be released that's been a consistent policy one I intend to carry out but you repeat the question now for governor Reagan please miss Walters yes governor the eyes of the country tonight remain on the hostages in Iran but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis there are other countries that have policies that determine how they will respond Israel for example considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists for the future the country has the right to know do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this was something similar should happen again Barbara you there's that question twice I think you ought to have at least one answer to it I am I have been accused of lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages now this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press which is that the question would be have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there and I said well yes and I think that anyone that's seeking this position as well as other people probably have thought to themselves what about this what about that these are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information in which I would know all the options that were open to me I have never answered the question however second the one that says well tell me what are some of those ideas first of all I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations and thus expose it and endanger the hostages and sometimes I think some of my ideas might involve quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance or say to anyone what it is you're thinking of doing your question is difficult to answer because in the situation right now no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay in any way the return of those hostages if they're if there is a chance of their coming home soon or that might cause them harm what I do think should be done once they are safely here with their families and that tragedy is over and we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now then I think it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning why they have been there so long and when they come home what did we have to do in order to bring that about what arrangements were made and I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation in the meantime I'm going to continue praying they'll come home follow-up question I would like to say that neither candidate answered specifically the question of a specific policy for dealing with terrorism but I will ask governor Reagan a different to follow-up question you've had suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been president because we would have given firmer support to the Shah but around is a country of 37 million people who are resisting a government they regarded as dictatorial my question is not whether the Shahs regime was preferable to the ayatollahs but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have and do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States the degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism I should say in the alternative government makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people and we've been guilty of that because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights even though they were an ally of ours instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways we have in a number of instances aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism instead for those people and I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when at the same time we are maintaining a date on with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all the Soviet Union now there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that and that was we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy and we could have done what other embassies did either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place the other one I'm sorry I must interrupt President Carter you have a minute for rebuttal I didn't hear any comment from governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future what the Western Allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights commercial air flights to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of airplanes of the harboring of high jackers secondly we all committed ourselves as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives third not to make any sales of material or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities and lastly not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace these are a few of the things to which our nation is committed and we will continue with these commitments Governor Reagan you have the last word on that question yes I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind and while I have a last word here I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the president's I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation or the trying to halt it would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine thank you gentlemen that is the first half of the debate now the rules for the second half quite simple they're only complicated when I explain them the second half the panel is with me we'll have no follow-up questions instead after the panelists have asked a question the candidates have answered each of the candidates will have two opportunities to follow up to question to rebut or just a comment on his opponent statement governor Reagan will respond in this section to the first question from Marvin stone governor Reagan arms control the president said it was the single most important issue both of you who have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia but by methods that are vastly different you suggest that we scrap the salt 2 treaty already negotiated and intensify the build-up of American power in to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to us yes President Carter on the other hand says he will again a try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty and the grounds it's the best we can hope to get now both of you cannot be right will you tell us why you think you are yes I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy a strong America and a strong economy and then as we build up our national security to restore our margin of safety we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet buildup which has been going forward a rapid pace and for quite some time the salt 2 treaty was the result of negotiations and mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons and his emissary I think came home in 12 hours with having heard a very definite net but taking that one no from the Soviet Union we then went back into negotiations on their terms because mister Carter had canceled the b-1 bomber delayed the MX delayed the Trident submarine delayed the cruise missile shut down the missile man the three the Minuteman missile production line and whatever other things that might have been done the Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral considerate concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever now I have not blocked the salt ii treaty as carter mr. Mondale suggests that I have it has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority indeed the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0 with 7 abstentions against the salt 2 treaty and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States besides which it is illegal because the law of the land passed by Congress says we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal and we're not equal in this treaty for one reason alone our b-52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons their backfire bombers are not the governor I have to interrupt you at that point the time's up for that but the same question now to President Carter yes President Carter both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms wave race with Russia but through vastly different methods the governor suggests we scrap the salt 2 treaty which you negotiated in Vienna are signed in Vienna and intensify the build-up of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to us you on the other hand say you will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians you cannot both be right will you tell us why you think you are yes I'd be glad to inflation unemployment the cities all very important issues but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a president when compared with the control of nuclear weapons every president who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons to negotiate with the Soviet Union balanced controlled observable and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan he has never supported any of those arms control agreements the limited test ban salt one nor that the the anti-ballistic missile treaty nor the Vladivostok treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union over a seven-year period by myself and my two Republican predecessors the Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty there have been preliminary skirmishing x' in the Committees of the Senate but the treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote it's understandable that a senator in the preliminary debate can make an irresponsible statement or maybe an ill-advised statement you've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake if it is a mistake but when a man who hopes to be president says take this treaty discard it do not vote do not debate do not explore the issues do not finally capitalize on this law negotiation that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing governor Reagan you have an opportunity to rebut that yes I'd like to respond very much first of all the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements is because we've been out negotiated for quite a long time and they have managed in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation to to go forward with the biggest military buildup in the history of man now to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the sole Trudy treaty that puts them on its side I would like to say a president Ford who was within 90 percent of an a tree of treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office is emphatically against this salt treaty I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty I am NOT talking of scrapping I am talking of taking the treaty back and going back into negotiations and I would say to the Soviet Union we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other that is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation President Carter yes governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements he not only advocates the scrapping of his treaty and I don't know that these men as he quotes or against the treaty in his final form but he also advocates the possibility he said it's been a missing element of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union if president Brezhnev said we will scrap this treaty negotiated under three American presidents over a seven-year period of time we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations it's obvious that I as president and all Americans would reject such a proposition this would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race it would be very disturbing to American people it would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War with all presidents Democratic and Republican and would also be very disturbing to our allies all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty in addition of that the adversarial relationship between ourselves in the Soviet Union would undoubtedly terior eight very rapidly this attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in his tone although it's said with a quiet voice Governor Reagan I know the president's supposed to be replying to me but sometimes I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying with what I have said or what my positions are sometimes think it's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure little work the my point I have made already mr. president with regard to negotiating it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States it is calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons as I say to the point that neither of us can represent a threat to the other and to suggest that the salt to treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous presidents is just not true it was a new negotiation because as I say President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable and I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable salt agreement President Carter you have the last word on this question I think to close out this discussion it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about I had a discussion with my daughter Amy the other day before I came here to ask you what the most important issue was she said she thought nuclear weaponry city and the control of nuclear arms this is a formidable force some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion if you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars you would have a car load of TNT a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation that's one major war explosion in a warhead we have thousands equivalent of Megaton or million tons of TNT warheads the control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a president and to cast down this commitment of all presidents because of some slight technicalities it can be corrected is a very dangerous approach we have to go to another question now from Harry Ellis to President Carter mr. president as you have said Americans through conservation are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago yet u.s. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo and for some time to come the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the u.s. into depression now this means that a bridge must be built out of this dependence can the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families I don't think is it in doubt that in the future the cost of oil is going to go up what I've had is a basic commitment since I've been as president is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil it can only be done in two ways one to conserve energy to stop the waste of energy and secondly to produce more American energy we've been very successful in both cases we've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third we imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same day just a year ago this commitment has been opening up a very bright Vista for our nation in the future because with the windfall profits tax as a base we now have an opportunity to use American technology an American ability an American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels yes to expand rapidly the production of solar energy yes and also to produce a conventional kinds of American energy we will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history will produce more coal this year than any year in history we are exporting more coal this year than any year in history and we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems improved loading facilities in our ports to see a very good opportunity on a world international market to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source this exciting future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have Milly of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we put into effect would you repeat the question now for governor Reagan governor Reagan Americans through conservation are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago and yet us reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo and the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression the question is whether the development of alternative energy sources in order to reduce this dependence can be done without damaging the environment and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy poor when it is energy rich the coal that the president mentioned yes we have it and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now the mines are closed down there are 22,"000 miners out of work most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it with our modern technology yes we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act I think as technology improves we'll be able to do even better with that the other thing is that we have only leased out and begun to explore 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found our government has in the last year or so taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were while there were public lands subject to multiple use exploration for minerals and so forth it is believed that probably percent of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out of it is there this is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska nuclear power there were 36 power plants planned in this country and let me add the word safety it must be done with the utmost of safety but 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build and again because government regulations and permits and so forth take make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe we have the sources here we are energy rich and coal is one of the great potentials we have President Carter your comment yes sir to repeat myself we have this year the opportunity which will realize to produce 800 million tons of coal an unequaled record in the history of our country governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land we cannot cast aside those regulations we have a chance in the next 15 years insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards to triple the amount of coal we produce Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy which is already proven its effectiveness is to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profits tax to return a major portion of 227 billion dollars back to the oil companies to do away with the Department of Energy to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program to put a minimal mm emphasis on solar power to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future he wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies governor Reagan that is a misstatement of course of my position I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job producing the things that people need then government can the Department of Energy has a multi-billion dollar budget in excess of ten billion dollars it hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy and for the mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air and so forth as governor of California I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted in the United States and we created an OSHA an occupational safety and health agency for the protection of employees before the federal government had one in place and to this day not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged so I think some of those charges are missing the point I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business and indeed very much of our personal lives that are unnecessary that government can do without that it added 130 billion dollars to the cost of production in this country and that are contributing their part to inflation and I would like to see us a little more free as we once were President Carter another crack at that sure as a matter of fact the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan and this is a very well-known fact also recently when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished governor Reagan responded amen the offshore drilling rights is a question that governor Reagan raises often as a matter of fact in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation a hundred percent of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration and ninety-five percent of all the Alaska lands where it is suspected or believe that mineral minerals might exist we have with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954 so we are not putting restraints on American exploration we're encouraging it in every way we can governor Reagan you have the last word on this question yes if it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the federal government tried to impose on the state of California not a law regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city or have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations it would have destroyed the economy of California and I must say we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency we still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country as for offshore oil only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil the the rest as to whether the open the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so we're already five years behind in what we should be doing there is more oil now in the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out in 120 years one years that they've been drilled Thank You governor Thank You mr. president the next question goes to governor Reagan from William Hilliard governor Reagan wage earners in this country especially the young are supporting a social security system that continues to affect their income drastically the system is fostering a struggle between the young and the oil and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups how much longer can the young wage-earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the Social Security system the Social Security system was based on a false premise with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase it is actually out of balance and this first became evident about 16 years ago and some of us were voicing warnings then now it is trillions of dollars out of balance and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history the payroll tax increase for Social Security which will only put a bandaid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most what is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force to look of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound but with the premise that no one presently depended on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check we cannot frighten as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that is going on in this campaign our senior citizens leave them thinking that in some way they're endangered and they would have no place to turn they must continue to get those checks and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis but it's going to take some study and some work and not just passing a tax increase to let the load or the roof fall in on the next administration would you repeat that question for President Carter yes President Carter wage earners in this country especially the young are supporting a Social Security system that continues to affect their income drastically the system is fostering a struggle between young and old and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups how much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the Social Security system as long as as a Democratic president in the White House we will have a strong and viable Social Security system free of the threat of bankruptcy although governor Reagan has changed his position lately on four different occasions he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system which would in effect very quickly bankrupt it I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustments in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation these kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security and the well-being and a peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age but no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound it must be kept that way and although there was a serious threat to the Social Security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became president the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis that's a way it will stay and Governor Reagan well that just isn't true it is I said delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax because the problem for the young people today is that they're paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out now again this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune that I was for voluntary Social Security which would mean the ruin of it mr. president the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother and I suggested that if this is an insurance program certainly the person who's paying in should be able to name his own beneficiaries and that's the closest I've ever come do anything voluntary with Social Security I to and pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours they're going to continue to get their money there are some changes I'd like to make I would like to make a change that discriminates in the regulations against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father or her husband's benefits if he dies first or what she is paid in but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself and she is entitled to more and she presently can get I'd like to change that President Carter's rebuttal now right these constant suggestions that the basic Social Security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the agent of our country it's obvious that we should have a commitment to them that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that that would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to the retired people we also need to continue to index the Social Security payments so that if inflation Rises the Social Security payments would rise Documentary degree to let the buying power of the Social Security check continue intact in the past the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits Governor Reagan as a matter of fact began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance with an emphasis on the prevention of disease an emphasis on outpatient care not inpatient care an emphasis on Hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who are ill and emphasis own catastrophic health insurance so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because the very of a very high medical bill then the insurance would help pay for it these are the kind of of a national health insurance important to the American people governor Reagan again typically is against such a proposal governor now you go again when I opposed Medicare there was another piece of legislation meaning the same problem before the Congress I happen to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them I was opposing one piece of legislation as versus another there is something else about Social Security course that doesn't come out of the payroll tax it comes out of the general fund that something should be done about I think it's disgraceful that the disability insurance fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or from mental illness and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs in their care President Carter you have the last word on this question I think there's debate on Social Security Medicare national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party the allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another and the deleterious comments that the governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation these commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address in other words I have never heard a candidate for president who is a Republican quote a Republican president but when they get in office they try to govern like Republicans so it's good for the American people to remember that is a sharp basic historical difference between governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues also between the two parties that we represent Thank You mr. president governor Reagan we now go to another question question to President Carter by Barbara Walters thank you you have addressed some of the major issues tonight but the biggest issue in the minds of American voters is yourselves your ability to lead this country when many voters go into that booth just a week from today they will be voting their gut instinct about you men you've already given us your reasons why people should vote for you now would you please tell us for this your final question why they should not vote for your opponent why his presidency could be harmful to the nation and have been examined both your opponent's record and the man himself tell us his greatest weakness Robert reluctant as i understanding critical about governor Reagan I'll try to answer your question first of all is the historical perspective that I've just described this is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party as exemplified by the actions that have taken in the Oval Office the last four years as contrasted with Governor Reagan who in most cases does typify his Prada but in some cases there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others the most important crucial difference in this election campaign in my judgment is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations that don't presently have it predicted the terrorist Nations the inclination the Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he's been running for presidents I think since 1968 to inject American military forces in places like North Korea to put a blockade around Cuba this year or in some instances to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America this is typical of his long-standing inclination on the use of American power not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it obviously no president wants war and I certainly did not believe the Governor Reagan if he were president would want war but a president in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace through diplomacy or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past Barbara would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan thank you realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent why his presidency could be harmful to the nation and having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself could you tell us his greatest weakness Oh Barbara I believe that there is a fundamental difference and I think it has been evident and most of the answers that mr. Carter's given tonight that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a federal government program I happen to believe that the federal government has usurped powers and autonomy autonomy and authority that belongs back at the state and local level it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people and that there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves if they were given a chance or by the levels of government that were closer to them now as to why I should be and he shouldn't be when he was a candidate in 1976 President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index he added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation and it came at that time to 12.5 under President Ford and he said that no man with that size misery index had a right to seek re-election to the presidency today by his own decision leave misery index is an excess of 20% and I think this must suggest something but when I have quoted a Democrat president as the president says I was a Democrat I said many foolish things back in those days but the president that I quoted had made a promise a Democrat promised and I quoted him because it was never kept and today you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what republicanism represents in this country today and that's why I believe they're going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around because they too want that promise kept it was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people President Carter yes I mentioned the radical departure of governor Reagan from the principles or ideals or historical perspective of his own party I don't think this can be better Illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation for 40 years the Republican Party platforms call for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment six predecessors of mine who served in Oval Office call for this guarantee of women's rights governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered when a man and a woman do the same amount of work a man gets paid a dollar a woman only gets paid 59 cents and the Equal Rights Amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for women by the federal government or by the state government that's all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party and which is a very important commitment of mind as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policies of his own party Governor Reagan yes mr. president once again I happen to be against the amendment because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands of unelected judges I am for equal rights and while you have been in office for four years and not one single state and most of them have a majority of Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment while I was governor more than eight years ago I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations including the economic ones that you have just mentioned equal pay and so forth I believe that if in all these years that we've spent trying to get the amendment that we'd spent as much time correcting these laws as we did in California and we were the first to do it if I were president I would also now take a look at the hundreds of federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment I would have someone ride herd in those regulations and we'd start eliminating those discriminations in the federal government against women president correa yes Howard I'm a southerner and I share the basic beliefs of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system one of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country we've been remarkably successful with the help of the Democratic Congress we deregulated the air industry the rail industry the trucking industry financial institutions now working on the communications industry in addition to that I believe this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps since the long Depression years and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country we've made remarkable success it's part of my consciousness and my commitment to continue this progress so my heritage as a southerner my experience in the Oval Office convinces me that what I've just described is a proper course for the future governor Reagan yours is the last word well my last word is again to say that this we were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights and I make it a plain again I am for women's rights but I would like to call the attention of the people of the fact that that's so-called simple amendment could be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong by law to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes labor laws that protect them against doing things that would be physically harmful to them those would all could all be challenged by men and the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth I thought there was a subject we were supposed to be on but if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth I'm the only fella that ever ran for this job who was six times president of his own Union and still has a lifetime membership in that Union gentlemen each of you now have three minutes for a closing statement President Carter you'll first first of all I'd like to thank illegal League of Women Voters for making this debate possible I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and governor Reagan also I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during this last few hours in my life I've been present now for almost four years I've had to make thousands of decisions and each one of those decisions has been a learning process I've seen the strength of my nation and I've seen the crises that it approached in a tentative way and I've had to deal with those crises as best I could as I've studied the record between myself and governor Reagan I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us I think the result of this debate indicate that that fact is true I consider myself in the mainstream of my party I consider myself in the means mainstream even of the bipartisan list of presidents who served before me the United States must be a nation strong the United States must be a nation secure we must have a society that's just and fair and we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace to create a peaceful world I believe that since I've been in office there have been six or eight areas of combat Evolved in other parts of the world in each case I alone have had to determine the interest of my country and the degree of involvement of my country I've done that with moderation with care with thoughtfulness sometimes consulting experts but I've learned in this last three-and-a-half years that when an issue is extremely difficult when the call is very close the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50/50 and the final judgement about the future of a nation war peace involvement reticence thoughtfulness care consideration concern has to be made by the men in the Oval Office it's a lonely job but with the involvement of the American people in the process with an open government the job is a very gratifying one the American people now facing next Tuesday a lonely decision those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country and I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference if one vote per precinct had changed in 1960 John Kennedy would never have been president of his nation and if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968 Hubert Humphrey would have been press richard nixon would not there is a partnership involved and our nation to stay strong to stay at peace to raise how the banner of human rights to set an example for the rest of the world to let our deep beliefs in commitments be felt by others in all the nations is my plan for the future I ask the American people to join me in this partnership Governor Reagan because I would like to add my words of thanks too to the ladies of the of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate so that he could have been seen also in these debates but still it's good that at least once all three of us were heard by the people of this country next Tuesday is election day next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls who stand there in the polling place and make a decision I think when you make that decision it might be well if you would ask yourself are you better off than you were four years ago is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago is America as respected throughout the world as it was do you feel that our security is as safe that we're as strong as we were four years ago and if you answer all of those questions yes why then I think your choice is very obvious so who you'll vote for if you don't agree if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow over the next four then I could suggest another choice that you have this country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in we do not have to go down go on sharing and scarcity with the country getting worse off with unemployment growing we talk about the unemployment lines if all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each one of them that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles California all of this can be cured and all of it can be solved I have not had the experience that the president has had in holding that office but I think in being governor of California the most populous state in the Union if it were a nation it would be the seventh ranking economic power in the world I too had some lonely moments and decisions to make I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today I know because we did it there we cut the cost the increased cost of government the increase in half over the eight years we returned 5.7 billion dollars in tax rebates credits and cuts to our people we as I said earlier fell below the national average in inflation when we did that and I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people I would like to have a crusade today and I would like to lead that crusade with your help and it would be one to take government off the backs of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well because you did them and made this country great thank you gentlemen ladies and gentlemen for 60 years the League of Women Voters has been committed to citizen education and effective participation of Americans and governmental and political affairs the most critical element of all in that process is an informed citizen who goes to the polls and who votes on behalf of the League of Women Voters now I would like to thank President Carter and governor Reagan

Victor Davis Hanson [Applause] you only have about an hour or so good evening everyone you might know me as John hi Bush I have the honor of being the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute thank you for coming this evening in honor of our men and women who defend our freedom around the world if you'd please stand and join me for the Pledge of Allegiance I pledge allegiance to the flag thank you please be seated well as we get started there's a couple that I'd like to recognize in the audience today you will recognize them one of the best governors of California has ever had Pete Wilson and his wife before we get started with our event this evening some of you like me might have looked around the auditorium and asked yourself the same question I did how is it that of all people a classics professor can fill an auditorium like this this was not an easy ticket to get if you waited more than a few days hundreds of people had to be turned away unfortunately but when one considers that this scholar this honoured fellow this syndicated columnist this award-winning academic this political commentator this presidential appointee and this author of 24 previous books is Victor Davis Hanson well then the question answers itself I don't know if there are any former fortunate students of Professor Hanson here tonight if so all of us envy you most of us gathered here have only gotten to know Victor Davis Hanson not through semesters of academic study and personal interaction rather we have had to settle for the all too brief appearances from afar on Fox News for example or perhaps read his scholarly papers articles editorials book reviews and of course his own books they cover a dramatic range of subjects from the classics to military history to Foreign Affairs domestic politics in contemporary culture now I don't know about you but when I see him on TV I actually lean in I leaned forward it's because I want to really carefully listen to him I know I'm going to see and hear a demonstration of highly refined but practically spoken intellectual horsepower his sweep of knowledge in history distilled as it is into logical arguments that every one of us only wish we could so eloquently make ourselves is the equivalent somewhat of a two-by-four but rather than hitting your liberal neighbor across the fence over the head with it because they insist that our nation can afford the green new deal or a free education for all or a thousand other such ridiculous ideas you need only simply quote professor Hanson to prove they're wrong many personal injury lawsuits have been avoided this way today professor Hanson comes to us what with what I think is his 25th book called the case for Trump I don't often quote from book jackets but here I cannot resist it sums up the book so well you have to get this book that I believe that professor Hanson probably wrote it himself let me quote quote to trump alone had the instincts and energy to pursue an opening to victory dismantle a corrupt old order and bring long overdue policy changes at home and abroad after decades of drift Hansen argues that America needed an outsider like Trump to do what normal politicians would and could not do a fact that explains the furor directed to Trump by the political in media status quo close quote it is a marvelous book written by an extraordinary talent before I introduce our guest this evening I want you to know I did some math on your behalf imagine for a moment we were all students at Stanford or the u.s. Naval Academy or Berkeley or peper 9 where he has taught before now consider that we had the rare opportunity after we all paid our tuition to elbow our way into one of his courses on any given semester at about 12 to 15 weeks per semester two classes per week in tuition bidding what it is a stays divided by to subtract the for the next hour of instruction you receive will cost you somewhere between three to five hundred dollars considering the fact that all of us here tonight are here for free we are getting a real bargain my fellow students class is in session please join me in welcoming our professor Victor Davis [Music] [Music] thank you very much I'm a little worried about the money because you might want to refund as I said to John I I feel like a rescue dog that's been battered the last 10 days and I found a nice home think I'll stay with you but I think in the last 10 days [Music] I think I've been called in print racist sexist nativist and worse things yet but I kind of wonder I feel like that that's not going to happen tonight so it's so strange yeah anyway no I'm sure you're amongst friends professor so thank you so much for coming I had I you know I read a lot of books and this one I so enjoyed because I just have to say if you picked this book up every page reads like one of the best op eds you've you've ever read it is so well put together so thank you and I do think you'll enjoy your time here in the next many minutes professor I I wanted to start by reading three lines from an early page in your book that I hope you recognize I bet you will and ask to see if you might expand on it because it's a perhaps of potentially really frightening concept you say quote without their overwhelming fealty or barring another transformative Reagan candidate neither Trump nor any other contemporary Republican candidate will likely again find a pathway to the presidency yeah explain well at a time that stick the Obama administration the Republican Party at the state and local level picked up about almost 1,100 offices and yet in five out of the six last national elections it lost the popular vote it hasn't won 51 percent of the popular vote since Lee Atwater you remember the Boston Harbor ad the tank add all of that again at least some of us do controlled enough against Mike Dukakis so there was something missing there in the Republican message at the presidential level and I think part of it was that two things very quickly one there became a mindset that we didn't want to be called certain names racist sexist homophobic esporte whatever it was and so we thought by playing by the marcus of Queensbury rules that that magnum entity would be reciprocated in kind when in fact it was considered weakness to be exploited or condemned or pitied and so we didn't really and I'm thinking here of george w bush who was just treated terribly between 2007 and 8 nazi brown shirt and didn't respond and so i think people felt there were two things one way they wanted somebody who would respond they felt that even if Trump was chemotherapy at least he'd kill the cancer before you with the host and the second thing was that the message they felt that you just don't you just don't write off the interior of the United States and say it's de-industrialized or their deplorable so they're cleaners are their wacko Birds or their crazies that these are noble people and that and that and you don't say that China's predetermined to run the world when one American we have one-third that the population of China still have we have roughly three times the GDP and blunt terms one American produces goods and services of the equivalent of three Chinese counterparts and yet we're told all the time China China China you can't do this you can't do this so there were a lot of things that had to be talked about in a way that Trump did and yet that message was a very focused on the key states where the election was going to be decided Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania and I don't know if anybody everybody said Trump was the only candidate that could lose to Hillary I think he was probably the only Republican candidate that could have won and he'll he might have been the only two that they could have lost but [Applause] make America great again I don't know how many had a chance to look at these slides as they rotated before the event began but there were several that were campaign posters and buttons and things from Ronald Reagan's campaign in 1980 you know in which Ronald Reagan said and strongly advertised let's make America great again now knowing that my sense is the what the media is doing is they're viewing whether it's the Hat of a statement or whatever that this is president Trump's way of wanting to take America back to the 1950s pre Civil Rights premi to free women's rights pre all those things and that that's essentially what one ought to read into those four letters or four words is that your view is that the way you think this is playing itself out and is that your view where you think Donald Trump wants to take the country I don't think he wants to take it back to the pre-civil other you're you're confirmed with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez at just that that Ronald Reagan was a racist not very long ago as well as FDR no I think that what he's trying to say let's make America great is in the narrowest sense there's no reason why the United States had should have not achieve annualized GDP of 3% since 2006 and why why can't we have a record low minority unemployment and record P stood near three point seven three point eight we're almost record peacetime unemployment and who says that we that there is such a thing as peak oil and perhaps maybe we can add three million barrels of oil production since he's so there was no artificially imposed politically clear limits and then he looked at a time where he fell that this country when Reagan was governor was about so I don't like to use those term because we're all mixed up in many families they don't really mean it very much unless you're Elizabeth Ward and you have a DNA test but we were about 90 percent so-called white and then maybe twelve ten percent so-called african-american and Latino but in every culture that has a dominant population there's problems there is an Iraq there's a one what was unique about the United States that was baked into our founding that all men are created equal so you had a constant process of self correction and self-criticism and we were evolving into what had happened with the Italian experience where Italians came they were mostly democratic and today if her name is Giuliani or Pelosi you don't know what your why your ethnic cachet you can't tell that was the goal and I think we were working toward that and so when what Trump says that I think he thinks that race or ethnicity should be incidental not essential to your persona but what's happened that almost everything is politicized and ethnic or identity politics term that the immigration has now become a demographic Club to beat the opposition with and that we're supposed to self-identify as as I'm a I'm a Latino I'm gay I'm this I'm that and I understand what it's the everybody has pride in some kind of identification but it should be I'm an American citizen and what's unique about what's really unique about this country is that none of us can go to China and be fully accepted as Chinese you can't go to Mexico and be fully accepted as a Mexican citizen unless you look like the majority population I can tell you as someone who's lived overseas for three years I could never be fully accepted as Greek because I don't look Greek and yet this is a country where we've come so far and that's your appearance your superficial appearance is not as important as your embrace of constitutional shared values and yet the very thing that that we're so good at is what people most criticize us for so I think Trump was trying to say I'm gonna stop all that and I'm gonna try to get back to the melting pot and in a being Trump he wasn't subtle about that yeah so on that very topic of subtlety you know politics is often in the art of language and you know if everyone in this audience when you think Ronald Reagan many many think of this the Great Communicator he boy could he use words right in your book you talk about when President Trump uses words often times you think he's quote clumsily exaggerates you know Trump's being Trump like Reagan was Reagan you know if you could wave a magic wand and all of a sudden Trump could be remarkable communicator and sensitive with his tweets and things like that you know would Trump be Trump I'm trying to determine if this is someone you know yeah sure we'll fix him but I don't know that Trump would be Trump I tend to agree with that and you know everybody who has bet on the opposite point of view saying if he would just stop tweeting if he would just expand his vocabulary beyond a thousand words or people just say there are more adjectives in the English language than awesome tremendous our adverbs like Bigley but I don't think I think you're right I think what Trump is and all of his tweet Twitter wars he's reactive he rarely starts a fight he didn't start with : Kaepernick he didn't even start with his probably most notorious one with John McCain well I thought was a mistake for him to to besmirch John McCain but but McCain had called his supporters crazies and Trump was reacting to that when he was asked about it so he's reactive and he tries to bring more mega tonnage in the reply than the if the attacker and then you're very unwise because most people have a self-image and Trump's actually been in a wrestling match physically so if you want to get into a wrestling match with him you're gonna lose because he doesn't care he's been in it and he doesn't have a sense of I mean everybody has a positive sense of self but it reminds me I said to somebody in New York if you were to rate a B and C D party-list where would the Trump's be and he said F and I thought that was one of the reasons I liked it and there was something have you noticed when that I mentioned this but when Trump went places he had this tight tie and the hair and everything so if he was in Alabama or Bakersfield or Flint Michigan he had the same act Queens accent he was authentically Trump when he'll we went to the south or New England it was you all and Boilermakers and bowling when Obama went in the inner city he sounded like he could drop his G's when John Kerry was running he had camouflage and ducks by the neck and I asked he came to Tulare California and I thought even Trump's gonna have to work cowboy hat no he just stood out he had his suit the long tie and the Queen's accent so people did what no would thought would be possible how could people identify as a populist a Manhattan billionaire with a Queens accent that very little cut he pulled off appearing more authentically pot populist than a real populist like John Casey CH who grew up as he always reminded us as a son of a postman though there are so many paradoxes that we haven't really figured them all out yet with Tom you know I'm not sure I think Trump invented that he certainly is quite used the term fake news and you know I've watched from the very start as he used that expression it was you know well since news he either doesn't like or he thinks just plain not written fairly that's what you know to Trump is fake news but I got the sense that as he started getting more and more successful in convincing people that these news stories are just plain unfair and called it fake news the media took the bait and it feels to me like as much as they dislike Trump there now have squit have pressed editorial into news reporting and they really he's positioned them as the enemy and they've positioned him as the entity the second part of what's surprising to me that almost don't mask the American media yeah would step across the line and show a visceral hatred in news reporting have you seen a precedent for that is no and we can we can say things but there are is data that liberal Shorenstein Center at Harvard said that the first six months of what's been worse was 85% negative coverage Obama was only 40 five and then got much better and Trump's down to 90% these six months bla we've never seen movie stars that compete whether it's Johnny Depp or Robert De Niro or Madonna or Kathy Griffin they have a competition whether they can decapitate him burn him blow him up stab him and then we've never seen the administrative state or the progressive media Nexus the moment he's elected let's sue for the let's sue to abort his presidency in three states by the the voting machines no let's try to persuade the electors not to follow their constitution remember those ads don't vote for him and then almost immediately 60s plus house representatives introduced articles impeachment for each set awarded and then we had the Logan act that's calcified we don't use it you then it was the 25th amendment that he was crazy they had a psychiatrist justify and then we had the Muller the hysteria about collusion with the steel fabricated stuff and then we had the Muller the look September 5th of last year we had anonymous and the New York Times remember said he's actively along with loyal Americans trying to thwart the president I don't know what the McCabe Rosenstein do you guys know it was kind of in palace coup where they were going to you know sort of take a straw poll the cabinet before declaring him crazy and removing an elected president so the answer is no we've never seen that and I think the medium is two really important things about Trump the first is that they just thought he was crude or blunt but he did he could at times display a level of self-deprecation and even humor and empathy that because it was such a contrast with his public image that it was quite effective he went all through the Middle Midwest and I noticed he started saying things that no Republican had ever said he said he'd go to esa' I'm worried about our vets I'm worried about not the farmers our farmers I'm worried about our machinists I'm worried that our our our he got to West Virginia and Hillary Clinton had come in said well I'm sorry but we're gonna have to bankrupt the coal industry you're gonna have five new jobs and he said I love big beautiful coal nobody in his right mind would say big beautiful coal he didn't care for his Polly wanted to display an empathy and he carried that state by almost 70 percent and then finally very quickly they don't understand the Nietzschean concept of survival with Nietzsche said anything doesn't kill me makes me stronger so even independents are looking at him now and I have members of my family that didn't vote for him but they will concede that the age of 72 to get up after four or five hours of sleep and hear your wife defamed your young son your adult children defamed hear that you're a crook a tax cheat the stormy debt all of that and yet get up every morning as if it's a new day and keep fighting there's a begrudging respect my wife reminded me of that I came home two days ago and I said God this guy called me a Nazi and this other guy said I was a racist and I said a guy on the plane wanted me to sign a book he saw me and I sign it then he put it back and hid it under the seat and he said it's like a red mega hat I can't show this and and I I said god I don't know if I can take it and she said oh shut up he or you're writing about a guy you're writing about a guy who takes more in one day than you and your whole life so get with it so in history as you know the country's off sometimes been divided north south its way we've often looked at politics things like that but in your book you go to some lengths to talk about what you call I don't even know if it's your words but they've forgotten interior and it's a true it's a real expose on the coast versus the interior of this nation and that's where the new divide seems to be here's my question on it I get the sense from reading your book that that you feel it's the Trump saw this and from a strategic perspective took advantage of it and followed a plan along those lines in order to win yeah and when I read that I thought you know I don't know I you know just like it's tough for him to put together a sentence yet still run a country I was surprised that at least maybe between the lines it felt like you're implying that Trump was a strategist that he had this in mind and executed against it and I wonder if it was just really his raw instincts or did he really actually pursue a strategy to go here go there and take it I think it was a mixture of both I think that first of all he's considered himself an outsider an outer outer Burrell Queens accent person that was Garry Shandling ever be accepted in the Manhattan elite and he wanted to be and he thought that was unfair that he felt by the basis of merit what his buildings that he deserved more recognition so there was a constant sort of anger at the elite of New York and that made him a little bit more empathetic he was a builder he was not a high tech guy of financier a media mogul in other words he dealt with concrete physical things I'm thereby by extension people who laid cement and tyler's and unions so he he understood he couldn't build a building whistles guys were good and happy and I think that gave him a level of insight about the other America but he also had 16 very gifted rivals far more gifted than two thousand eight or twelve field and he had to distinguish himself and then I think he did notice with an innate cunning that they were sort of emulating the Democratic PlayBook that America had changed then they were going to give an identity politics or I think when JEB said illegal immigration is basically a Zab you know it's an act of love and they were sort of progressive light and he saw an opening that he could Double Down especially when his advisors told him that there was about five to eight million people and I don't know what we would call him John maybe the the Reagan voter the the silent majority the Perot voter the Tea Party they didn't want to come out and vote for Mitt Romney and probably didn't come out if you do the math that didn't mean that he was gonna win these states by a lot but if he were to get them to come out and they would vote 80% then he could flip these states that nobody thought could be flipped by 60 80,000 votes less than a percent in some cases Michigan was call most flip Minnesota Ohio in sure Iowa and Indiana North Carolina Pennsylvania and the message was I guess if I would boil it down is that under globalization anybody's labor physical labor muscularity that could be xeroxed abroad was on the principle you know you're irreplaceable that was sort of crass but then the left or even some people the Republican Party reversed cause and effect they thought because your labor could be Xerox cheaper for machinery or manufacturing therefore you were somehow culpable I think somebody in the National Review Kevin Williams said you got to get in a pickup and just be your own fault it's toxic culture and and they reversed the cause and in fact and is it almost as if losers who took opiates drove away factories when it was just the opposite and so he understood that there was that that area had not been at loss I mean Detroit in 1945 was the fastest growing major city United States by some calibrations at Symphony museums were the finest the United States it had some of the highest per capita wealth Hiroshima was in ruins in by September 1st 1945 if you go to Hiroshima today it looks like Detroit should have been and Detroit looks like it was new and that wasn't because of a war it was because of globalization and changes in policy and government big liberal big government but what I'm getting at is that he understood that the message of the forgotten man had electoral ramifications he also had a lot of people who were in the shadows that that we felt had been kind of losers themselves or eccentrics I mean especially Steve Bannon who might not have been a steady sober and judicious adviser but when they brought him on he really honed that idea of the forgotten man and a nationalist populist tweak we shouldn't be too exaggerated eighty percent of the Trump message deregulation judges pipeline construction GDP tax reform try to appeal moment was purely Republican conservatism it was that tweaking of Bannon and others and then Peter like people Peter people like Peter Thiel I was at a dinner once and he happened to be there and there was a very prominent in America name I won't mention but tore into me for voting I was going to about to vote for Trump and he said would the he's a loser he has no analytics Hillary has the smartest the best and the brightest these are wonky SH these are Millennials and mr. teal turned to me and said no actually Trump has the best analytics in the world said he does he said yes he's concentrating on the only states that mattered we know everybody said how would you know and he said I designed them and so there were people who helped that campaign in various ways that didn't get a lot of credit but deserve a lot of credit Mike Reagan was a transitional transformative president there's no doubt about it just he also noted that Trump picked up on 80% of what's been the Reagan Republican playbook for many years do you think that what's Trump is succeeding in doing is will he be viewed in the future as a transformational president that it's very hard to tell because let's take wrong Reagan at the beginning of 1983 we were still in recession he was trying to break inflation we had been so desperate to break it we we had whip you know whip inflation now buttons and I was farming I remember an 83 I went to the production credit we had a family farm and I thought I was so lucky to get a 13% loan and I bought a used pickup for nineteen and a half percent I thought that was high and then I had sulfur bags that I'd ordered sulfur and I noticed that it said $4.99 $5.99 $6.99 they crossed out the price the inflation was so high that they were marking them up in their inventory so and that was when Reagan was president and then I noticed every time he turned on the TV in 83 - if you remember there was a Hollywood movie about the end of days wagon was gonna cause a nuclear or winner I think they even Carl Sagan was always her hectoring us about Reagan so Trump is that that that position you know and Reagan took a lot of heat and broke the back of inflation restored fiscal sobriety but it took really if you look at November of 1983 and you go back and look at polls the unnamed Democratic candidate was running sort of neck-and-neck and then between Nate November of 1983 in November of 1984 the economy grew at 7% GDP it's absolutely stunning and then it was it wasn't even close so we'll see what one of the problems in writing a book is that the news changes so you have to trust historical instinct and analytics and not get caught up in the 24 hour hour but so I tried to suggest that what the the measures that he's taken I think we're gonna make him a very successful president and he has that Reagan has tendency one of the things I liked about Reagan is that people told him all the time he couldn't do something you can't say tear down that wall you can't call it an evil empire and his attitude well it's evil as an empire why not its people and that's what Trump is you know they Trump you you can't get out of you ran to you you cannot move the embassy to Jerusalem the Council on Foreign Relations will have a fit if you get out of the Paris climate Accord that kind of stuff and he doesn't care and that empowers ya you talk in the book at at some length about this concept via the electronic lynch mob yeah the social media that permeates our society today as relates to that particular phenomenon in this specific case involving this young fellow Nixon and the Covington Catholic school I see that he's maybe there's some real serious attorneys that are going after in the media and a lot of the media you know to redress this knowing what you know in our society do you think that they might possibly succeed or you know it's it's gonna be dismissed and we move on well I was fortunate to grow up with my mother was a second Superior Court judge a woman in California and then I think the second appellate court so I always got lectures about the law and she always would say I wish it were true that cases are decided by the leg of the law but so often the political atmospherics they affect judges they affect everything and there was something about that young kid standing there being hectored by this person who had fabricated almost everything about his life beating this drum and then that electronic lynch mob that made him an especially sympathetic character and so he was overwhelmingly he won the the sympathy of the country but I think what we lacked there is that when we used to watch westerns and when the mob went to the jail to break in and Lynch the the suspect there was always a sheriff with a double-barrel shotgun we didn't have anybody like this in fact I really liked the editor and the publisher of National Review but I almost came pretty close to resigning because we had a big fight not that they were on my side but some people as you know in National Review were part of the lynch mob and I thought that that was just intolerable that without any evidence and I I remarked on it David I did watch six or seven hours of the video on anybody with any cognition could see that what the story was and then when he said that he gave the dates of Vietnam you knew that anybody knew the history the Vietnam War knew that was impossible for him to be a combat veteran you saw the the other things he said and yet there was a deep there's a deep illness in this country and it's mostly from wealthy white liberal people who want a virtue signal their own moral superiority and as they damned white privilege and they did that with Sagna and they always do it the expense of the working-class white person it doesn't have white privilege it's almost like somebody in Malibu can say I'm so sick of the white privilege of that welder and Tulare and therefore by saying that then he gets he gets to have that big fence around his estate and have Hispanic help and he's exempt because he said that and there was all this virtue signaling everybody was damming this sandy man and I was in a board meeting of a philanthropic organization and somebody happened to say this was atrocious and we didn't even know that one of the members had actually tweeted to condemn this kid so it was widespread and conservatives many of the conservative establishment were just as guilty as progressive and I really got upset about that as I did with a juicy Smollett case that was another example that's sort of I mean that was the it wasn't that kind of the ultimate trajectory of identity politics because what you were saying what he was saying to America was I'm going to create the most unlikely impossible illogical scenario in the world and I'm gonna make America believe it because they're so deranged that I can get away with it and so it wasn't just I'm african-american but I'm gonna be African American and gay I'm not just gonna be African American gay I'm gonna be African American and I'm gonna hate Trump I'm not gonna be just African American hate Trump I'm gonna be young and hip Empire I'm not just gonna do all that but I'm gonna be walking at 2 a.m. and I'm not just gonna be walking 2 minute I'm gonna see two white guys who happen to be prowling around liberal Chicago not just two white guys are doing it they're gonna have a maggot hat on they're not just gonna have a mag a hat on two white guys with a mega hat and liberal Chicago are gonna say we're gonna will prowl around because maybe Jesse's small at whom we immediately recognize and yell out as the enemy of empire cuz we always watch Empire and you know bob says to fred let's go out and look for Jesse small at type people tonight and by the way let's take some lynched rope with us and then Jesse's and if that's not enough let's get bleached that that freezes that five degrees and we'll throw it and defy the laws of chemistry it won't freeze in our case and then not only will will do all that will beat him up and we're very big but Jesse's juicy is very small but he's a better fighter and he's going to fight us off why he's got his sandwich in one hand and his cell phone in the other recording the whole thing that's what we were asked to believe and the nation did and so I think that was a really I think historians will look at that point and say that is about the limitations of the identity politics and after that point it becomes a caricature because that wasn't factually impossible to believe in yet we wanted to believe because we wanted to say that Magga Trump supporters did this and there was no possible the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
retical abstract way it was possible and yet we wanted to believe because we were full of such hatred and then when it was and then what was really strange about it was the therapeutic response what made him do it who drove him to this he's obviously disturbed I'm thinking no he just libeled half the country and people were walking around and that was that he contributed to a hatred of a particular person based on their race and yet there's no contrition he's still peddling this fantasy yeah so to that exact point what I wanted to ask you extraordinary description of the of events that took place was that so singularly ridiculous that you think it's the incident could somehow play like a an outsize or just a giant be a giant influence in some respects on the 2020 election yeah I I do I think they're cumulative as well I mean there was the Virginia for to false rape accusation there was a Duke Lacrosse incident there was the Cavanaugh hearing when finally Lindsey Graham had his have you no decency moment as Robert Welch good in the Karthi and then we had the Covington and the juicy smaller I think now people are so vaccinated or to that that they don't believe it anymore whether that's good or bad I don't know but I think that they feel that there's a large number of people in the United States not a majority but a very influential minority that exercises influence and power far beyond their numbers and they control the universities they control entertainment Hollywood professional sports the Foundation's the media and they're not empirical and they feel that they don't just want to marginalize conservatives they want to destroy them and want to destroy what they represent and I I don't think that's exaggeration when Nicasio Cortez said that the country was a little we don't have to be ten percent better than garbage and that FDR was a racist I thought to myself well I understand that United States had racist tendencies as all majority populations do but it was already self-correcting and that was that's the story of the United States trying to become better and I thought to myself so all these people that Ocasio Cortez never even heard of rotted on the beaches of taro or they were blown up in a b-17 or they froze to death of choice and Rosa var and they did it for what for this little person to come here and say to them you have a garbage country I don't think people have to put up with and I don't think that I don't think they have to put up with it and I think the reason that her parents came to this country is they understood something that she didn't that's a really interesting question why would you leave Puerto Rico or why would you leave Somalia and come here if it would if immediately upon arrival you and your children or your ass immediately have grievances against your your new country it doesn't make any sense I know I was named after Victor Hansen it was killed at Okinawa in the 6th Marine Division and I read his letters all the time and I can't believe that he died for a country in which major people call it garbage I just don't think that's what he died for and each of us according to our own station has to speak out and say these people didn't die for that they didn't die in the Civil War they didn't they died for a better America not for some person that knows nothing about and I say that because of her empirically from what she's been saying to subtly level an accusation against an entire dead generation I really I'm getting very angry at this idea we attacked the dead and we apply the standards of the present when most of us in the physical sense alone couldn't couldn't last a day in a covered wagon or we wouldn't have last but one moment at Shiloh and yet all of a sudden these people that's not why they're unhappy it's because of our path that's something deeper and to blame other people or their parents or past generation for their own inability to cope it's just it's cowardly and yet the longer that we let it go on and we don't challenge it then we become culpable ourselves so anyway it's off topic I've one last question and then we'd love to turn it to you in the audience to ask a few questions as well professor I'm not asking you to prognosticate and you know make a specific prediction but do you think that the odds that Trump will win again in 2020 are there are they in his favor would worry how do you see that I think it's about fifty five forty five for a couple of reasons three or four reasons very quickly he's about at 42 to 45 depending on his Twitter week he's about where Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were at the beginning of the third year both of them had worse midterms Clinton lost 52 seats Obama lost 63 seats Obama lost six Senate seats Clinton lost eight Trump lost 39 House seats maybe 40 and he picked up two seats and then Clinton demolished Bob Dole and and Obama won handily over Mitt Romney so history suggests that it's Trump's race to lose that he has that power of incumbency he's getting better I think his speeches are better they're longer but they're still better I think he's sinking better he had so many problems with this revolving door cabinet sees but there's something about this new triage of Pompeo a Secretary of State and Bolton and especially bar at when bar the other day was asked that ambush question about the emergency declaration I think Jeff Sessions a good man but he would have probably equivocate it and who knows what rod Rosenstein would have said but Barr just stood up for him and so you get the impression that they do genuinely believe in the Trump message and that helps him and then he's not running in a vacuum everybody thinks that president's run in a vacuum it's not a it's a mannequin choice between something sometimes good or something better or somebody bad and somebody worse that's what Americans do their practical pragmatist since 2016 probably a quarter of the people who voted for Trump just could not abide by the idea of President Clinton Hillary Clinton this time it depends on do they really want to go the Mondale 84 as I said are 72 but when you put reparations and infanticide is permissible abortion the new Green Deal bowring the a bar in the internal combustion engine Medicare for all I can't even remember all 16 year old voting and felons can vote in Florida wealth tax we've never had an already tax capital 90% rate you put all that basket together and they're gonna try to tar every nominee in that brutal primary to endorse that and so Trump will be we don't know how well they're gonna tar those people but Trump as it looks now will be able to say you may not like me but I'm the only thing standing between you and socialism or worse you know so the idea that Joe Biden who said that George Bush should get on TV the way that FDR did on 1929 when there was neither TV nor FDR was president and you know he said everything from gonna put you back and change so I'm gonna take Trump out buying the the gym and that's the sober and judicious candidate so we'll see but I think he has about a fifty five percent chance barber will depend on usually what ruins and incumbency is a economic downturn or an unpopular war or some sort of scandal I I don't see him doing an optional military large intervention I don't I think the economy will survive a recession and I think the Mueller investigation I could go on all night but I don't think they're gonna find collusion that was its mandate so I think he'll be it'll be up to how well the campaign is run and how well he can tag the opposition is something we've never seen since 1932 question is if you have a question we've have several people in the audience our staff with microphones if we can just wait to ask your question but the microphone in your hand we'll start right here Thank You professor really appreciate it I'm really enjoying also your online world war two course thank you with Hillsdale which is awesome one fun question than one one I've been thinking about lately who would you think from your military history and study kind of tactically Fitz Trump that you might think of as far as instinctual covering ground winning before the wars even fought and then kind of a question I've been thinking about the Bolshevik Revolution where it wasn't too high a percentage of people that were Bolsheviks were actually in control of the message that was out there I kind of relate that with the media today so I was wondering your thoughts on that yeah well just a fun there are people in American history that are very trumpian William Tecumseh Sherman said to the media on the march through Georgia I'm gonna hang all of you if you don't if you write another thing and then he he he would have and he was considered crazy in fact he was relieved to command in 1862 and considered certifiably they called it melancholy in those days Patton if you look at Patton's personal life and because we're in a polite audience I won't mention things that Patton did but they make Trump's look pretty normal and if you did if you had a sober and judicious and very wonderful man like Omar Bradley Patton's immediate superior he was a wonderful man but if he had been commanding Third Army and Patton was not there we would have lost another 40,000 dead Curtis LeMay oh my gosh he said if we lose the war I'll be tried as a war criminal but what he meant was he took a a billion dollar Manhattan Project bigger than the Manhattan Project excuse me the b-29 and he took it from 30,000 feet down to 7,"000 feet and turned it into a veritable dive bomber because the bombs given the jet stream in the altitude and then we're in the engine it was not working it was a big disaster and he took out 120 days 75 percent of the industrial capacity of Japan and he was on the cover of Time magazine and considered a hero and by the early 60s he was dr. strange madman that we all hated that's sort of what Trump is I think he's I said that in the book he's a tragic hero as long as we realize what that term means it means somebody who's got particular skill sets that we bring in whether it's Shane or Gary Cooper in high noon or John Wayne and The Searchers or the Magnificent Seven and they start to solve the problem but as they start to solve the problem they give us the luxury of being hyper critical and critical of the methods they do that we consider our saviors uncouth so I think that as the economy gets better we can we have the luxury now of criticizing Trump I don't think Trump is going to be invited to funerals after as presidents or after he's out I don't think he'll be considered a I think he'll do more for the United States and most of our ex presidents have that are alive and yet he will not be accepted with the same respect that they are and that's just the tragedy of somebody right out of Sophocles or maybe Dirty Harry testin thank you very much I'm really concerned about the lay of the land the federal level state level for voter fraud and I am hoping you can perhaps share some insight on steps maybe that are in the work excuse me in the works or can be planned for to handle voter fraud you all know what happened in Orange County but my congressional representative was a wonderful man David Bal Dail from Portuguese immigrant family and he won the midterm I think about 18% is his internal polls were showing him 12 up on the election week he won I think by five points six points on Election Day he lost by 500 votes so what happened is was same-day registration in the new 19 2017 wall that said a non family member could go to a home register and have the vote and deliver to the register hundreds of thousands of people took data from the DMV and they said these people fit a particular pattern the DMV had said we had mixed people who were here illegally with here non legally with their licenses and he said it was only a few thousand we don't know if that's accurate but nevertheless they were able to be very clever they didn't do it in the midterm so all these Republicans had won the midterms or at least did better than their general election opponent and they let down their guard and then they were overwhelmed with this brilliant but Machiavellian strategy and the short term there's nothing you can do unless you change start changing the laws or revert back what they were or you sue or you both harvest and by that I mean you get your own computer analytics and you say there's this many Republicans are conservative leaning people who didn't register or they're registered and didn't vote and I'm gonna have a guy go to their home I'm gonna sit there until they hand me the ballot that's a poor support remedy for a democracy but I don't know how you're gonna do in the short I'm very worried and I think their theoretical e the California congressional district that so Representatives only seven now out of 52 or 53 I think we could get down to one or two with this vote harvesting and of course if you object to it they've already prepped the battlefield so you're insensitive you're exclusionary you're racist etc etc but it's a that's a very good question there's no answer yet to it over here we're very proud that you're a California resident and as someone who's looking to leave the state because I believe strongly in a two-party system and we don't have that here what do you what recommendations do you have for those of us in California who are living here living in a one-party state what what do you see what hope is there well my only hope is I guess herb Stein said Nixon's economic by anything that can't go on won't go so you have a state now where this was a paradise in the 70s and 80 we had good governance governor here but we have the highest basket I think we're second or maybe we're first with a 13-point to top rate of income tax we're about number three in sales tax our gas tax will be number one most expensive and yet when you look for commiserate advantages many of the ratings of our infrastructure were 47 I think 48 or high school and eighth grade test scores about 45 we have some of the highest skill a second highest kilowatt rates in the United States its third highest overall gasoline's I think we have 21% of the state lives below the poverty line we have one third of all welfare recipients so whatever happened if we had the worst of both worlds it's very expensive for the middle class to live here and you get very little in return and so that can't go on for much longer when I go to Palo Alto and I see that very wealthy people who virtue signaled their liberality and they live these expansive homes in Woodside and beautiful homes an old pal Walter and Atherton then I go back where I live in salmo rural Fresno County and on an August day when it's 109 outside Hispanic families are in Walmart they're not there to buy things they're taking their whole family because they cannot afford to turn on the air-condition and that's even with lifeline rates so it seems to me that there is a potential of a lot of emerging people of a non-traditional middle class and they're starting to ask questions why do I have to pay the highest gasoline why do I have the highest electricity why is the 99 freeway a deathtrap who in the world created this debacle Stonehenge Matt high-speed rail monstrosity over the Fresno why didn't we build the three reservoirs these are not right when people asking those questions and when they get when they start I think they'll start to resemble at some point the rebellions we had with the Reagan Revolution in the 60s and 70s but we're not there yet as to get a little worse I'm afraid before they get angry because but I know a lot of people I have Mexican American people within my family and a lot of people are asking questions that are very embarrassing wires dianne feinstein attacking catholicism why is kamala harris attacking the Knights of Columbus who dreamed up the idea you could kill a baby and call it abortion who who who told us that transgendered restrooms were the most important thing in California so we'll see what happens but I think that that constituency I am not sure won't gradually become a little bit more conservative we have time for two more questions I'm going to go here given your knowledge and and the parallels you've given us today and written in about in your book let's imagine for a minute that Ronald Reagan was alive in here and could actually give President Trump some advice what do you imagine that would be well they hated but we forget now the degree to which they hated Reagan and we forget I was so shocked that when George W Bush came to Hoover and gave a nice speech but I don't think he realized how much they hated him just in 2007 and 8 they called him a Nazi they vote articles about killing him but Reagan they really hated but Reagan had that and I I don't know as much nearly as the people here at the Reagan Library but he had a unique ability to smile and laugh at all and he was when he had a winning character a personality so Trump has elements of that when during the Cavanaugh hearing you remember that moment it's the best moment he's had mr. presidency someone said will cavern you think Cavanaugh drunk drank too much no but I know that if I did I'd be a total disaster can you imagine me with alcohol that's why I never that was kind of off the cuff Reagan and if Trump I think Reagan would tell him I know that I had the establishment finally behind me but you know I was a renegade in 68 and 76 when I tried to get the nomination and they said I was crazy so I I've gone through what you have but you got a role you've got to be a little bit you've got to have some moment your life or you can disarm your critics through calmness or laughter jocular language rather than just go for the jugular every single time and then I think Trump would say yeah it's easy for you to say but now Lee I'll leave it at that yeah last question I'm sorry that will go up here a friend in the balcony professor Hanson a piece of strategic advice if the election was being held right now what would you suggest a president Trump should be his major slogan or message his main slogan other than I saved you all I'd say yourself I would say it's something like America's great again something like that but what he really needs to do is that I think I get frustrated because everybody who doesn't have any responsibilities has all these ideas whose consequences we never suffer they go bad but what I would suggest to him is that the Democratic Party is so front-loaded into identity politics and tribalism that they've lost the white working classes whether they like it or not the percentages are astounding and the number of people who don't have college degrees we know now is larger than the people who do and college is getting a hit even more with this admittance scandal but what I'm getting at is that Trump has done more for minority voters than Democrat then Obama ever did we have record low a black unemployment we have record low Hispanic unemployment abortion has devastated the african-american Jesse Jackson of all people called it genocide no person has been more adamantly against the present abortion practices than Donald Trump Issa and that's been very good for minorities that message he's he's not anti religious he's not anti-semitic he's not anti-catholic and those strains are deeply now embedded within the Democratic Party closing the border and having legal mara Craddock measured and diverse immigration helps entry-level workers it doesn't cut their wages through cash off the books undercutting labor so he's got a lot of winning arguments for the minority and what I'm getting at is that he doesn't need to win 40 percent of the African American vote or 50 percent Latino vote for those people who identify themselves as Latinos or Alfred he just needs 20 percent 15 percent the african-american vote 40 percent and the Democrats their whole calculus is shattered because they've lost such this old working-class Hubert Humphrey worker so that's what I really really like to see in do is go out with spokespeople and go into the inner city he'd be booed but if he just keeps his cool I think that would be it would pay enormous dividends and he's already starting to do that a little bit I hope he can continues that's that's what most fight was a Democratic Party you really want you to stick around if you can to visit with Professor Hansen and get this book it's going to be one of the best books you've read in years [Applause]

I never thought we would see this it's sitting here doing nothing - spinning here hormones already month people have put this in their recycling bins they thought it was gonna be recycled and yet it's just stuck in this logjam what they actually gave you from the UK was a mix of who knows what I'm not supposed to getting this no one wants it there was high hopes for this it's gonna be recycled it was gonna have a new life now because it's been shipped like this it's just landfill father [Music] [Music] we've never consumed so much and a lot of it is plastic we produce 20 times more plastic today than we did 50 years ago I want to find out what happens to it all where does it go and how much of it actually gets recycled what I discovered was a system that pushes the problem off our shores the end result plastic piling up and it isn't going away it all starts here at home like a lot of families we produce our fair share of waste I think we're a bit different when it comes to recycling I think I'm a good recycler but what do you think two-thirds of us admit to being confused about what can and can't be recycled plastic bottles and tins bottles that's recyclable plastic presumably that's what's wrong with that people talk about washing it but I'm just not sure whether you need to do that I just get it finish with it as soon as they're finished with it I just bring it in the bin done this isn't recyclable film but it's plastic so this shouldn't be in that bin did you put it in I do fight I genuinely do find the whole thing very confusing and I'm not convinced that it's actually worth doing so why is it up to me I want to know more so I'm hitching a ride with the guys who collect my own recycling bins there are 450 councils with varying collection schemes and differing rules about what can and can't be recycled if you don't get it right it won't be collected [Music] [Music] you want to see [Music] [Music] [Music] tell me now because [Music] so you're washing your big pots out and you sort your glass baking sins wash out if not smelling all the time the bins are the day's collection ends here my local depo it's then picked up and hauled off to a sorting plant and there's a lot of it in just one year British households throw 22 million tons of waste into the bin EU targets demand that we recycle half of that by 2020 but rates are stagnating it just 44% [Music] I started in this job in January it opened my eyes to recycling we're not going to places like these you see em which can actually go into a lorry it's very very distressing 20 today you think 20 20 day or two but if you thought all of that plastic ended up being recycled then you're in for a big shock all this plastic might get collected but it doesn't mean it'll get another life we know that we used to recycle very little indeed we know that if you take some products you are recycling probably 40 or 50 percent of what what goes into the marketplace but we know on other things that we're actually recycling practically nothing on a global scale the numbers are staggering 78 million tons of plastic packaging get produced every year and then after very often a very short use just 14% of the plastic packaging gets collected for recycling and even less of that just 2% gets recycled at high quality into new packaging then another 14% gets burnt after use another 40% gets landfills and I quite staggering one thirds of all plastic packaging ends up polluting the environment I found it astonishing that around the world only 2% of our plastic packaging gets recycled I wanted to see what happened with my plastic when I was in my kitchen the other day my children even their yogurt pots as we do a lot from time to time those yogurt pots end up in here right absolutely absolutely those yogurt pots end up here along with about 60 thousand tons of other people chocolate pots to it of course we're here by the time my Recycling's landed here it's traveled nearly 200 miles and gone through countless hands it's an industry that employs nearly 20,000 were we take in material from people's bins and we turn it back into resources by the time the waste that's behind you leaves here it's actually quite a valuable commodity explain what the market is like for plastic in the moment the market for plastic is it's fairly volatile but it's fairly strong it's all resources all of this is resources and I don't want to wait a bit we want to turn those into the maximum value for the market we possibly can it turns out that a lot of our plastic doesn't get processed here it's exported overseas and one country has taken more of it than any other China we live in a commercial world it's no different to any other material it will go wherever the market demand is it will go to the highest bidder China has been an important market for the export of plastics from the UK China imports 10 million tons of classic they don't do it just to get plastic at home they do it because they needed to feed the manufacturing process it's a value commodity it's a resource that gets used to produce products it's not a way of disposing a material but as China's appetite for plastic scrap increased the big problem started to develop whole villages grew dedicated to sorting through the world's filthy plastic one man documented what he found I'd like you to carve India Oh trouble I get a gimbal triple IG inevitable like a little bit come in window okay can I try namah namah namah balaji me with you Carol are you sure don't go so don't know you can fit onto my a juicer don't poet gentlemen will you go together like it fit under the adduction come on Elijah to shower me return it to them the largest tuna her handsome up a true leader sure who you will fire you di di don't go high eating for that teacher doing with your shine it was a wake-up call for China who saw this as a big problem they had to deal with their reaction would send shockwaves around the world I'm trying to find out what happens to all our recycling it's a journey that's taken me thousands of miles to the other side of the world Hong Kong is the world's gateway to China it's through this artery that much of the world's plastic scrap passes on its way to be processed on the mainland in July 2017 China rocked the recycling world by announcing it would impose tough restrictions on the import of foreign waste they called it national sword we've become more more conscious of waste we've seen a lot more publicity more and more people know that they want to recycle they get very frustrated when they can but they don't know where it goes this assumption that it will be being reprocessed and made into good things in the UK but frequently it's not because easier and cheaper to put into a container and send it through on to China why not government equally is it's moving the problem away it's still achieving our recycling targets they've been said but it's maybe it's somebody else's expense just trying to sum up to me what our policy of the UK has been regarding China she needs a solution let's put in a container in felixstowe and wave bye-bye but China is saying I'm having for a little while why are we receiving your mixed rubbish so they became normal straight under a program called national sword china's message was brutally clear any dirty contaminated plastic would be flatly rejected the kind of plastic Britain's been sending China for decades we export about 60% of the packaging plastic waste that we collect and of that two-thirds that we export about a third 40% of that goes to China operational national sword had big impact in that it's always half the amount of plastic in China that's the problem that we've now got China who are now saying actually we don't want this low quality stuff anymore so we're going to close our doors and you're going to have to find somewhere else finding somewhere else for the plastic is proving very difficult I've come to meet Tony Wong he's been trading plastic for 20 years and he has a lot of it sitting in this yard in Hong Kong because China won't take it so this is full of varying amounts of plastic it is it's about a value of that over $10,000 but now because stuck in here and that the market changed because of the importing maybe $7,000 20% down so stuff that's been washed in clean and this is good stuff for you nothing wrong with this nothing at all look at this even though spout and I can see you're very passionate about this this is I see the money I see I see the business to me not like sonic oh well it's a cold in here it's very standard kind of items buzz you just need a country that's willing to take it of course yes and that's the problem yes to put home for them to turn back into value this is now the world's bottleneck for plastic scrap tons of it stuck in limbo the big question now where's it all going to go meet the man who's made his fortune in recycling Steve Wong works with Tony to import tens of thousands of tons of plastic through Hong Kong to be processed in China these plastic film bags have come over on the container from the United Kingdom to here to your place [Music] but China's ban means Steve has to ship his plastics somewhere else he's looking to neighboring countries in which to process China's unwanted plastic he's heading to Thailand and I'm going with him [Music] over several days I followed Steve from site to site he's running out of time to find a place which is capable of dealing with the plastic he wants to recycle [Music] where is what is that myself experience to feel about it the big question here is whether Thailand can cope with what China is rejecting [Music] what we saw it one processing plant put all that in doubt here we found recycling from the UK sitting we were told for more than a year then more disturbing biohazard bags being melted down to be turned into anything from children's toys to household appliances and tastes like more decent than this place please quite messy I see water everywhere and although their production right now is see not a broken machine [Music] what struck me was the bags and bags of well non recyclable waste that was some of it was clearly from the UK that was just gonna sit there for however long is that a sign of what can get through the system what can slip through the net I think this is why China stopping pottage on the plastic wrap because exporters they thought they did anything the ban on importing recycled plastics into China can be a great opportunity for the UK it forces the UK to rethink how they deal with their plastics post use it can also go the bad way where we would continue exporting the plastics for abroad where the infrastructure is even worse than in China and where we have to believe it gets recycled because we have collected and sorted and send it there but actually what happens there is it perhaps gets burnt or it gets treated in a way that's negative for the local environment I wanted to know how Britain would cope if we had to deal with our own plastic instead of sending it abroad what's gonna happen when China closes the door it wasn't gonna be good news I've spent months investigating what happens to our recycling of all a plastic we've been sending abroad all these years a staggering 60 percent of exports have been going to one place China problem is they don't want it anymore I've come to one of the biggest plastic processors in Britain to find out why we've been sending so much material abroad and where all this plastic is gonna go now Petey is in the region of 200 pounds a ton that's carbonated drinks and water bottles milk bottles detergent bottles they're about 300 pounds of top why are you exporting it why can't we just deal with it here in the UK restrictions in the UK's capacity historically that hasn't been a growth that matches the recovery of the materials from the waste management authorities and local authorities the capacity doesn't meet the demand we're not a big island we've got small amount of land mass where do we put this material I think it's a failing in the system it's easier to put it in a container and export it rather than spend significant amounts of money putting a processing plant it's well-known that there is a poor auditing system for materials that go overseas to China or Asia particularly it's generally out of sight out of mind I'd rather not know what's happening to it as long as it's not on our back door truth of the matter is is that we will have no idea at all whether this gets a new life actually properly recycled no we don't we don't know whether it's burn buried or just left on the side of the street so we don't have enough processes to deal with all our plastic but there's another reason we've been pushing our waste abroad all these years the packaging recovery note or PRM is a government subsidy designed to encourage recycling let's take a turn of plastic scrap a UK recycler processes that plastic and because of contaminants like labels glues or liquids might only get half a ton of recycled plastic from it they would earn half a subsidy or half a PRN however an exporter can take that ton of plastic scrap contaminates and all and ship it off to be recycled abroad that turn of scrap is counted as fully recycled and the full PRN subsidy is earned but no checks are made as to how much recycled plastic is actually produced and so it encourages export PRN system was designed to subsidize the recycler to help him confidence to invest in more equipment that will recycle more material that will then grow the infrastructure in the UK but unfortunately the system was designed but it was weighted towards the exporter for that whole bale would be eligible for a PRN whereas those as a recycler we're only eligible for what we separate and reprocess the wait for the exporter is much more attractive than that of the recycler so once it goes in this container the whole container gets issued with that evidence no direct whereas if you have to deal with it in the UK it might only be like 40 50 percent if you're looking correct so the incentive is to bug it in a container and send it away still get the credit for it in fact for all of it rather than deal with it here in the UK correct correct we're not getting the full value of that subsidy whereas the exporter is getting the full value by weight it seemed to me that the ban imposed by China could actually be an opportunity for British business Javed Mao ji set up his own plastic processing business in 2014 he tried to do the right thing by recycling here in the UK how would you describe how britain's recycling industry what state do you think it is in it's absolutely terrible I mean the it's a it's a mishmash it doesn't work properly and it's the whole structure of the British recycling sector at the moment seems to be focused on export the wastes don't process it here because there's no incentive to process anything here there's an incentive export when it launched Jabez company Ecotec was doing well but success was short-lived he just couldn't compete with the exporters how does it feel coming back to it that's pretty unpleasant Ashley but I mean I haven't been back here since the company went into administration there's a very very painful process not only financially but also in terms of lost jobs and also in terms of lost capacity for the UK's recycling business so we we as a UK company we would get a PRN on what actually came out the other end so whereas if you were exporting you would get a PRN on the entire value so if you export plastic bottles on the records you've recycled all of them that's correct but not necessarily all of them were recycled that's exactly but it had absolutely no bearing on the figure that was jotted down on the book well I think I think that the reality is is the UK was liking rates are exaggerated by the PRN system so you in a way would say that you you were a victim of that system absolutely yeah and so what is the incentive from the government to get rid of a system which is favorable to our recycling rates well it's it's it's it looks like we were cycling far more than we are [Music] it's a problem what that system does not only does it mean we're over reporting recycle rates we're actually undermining the competitiveness of our own domestic plastic reprocesses we're actually exporting value we could be reprocessing that material here we had better quality material if we were making sure that we were accounting for the reciting properly we would not have this competitive disadvantage for our domestically processes these are being those overseas it is a serious flaw that we don't know well enough what happens to quite a bit of the recycling we export a lot of plastic to be recycled I myself think that we should have a system where we are much more likely to use that at home because you know where it's gone if you export it and it's increasingly difficult to do that the Chinese are increasingly not accepting it you don't always know where it's gone this is where it's gone I was about to discover what happens when the recycling system fails there are thousands of tons of plastic scrap lying in this yard shipped from the UK in containers tons and tons of plastic sitting in a yard on the outskirts of Hong Kong doing nothing to it spinning here for months already I haven't go to the site to look at the material you sent me the photos which of course not like this what were you expecting we're expanding on a bottle and what did you actually get in the end film Richard plastics and even some pavement here no one willing to handle it ok the one winning because labor intensive no one wants it no one wants it it's just landfill fodder it was an extraordinary sight this recycling had been collected and then shipped just like the system encouraged now it had been left to rot how do you feel about the person who shipped this to you then we found bags from Chelmsford Council in Essex and I realized that this plastic had travelled nearly six thousand miles hundreds of tons of plastic recycling from British homes sits in Hong Kong destined for landfill it's a shocking sight and disheartening to think that people have taken the time to sort it thinking they were doing the right thing amongst it all we found household recycling bags from Chelmsford Council in Essex so I went to Chelmsford Council to see what they know about where their recycling goes and what's ultimately done with it a lot of priorities do these are collection system bags we allow about 3.5 per week through the residents which we deliver free of charge once a year we put a lot of trust in the people that take away obviously our material I went to Hong Kong two weeks ago I find a yard like this this arrow is a pack of recycling from the UK unfortunately that comes from Chelmsford Council it was not to the quality that the the receiving end wanted and so it was rejected and the unfortunate fact is that you can never tell where your materials going I think that will be absolutely investigated there's no way we can be happy about that no no from what you've just highlighted something has gone wrong down the road which obviously raises a huge question for us doesn't it really one will be investigated and once we find out the detail behind it we would take steps to take whatever steps are needed to resolve it we don't want the idea that our material is ending up in a landfill site on foreign lands or or in a yard somewhere we want to make sure that material is being recycled as we've explained to our residents then I received a package sent anonymously photographs of plastic packaging from the UK destined for recycling but now it appeared left sitting on a site in Poland it looked like another case in which the system had gone badly wrong I wanted to know more so I headed to Poland and took along an expert on plastic packaging to take a look approaching the East End district of twenty years of being involved in packaged in weeks the last fifteen so bills or plastic it's quite common so this yard is owned by a British plastics exporter the same exporter whose plastic we found in Hong Kong it's a mix of bottles tubs food trays and film all piled up in bales oh this is carrier bags wow these are beyond you say Clank Wow the first thing is its degraded to such a level it's not really viable for recycling it's not really suitable for the safe in it anything that's held stored on a safe for over 12 months has deemed to be aimed disposal and therefore a landfill and that that could be that can be deemed as a train and there could be prosecution types and taken against to me it looks like it's inevitable destinations a landfill so it looks like curbside recycling certainly this carrier bags there that from a local council that's sure that householders going to the effort of putting all their plastic waste into a bag this is Chelmsford Council it's not the first time I've seen a Chelmsford council bag in a place where you wouldn't expect these are mixed waste feels what it means as it's cardboard metals plastic all mixed together and the if they've come from the UK and certainly with some of the containers on here it looks like they're from the UK they shouldn't be exported what is the chance that this was brought here to be recycled because of the high amount of cardboard in it and it's being stored outside there's no chance of this being recycled plastic scrap shipped from the UK can earn a packaging recovery note or PRN that's the evidence note to say something's being recycled but no one checks to see if it's actually being recycled and incredibly it counts as recycled towards our EU target the exporter gets paid no matter what I mean you could say that the whole package recovery note system for exporters is like just like money for nothing license to print money you could say that but the intention of the system was that the money from prm's would go back into increasing infrastructure but it looks like in some cases it's being abused I think the systems got that inherent risk in it when things are transported across countries across boundaries it's very difficult to keep track of them the amount off and I'll call it pure waste that is lying on the ground the films that have degree deeds the carrier bags that are freaking into nothing and it's highly unlikely those were going to be recycled so effectively they've been brought here to cool and told to get disposed off we found more evidence of plastic from Britain ending up overseas and some of it was so badly decayed that landfill was the only option we contacted Chelmsford Council again to tell them we'd seen more of their recycling in Poland after looking into it Chelmsford confirmed that the plastic we'd found in Hong Kong and Poland had gone through companies accredited as re processors and exporters of packaging waste from the Environment Agency they said they remain confident their approach has the least environmental impact of all recycling practices the reason why Britain has been sending so much plastic overseas is that the PRN system actively encouraged it among those who are critical of the scheme is the man who came up with the idea in the first place former Environment Minister John Gummer now Lord eben there are several problems with it first of all I don't think we have sufficient control over where it goes secondly I don't think we have sufficient control over the quality of what is in there in other words you can have mixed up in that material things that are not going to be recycled and the third thing is China is now from the 1st of January not to accept it I think we ought to be recycling it here and in the rest of Europe but the problem is as you well know is the the problem with the PRN or the PRN system is it incentivizes export it does in certain circumstances you are incentivized to export it that's nonsense and shouldn't happen and we should change it in 2015 Defra commissioned a series of independent briefing notes looking at the PRN scheme we've obtained them they raised concerns about the system the briefing notes warmed that competition is insufficient and there's a lack of transparency and that local counsel so little if any benefit from the money raised the system was seen to favor export with low quality waste providing a cheap disposal route for contaminants and worryingly the papers repeated concerns that the PRN scheme doesn't work to encourage investment in the UK reprocessing industry but these briefing notes were never made public and no changes were made to the PRN system in tune Michael Gove was appointed Environment Secretary and walked straight into a crisis a month later China said they'd ban imports at the start of 2018 a committee of MPs wanted to know what the new environment secretary was going to do about it what impact do you think this will have on the UK waste economy will have it's a very good question and something to which I'll be completely honest I want to firstly just go back to November 2 that environmental audit committee where they were talking about the impact of the ban that China is intending to impose on plastic imports and you'll remember you said that you hadn't given it much thought given that British business British processors believed that this is huge do you regret that yes it's a significant issue I haven't given it enough thought but what we're doing now is everything we can in order to ensure that we turn what is a challenge into an opportunity we've been exporting too much waste what we need to do is to make sure that we reduce the amount that we produce and also process more of it at home do you think that we have the capacity now to deal with the plastic that would have otherwise gone to China naturally the fact that China's going to close its doors to a significant amount of that plastic that's an additional challenge on us here in the UK I want to talk about capacity because I want to spend the next minute of this interview just showing you some footage that we filmed in Poland and in hong kong it shows tens of thousands of tons of plastic on yards that has been abandoned what's your view about what you've just seen well it reinforces the case for the reforms that I've already explained that we plan to implement that the PRN scheme at the moment while it has significantly improved recycling rates and recycling rates have grown over the course of the last 20 years it's still not good enough then the government revealed its long awaited 25 year plan for the environment in that plan the government provided no details of any proposed changes to the PRN scheme we're probably deluding ourselves we think we have a system that's better than it is and actually if it isn't a very good system well we should improve it but it must be recognizing that helping the environment does come at a cost the cheap way is let's dump it somewhere else I don't think we're planning quick enough and I think it means investment I think it means government support and I think we need facilities such as these to accept that volume of material we have to look at reprocessing it domestically it's our waste our problem we should be recycling it when I first started this journey I had no idea where our recycling ended up but I found it scattered thousands of miles across the globe abandoned in yards from Eastern Europe to Asia out of sight out of mind what I learned was that until we as a nation take responsibility for what we put in our bins create a system we can trust this problems going to pile up and we can't afford to ignore it [Music]

Lucy Woodall from the nectar mission and piloting her sub is Robert Carmichael let's see if we can raise them on the ship on the air so yeah underwater telephone Kensington Kensington Omega come back [Laughter] I'm gonna pass you off there now to interview Lucy about the importance of [Music] try again try again hello Lucy can you hear me hello Lucy can you hear us I was just asking you about the reasons you're trying to explore the deep [Laughter] [Applause] Thank You Lucy I try and talk to you a little bit later thank you so the scientists have been coming down as I said very delicately trying to take samples of some of the deep puddles that we've seen some of their the fans that are absolutely beautiful certainly and they very delicately take some of those and back up to the surface and up on the surface if we pair up we can see the outline of the mothership above and up there is my colleague Mark Austin mark we're up here we're safe and well amazing I just can't believe that we're seeing you and hearing you like this just I mean just give us a sense of how we feeling right now well it's well apart from being very hot it's just quite extraordinary just before we came on air we saw a white tip shark very near help down there was it to think random oh it was three meters away three meters away from us you never know quite what you're going to see all above us it gets more and more blue down beneath us it's like a murky brown color it looks very very forbidding I have to say and so the deep beneath us we already went down there to about a hundred and seventy five meters but above it looked pleasantly light I can see small fish dancing on this rocky outcrop just above and obviously it's nice to have the company of the principal scientist Lucy Woodall so great to be here mark but tell us a bit about where we are and just off algebra which I suppose is called the mothership it's a it's a supply ship but right now it's anything but a supply ship it's sort of travelling up as first of all a TV Operations Center I don't we can see the guys working in the porter cabin that's on this deck and they've got the controls and they are the reason why those pictures from you are getting to us and then from us being satellited to the viewer so big television operation on this ship also the main reason how the ship is here it's basically a marine research scientific center and I think also we can see now pictures of the scientists hopefully in their in their little laboratory here several little laboratories here where they take samples they analyze these samples and they look at data and they take a lot of the samples back to the UK so this ship anythingg butter supply ship right now Thomas More's with me you've been looking at the pictures they're from down below you've been here as well for three weeks what do you make of what you're seeing absolutely fantastic Anna's saying there there's you seen a white tip reef shark I imagine she will see many many more I was walking through the shallows with black tip reef sharks yesterday coming right up to my legs no harm from them but there are many other sharks down there she's going to have a fantastic ride all right and back to you but rest assured if we lose you I'm well I don't mean lose you like that I mean lose communications with you I'll be here I'll be your backstop as if we haven't heard enough about backstops but let's go back down to Anna 137 meters below Anna yeah don't lose me mama please don't lose me I think Brandis gonna take charge of that thank goodness you're here and the final thing to introduce is the robotic camera down here I hope hear us talk about the ROV the remotely operated vehicle it is controlled at the mothership where Mark is by highly skilled pilots I have to say and there are often lots of images of our submersibles and beyond and is also crucially the backstop of pictures as well because it is tethered to the surface unlike us down here for when our signal drops out from this sub is probably at will at some point it's real very dependent on what the currents are doing down here and the technology of how we are communicating is completely pioneering and very challenging so when you do lose up as Mark said there to expect that marvel I pick up back on the ship and the ROV is not actually perhaps we can give it away that seems there behind us okay so Mike so I can't Thomas it just a thing you can't can't we and well mark showed you algebra so let's just put that shall we in the context of the Indian Ocean the necron mission which is what we are part of is happening in these Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean the least explored yet the most threatened of the world's oceans and we're diving off our debris and idyllic at all 700 miles southwest of the main Seychelles island of maje were actually though closer to Africa some 400 miles away from others there and around 270 miles northwest of Madagascar the visibility here is amazing and the sphere of perspex gives us a 270 degree view you can look above you can look even below where our feet off and you can look left and right as we do all the time you must be very tempted to look around you all the time oh yes there's so many things in fact if you stay in one spot for 10 to 15 minutes you see something you never saw before we can also control the cameras down here as I said we are perched on a rocky outcrop there it is recharging whoa yeah try some lights [Music] there we are we are literally hanging on to the seamount face the wall that builds up to the at all if you imagine this was an old mountain that has gradually sung to leave this enormous Lagoon in the middle of it you can fit there sizably fit Manhattan in New York in the middle of the lagoon above us and that's partly why we have such difficulty with the currents because at certain times of the day all the water floods out and all the water floods in think it's time for a safety check regular safety checks down here the service topside topside Omega our current depth is four for three feet our heading is one Niner zero degrees like core systems are good [Music] a primitive leg out well we have to do that every 15 minutes so that top side as the submersible safety officer is called can regularly keep in touch with where we are and that was very important as we descended wasn't it yeah we do regular communications checks with the surface part of that is a safety at that lose comms with us we have a set procedure we go through and eventually we'll go to the surface if you have a pregame absolutely and normally you'd be mapping the reef wouldn't you as you descend to try and check a transept a video for the scientists above and give them information when they go back to wherever they're going they're from all over the world aren't there the scientists up there and a reminder too that we really don't know what is beneath 'less no one have got what puffed nuts this morning has ever been deeper than where we are and we don't know where what we're going to see where would we're going to shift direction suddenly now what is very important to remember here is that there are a number of zones people used to think that it was just the shallows and then they would think it was the depths and now gradually they're realizing that there are many stages in between the zones are changing so for example you get the scuba zone which is not 230 perhaps 40 if you're very experienced here it would probably be naught to 20 meters because there is no decompression unit here very difficult to get help so most people diving here if they're allowed you have to have very careful permits would only get to 20 meters the first of these zones then where the scuba divers go is called the alte photic zone known as the sunlit zone enough light penetrates this upper layer of water for reef-building calls to thrive it's also the most exposed to the impacts of human activity so the mixed own down which is where we are now is the Misa photic zone 40 meters to about a hundred and fifty meters the middle light zone it's called often regarded as the start of the twilight zone at this level sunlight starts to dwindle corals become flatter and thinner they are more likely to be plankton eaters than use the photosynthesis at the algae inside them and here you begin to see the white tip reef sharks which I mentioned we saw just before we came on air you're more likely to see the potato groupers and I'm liberal it makes mostly some of those as well and you might see that this is perhaps a refuge from some of those dangers that I mentioned next is a new zone that people have found they thought beneath us the life would tail away with his very little light from the surface and it became increasingly difficult to see life beneath us but now confirmed in a previous negative omission in fact there is the rarey photic zone 150 meters down to 300 meters the term that scientists use to describe rare amounts of like rare fo take it our mission on the whole of this week's coverage in deep ocean live is to get to the bottom end of this zone to 300 meters the zone largely unexplored unlikely there are maybe thousands of marine creatures down there that have never really been seen before 300 meters is the maximum that this submarine can dive to we don't want to do that but they are designed and pressure tested with some safety factors in there so it's actually been tested beyond 300 meters okay well let's talk now to our science correspondent Thomas Moore who has dug deeper at a very different Island in Alfonse and understands these zones and the importance of them to science Thomas that perhaps you get the biggest or the greatest biomass up in the shallows but down here you start to see the sort of diversity that might provide all sorts of answers to life on Earth yeah absolutely and I mean it the textbooks would say that the greatest biodiversity the greatest number of fish and marine species would be in the shallows in that sunlit zone but I think the more people do explore the deeper ocean the more their understanding that there is an awful lot of life down there perhaps more life than the reason the shallows in fact and that is the threat that commercial fisheries are now attracted to the mezzo photic layer where you are where you get very rich fish numbers and those could be trawled in future before scientists have really been given a chance to understand what lives down there tens of thousands of marine species still need to be discovered down there and what you're seeing around you is quite exquisite you're seeing sea fans you're seeing sea whips are the forms of soft corals and all around you it's snowing Anna that is marine snow that is coming down from the sunlit layer debris bits of food the other fish have left over and that is gonna fall all the way to the sea bottom but this much of it we snapped up by life below so it is quite an extraordinary scene that you are witness to and if you went even deeper Thomas Trivedi perhaps he even beyond that to the abyss the difficulty for life down there is lack of oxygen very small amounts of oxygen no food as you say the stuff that's coming down will be gobbled up as it as it descends deeper no sunlight almost zero sunlight and of course constant pressure this extreme pressure and low temperatures it's very difficult isn't it for life to exist as we go deeper and deeper into the ocean and I said I lost you slightly there with the communications but I think you're talking about the importance of lights to the ocean and it drives everything on the sunlight zone you've got lots of corals which form these reefs different corals will grow at different rates some can grow at 25 centimeters a year others perhaps just a few millimeters but down where you are although you can still get reef-building corals because there's so little light they tend to change their shape so you'll get the same kind of coral same species of coral but it takes on a much flatter shape and a table coral it's called just to try and maximize the amount of sunlight but the algae inside that turned that light into energy and feed the coral polyps what are you seeing down there Anna what are we seeing down here we're seeing very small fish you'd think perhaps they were more like small marine fish Thomas we're seeing a large number of sea fans some a little bit difficult to see in this image way of presenting to you now but we will move around very shortly we're seeing some with coral a lot of thin lines and they're famous because they can't retract their tentacles if you imagine that coral is a food for large numbers of animals most corals try to whip in their tentacles certainly to get out of the way and parrotfish famously are they bite through coral with a fused front teeth and that is in fact what gives us our beautiful sandy beaches and some of this debris we've had drop down I mean this red submersible is completely covered in that marine snow isn't it so at that is probably washed away from the coral at all and drops down on us has been quite amazing actually there the submersible there it is it's here okay so we've got the Yellow Submarine moving in now and you've got a grabber arm on that haven't you what to use that for to two purposes in this mission we're using it to collect samples for the scientists so they identify certain species that are indicative of the area that we're exploring and we collect the samples in which they process in the lab later the other reason is for self-rescue okay in what way if we were to become entangled we can cut a line or free up another submersible or earlier in the mission we can attach a recovery line to equipment that might found a sequel has that ever happened to you yes not getting entangled but recovering well I'm glad I'm glad to hear that's not gonna happen to you certainly it's absolutely fascinating down here I have to say that when we started this journey the submersible tips down forward like that it's quite amazing so it tips down and then we drop into all it almost a hole of light and you look back and it's as if the surface is a mirror image it's like we should be jumping into it and not the other way around and then what has surprised me is that you descend through balloon it's just you it's the open seas they describe it as the desert of the oceans I was expecting to see fish straight away but is this strange solitary feeling when you're dropping down did you get that still or not every time it is exciting yet once you leave the surface and even if there's waves and that action like you described in the different layers once you're underwater it's smooth and then you're just looking for the bottom and you know as you get closer to that that sea floor that's when all the life stuff starts to come by and check you out yes and certainly we've had the little fish as soon as we landed on what was a sandy bottom we have the little fish dancing around us to the sea and then here because it's such a steep sided underwater mountain what did you do then well we had a lot of downdraft and a lot of updraft so we were kind of finding different areas getting out of out of the current and and we came in here to this rock we found this this neat feature little cave in front of us and we're just kind of hunkered in there and and I actually grabbed onto the rock to try to remain stable yes and that was partly that was partly wasn't it to try and save battery how much battery do you actually have we have quite a bit if we're maneuvering a lot and using a lot of thrusters it could be reduced to two or three hours if we do a lot of time exploring and just kind of drifting with the currents that are there we can stay down for about six hours and if something went wrong darrel ions if something went wrong we have a lot of methods to deal with that the emergency is to come to the surface but if we were to become stuck on the bottom and we have 96 hours of emergency life support four days four days and how would you be rescued somewhere like this 135 metres down well fortunately we have two other tools are on the mission we have ii submersible same def capabilities and another arm on that so they can come investigate the entanglement they can hook up a recovery line they can try to have us the news of whatever we're in we also have two ROV which I believe can go up to 500 meters in it as well as a little grabber arm [Music] and in fact you can see the grabber arm on the front of the ROV certainly that allows it to get into a cage and so the little thing you can see at the bottom front of your screen that is the grabber arm of the the ROV and that gets into the cage that then is raised in the surface to get out of the way see looks like a syllabus of coral stuck to the top of it isn't it now where is that where's the other submersible goal I can't quite see it I don't feel mean how do you see them where are they interesting behind us that's all around see their lights anywhere no there might be just below us a little bit I have to say that we descend separately don't we and then we meet up below us no can't quite see them both no again but it's very difficult sometimes in the gloomy lie to try and meet up isn't it it's quite difficult to to meet up under the water it is in fact today we descended together which makes a little easier stay together but we do have the tracking system on the ship so they have the ability to know what the position of each sub is and how to get us together it's worth pointing out at this point I guess that I am in fact the copilot that's true I can't find the other submarine that's probably our submersible rather which is one of the things I'm supposed to do isn't it if anything happens to you then I would have to take over yeah that's correct if I was to pass out for some reason it's actually very simple to bring the submarine to the surface there's two valves you open up and the air will start to go into our main ballast tanks and you're on the way to the surface and we use the the sub radio don'twe they would you know what you pretend called an underwater tahoe Jennifer yeah and you can talk to the surfaces through water columns it's a hydrophone and the surface officer has that list of emergency procedures to talk with you as well okay and I would say pilot asleep put on is that a nice way to put it seems to be how you'll practice again yeah leave I'm bringing the summary and he fell asleep co-pilot ready to ascend would you mind if it was an emergency you'd once the x-ray x-ray x-ray okay and they would know to do something up there would they yeah they know to freeze all the marine traffic all of those they prepare for the sub to come to the surface and come up quickly what are the elements that you need to keep an eye on when you're talking to the surface safety officer you've got depth pressure temperature all of these things why are they important in life it's important to give a consistent report as you can hear what the columns sometimes they go in and out so having that that study report of what depth are we what direction are we heading and our life-support systems still on and so we do those checks every 15 minutes trying to see where they are can see some light where are they they're below us I think underneath us let's look under our feet maybe they're under us no can't see you when I went to a left yeah they're still on our body below us and the importance of pressure obviously it's it's absolutely critical isn't it if you go a thousand meters it's a hundred times the pressure 300 meters 30 times the pressure so if we accidentally got out of this right now what would happen to us well they're sold as he mentioned the pressure there's so much force on every little you know square centimeter of that hatch in fact if we were to undock the hatch you couldn't even open it every one of us putting your shoulder into it okay well that's amazing isn't it Emily and the other submersible is down believes us now a little bit earlier certainly we had a visitor we were moving up slightly and there was a potato grouper who decided to come and say hello [Music] [Applause] [Music] they're nosy animals why do you think they come and find us you know we're aliens in their environment so they come and they check us out and I think they're just curious when he followed us up for what 200 feets do you think how much is that about 70 meters he decided to rise to the surface more yeah I saw him first down beneath the sudden anything I came up and was exploring and getting right up against the spirit absolutely brilliant now we were talking about pressure temperature and every the need to be you know as you said you could push this up well I do have all these dials behind you because you also have a digital display as well yeah the digital display controls some of the lights but it's mostly for convenience a navigation for the pilot there's a lot of redundancy in the submersible so we do have analog gauges and a valve to be able to shut down any particular part of any of the systems so just from the top the green is the oxygen that's part of our life support and we are bringing pure oxygen into the cabin at the same rate that we catalyze it to keep it at that normal level the black is the new ballast air that we use to distribute to the ballast systems that allows us to control our buoyancy underwater telephone you saw and then down the panel is the electrical and the only way to feel the true temperature and this is getting really wet up here as many is to feel this and then you suddenly feel actually yeah it was quite cool cuz the rest of it feels really hot because it's such an enclosed environment yeah our acrylic sphere that we're in while it's great visibility it's a big insulator right so this this aluminium patch we can feel directly with the water temperature I'm gonna draw yourself actually drips my rainwater doesn't know that condensation is good that means the life-support system is working okay okay well I'll leave it up its do provide and you do constantly dry ourselves off you don't really want waster in here when we're getting in at the surface you're very careful not to let water get in like yeah I can't affect the performance of the scrubber and obviously electronics don't like seawater and each of the submersibles have slightly different scientific tasks to perform don't know easy so what what is yours I mean that moment will knocked on see I'm not sure you can quite see it but we're locked on just beneath that shot by your brother on rakhi service yeah the Omega has been set up for this mission as what we're calling the sampling stuff so we with the arm we're collecting samples at the direction of the scientists we also have water collection system to sample water different depths as well as the CTD which is monitoring the conductivity temperature and depth throughout our dive and then the camera with the feed that you're seeing that's our HD camera that allows us to actually film certain specimens in detail and I'm in the red sub here we've got Lucy and Robert in the yellow sub the different jobs as USA if we put our lights on even more committee that we let out her and everything and then you can spot us and is that helpful when you get even deeper and an even darker yeah you know we navigate with the lights off a lot of the time because of the deep blues it's easier to see distance but once we get close to something we'll put on a lot of light and that brings the color back into what we're seeing it makes it easier to identify the species and different things that were looking at fantastic well and all of those elements as we mentioned earlier are taken up to the surface where there are all sorts of scientists at work right now Mark Austin is there and thank you very much Anna we take so much of this for granted don't we communications and on loud with GPS and satellites but of course all of that doesn't really work underwater so it's worth explaining perhaps how we are how we are doing this and it is that we've got the two subs below us now at 120 hundred and thirty meters below the ship and at that level you know salt and pressure and the lack of electromagnetic waves means that that the traditional TV signal does not get through so a receiver has been lowered to between the subs and a where we are in fact so the subs then use LED lights LED lights are transmitting the beams up to the receiver audio and visual signals and then it's transferred by cable to the ship where we are and from here our satellite be a normal traditional television communication means satellite gets the picture to you well I'm joined by Oliver steed who's the head of the mission thanks very much for joining us I mean this seeing pictures like this live pictures like this has been a bit of a mission of yours and a dream of yours it has it's been a true you and I think that's because there's two stories in the world about the ocean one is a negative one and we know what's happening to our ocean we're sleepwalking into a disaster at the moment and there's the other side which is just how wonderful our ocean is you know this is the blue planet and the beating heart of our planet is our ocean and we need people to fall in love with it we need to inspire people and it and I hope pictures like this can do that because if we can do that if people can fall in love with the ocean there's a hope that want to look after it and if they would look after a baby the politicians will be given a mandate to act and act a lot faster than they need then they are at the moment yeah look we could have done this anyway why Aldabra i mean obviously it's a very special place but why out there and why why now so algebra is the Galapagus of the Indian Ocean but there's first there's been no research believe 30 meters here so we need to understand how the ocean is changing particularly Indian Ocean which is the least explored and one of the most one of the most unprotected oceans on the planet so what we're here to do is to try and gather that action that actionable data undertake a series of first descents and use that data to help inform the Seychelles government particularly about their commitment to protect 30% of the ocean by 2020 that's an area about twice the size of the entire UK yeah I mean it's protected Haven in many ways but you've been here we may be seeing the signs of damage from climate change of pollution we are yes we Don on the actual island itself and our divers will see tomorrow as well plastic was washing out there we're also experiencing an El Nino in these parts as well the warming ocean the antigenic heat that we produced is now going into the ocean warming it out the impact on the coral so supportin times try to establish a baseline and those stems to see how that ocean changing how that's going to affect the lives and livelihoods of turnoff billion people deliver the nation's around the Indian Ocean thanks very much indeed and it just extraordinary getting this television signal from Dowell and where Anna is an anime even have a spot of news for you down there [Music] I can't tell whether you finished I do apologize it's quite muddy sound down here now we promised you a news bulletin from the deep from 135 meters down here we go then and there is no um apologizing for this no escaping bricks if news even down here our top stories here on Sky News and Theresa May will hold more talks with DUP MPs and her own backbenchers as she tries to gather support for her brexit deal the government has said there will be no vote in the House of Commons if it looks likely to lose to New Zealand now and the cabinet has backed gun war changes in principle after the Christchurch shootings it follows the deaths of 50 people at two mosques on Friday and there are calls for addiction to social media to be classed as a disease a new report by LPS wants more regulation to protect children from firms which they say are operating in an online Wild West well that is your news from the deep I'm pretty sure that no one has done that before so there you go another world first I think we did another safety check don't wait topside topside Omega Omega reporting deaf four four four feet heading 1 9 0 degrees stationery life support is good [Music] [Music] good copy well don't forget if you want to get involved in this and they people really want you to because in showing the oceans like this with the remote operating vehicle air coming both of these submersibles they really want people to see what the ocean is like do get in touch using hashtag a deep ocean life and as well as being on Sky News and on Sky Atlantic we're also on YouTube as well so fantastic way of getting involved also reminder too that on Wednesday we will be doing a question and answer session from the deep if you have any questions please do tweet us hashtag deep ocean live and if you've done anything to pass on plastic hashed I pass on plastic is the way to let us know about that now can we talk to the yellow sub let's try hello Robert and Lucy can you hear us [Music] oh by the underwater telephone right let's try that Kensington

ngton Omega copied at four six nine on our starboard side [Music] hello Lucy this is such an exciting mission for you isn't it to be the first team ever to go deep off Aldabra atoll it must be an amazing feeling for all of you [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] what have you seen so far to make you excited about the deep what have you seen so far down here to make you excited that this is a healthy environment for marine animals [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] Wow [Applause] [Applause] is that because they are plankton feeders rather than leading the light from photosynthesis from algae that live amongst them and if there was one creature that you would really like to see down here for yourself Lucy what might it be [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lucy thank you so much for the moment thank you well we've certainly been looking out for that barnacle there we go we'll turn that down so we can hear ourselves let's just remind you of the journey down here to 135 meters as I said this submersible tips forward doesn't it tips right forward you start entering the ocean and you drop down through almost a circle of light as you come down dropping down through the blue of the ocean brighter blue even debt down here certainly until you get to the bottom and you're met with perhaps some fish if you're lucky if not and certainly earlier we were met with a dancing array of small fish extraordinary journey down as a novice like me but I know you're probably a little bit more used to it every dive is exciting though around here it's a place I've never gone before the life is different and so it's always mean I think we're gonna move soon I'm just gonna remind people that the technology is extremely difficult we're trying to transmit pictures and sound using light beams through water it's extremely difficult so shall we it'll take a bit of time I'm gonna let you just get ready to do that it's gonna take a couple of minutes for us to get ready to go all right just turn a couple systems back first one being the air conditioner so we can see Kensington Omega [Applause] just confirming you're clear we're gonna maneuver out of this location [Applause] [Applause] yeah coffee right behind us four five six [Applause] [Applause] negative unlights to stay just don't come behind us [Applause] so just as you know that the postman the grabber arm turn out did you can see any of the deadly femoral papers in there holding us to the moche surface will be harder particularly [Applause] [Music] to make sure [Applause] where's your song [Music] beautiful water [Music] I look up I can see the top of the rock the outcome [Applause] [Music] get out the smoke me out Bob and you see probably the driver [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're just moving [Music] the best way to describe it [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] look at this here Shailja beautiful you see for my papers no they've been taking [Music] [Music] alone 200 meters so it's very strictly controlled the samples that the scientists Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] which is fantastic desires [Music] yeah one of the things they've been asking us to do for eclectic and filming when it insisted because the ones [Applause] and Thomas this is such an exciting moment or always to be moving around in the submersible [Music] [Music] I'm Thomas I know everyone on deck is that's what the losers creatures that we see down here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we seem to describe difficulties [Applause] [Music] is behind us [Music] see underwater mountain Wars and explain to the surface the small [Music] [Applause] Regine communication shall we with Thomas More on the surface Thomas I have to say we can privileged to see a number of shots on our Burien side [Applause] on the mothership you're very lucky to have seen that shark it's impossible to tell from this distance what it was but I can tell you that there are an awful lot down there with you it's a sign of a healthy reef sharks are what are known as apex predators are not the only ones down there there are groupers too that are big consumers of smaller fish on the reef why are the same many well because this is at the middle of a really strictly enforced marine protected area what you're seeing there is evidence that it works that these fish are given a chance to grow to an enormous size that there are plenty that there is plenty of food for them to eat and that's why the epic striated Predators will thrive it is a lesson to other areas of the world that marine protection can lead to quite extraordinary marine life and that's the benefit for them and indeed for us as we watch these pictures Thomas they're said to be about 19 species of shark [Music] especially [Music] species [Music] to [Music] [Applause] [Music] and is now beneath us once again as we just we can see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] never just to remind you this we have a team who've been the deepest ever in this part of the world that if you are a scuba diver and go to 30 meters around here perhaps only 20 meters because it is so [Music] yeah [Applause] I'm 35 [Music] there's a lot of caves here and a lot of places [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and sponges it's a bit like corals as well they are animals and certainly looks like [Music] [Applause] 500 million years ago today [Music] our sponge [Music] this mission very confident [Music] see to check image [Music] we move along [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well there are wardens who are based on algebra over there one of them who is now joined the nekton mission [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there's a bit about those waters that we're looking at right now she is from the Seychelles and she was actually the first Seychellois to take a dive like Ana botting has now taken what do you make of what you're seeing just unbelievable because for someone who's been here for two years you will never actually imagine that this place is like deep down there is like so beautiful so much environment that you didn't expect it to be like back down there in the deep ocean is like so beautiful so amazing yeah it's unbelievable how many yeah and how I mean you went down the other day what was it like being the first person from the Seychelles to descend to the depths like this it was just amazing the feeling was it was mixed feelings it was just for the first time to ever be able to go down from like a scuba lower than that the scuba ft was like just breathtaking beautiful and it's just incredible to see such things it was so calm so like you see fish is like just amazing yeah now you spent two years on Aldabra very briefly just sum up what that island means to you just very quickly someone in came a home for two years it became a place that every day you woke up you wake you see the same place but it just it was something always do something new you always experience a new thing every day was not it was the same they are the new day yes but there was always something new happen if there was always that you go diving you always see something different even if you are going the same spot but yeah it's just been a lovely place place that is close to my heart all right well Stephanie thanks very much you've just got a few minutes left of this extraordinary hour so let's go back down to Ana somewhere down in the deep mark thanks very much indeed down in the deep but looking up actually and a shark that is still been circling I don't know if the ROV can see those pictures it's quite murky for us to see we can't identify what type it is but fantastic to see the shark above us investigating and if we look above our head there all these tiny fish that are just watching us from above it's absolutely wonderful to and in front of us of course the Yellow Submarine with the Robert and with Lucy who are still investigating all the nooks and the crannies as we have been wonderful to try and hear inside after all the creatures that might be living there who knows some of them may never have been seen and already we know that carl's are used in cancer care like prostaglandin and so there's still so much to investigate that may be used for Humanity that's why they need to be investigated that's why the scientists reelecting mission are on this ship trying to look more deeply at what is under what is in the deep ocean and what they can see I'm going to show you the yellow submarine again there it is the lights against the wall you can see how steep it is that it rises from the deep that the thermal currents that will farmer pliers that whip around these areas that's the difference is there between temperature in the ocean layer of the different layers [Music] we're floatin you don't even need the thrusters on the currents are good we're just about stuttering thank you so much for watching us here thank you so much to Randy for taking us through in your world it's an extraordinary place to be I have to say that's pretty much all we have time for tomorrow hopefully mark will be down perhaps going deeper will assess perhaps the plastics that we see here and also on the island of Aldabra plenty more from us down in the deep on deep ocean live thanks for watching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes welcome to the Indian Ocean where we have just stopped where we witnessed a broadcasting first because about a couple hundred metres below me has been my colleague Anna bossing for the last hour I hope you've been watching our the first ever live television broadcast from under the ocean and those are the pictures that we've been looking at this is a live picture now and we've been looking at some wonderful pictures and I hope that Anna body now aware that she's got to come up because they've been down for some time now but I hope that Anna can hear me because I want to ask her and be the first to ask her what that experience was like Anna I hope you can hear me still well it is entirely about broadly mark that's the only way I can describe it we just turned our air conditioning off so you can hear it better so we'll start to probably fill back in here quite quickly and in fact this starts dripping rain on us as such as the condensation in this small perspex fear that we're in it is entirely otherworldly if I just changed my camera you can see what it looks like that is the other sub as submersible the yellow submersible with the principal scientist in it Lucy would rule and the pilot Robert Carmichael we've also been down here a little bit deeper epic now aren't we 488 488 feet down such about 140 Connor was sinking slightly in moments we can get a little bit Neeraj of the the yellow submersible as we see and we can see them in there perhaps they can wave to us no they're looking because we have just identified some cold that we've not seen certainly down here there Lucy's looking around just wonderful but it really is otherworldly that's the only way to describe it first of all we've had a shark circling around us for most of the program when you look up it's a beautiful blue color but when you look below it is a murky it's not blue it's not deep blue as I was expecting it to be but certainly here because the legality of Aldabra flushes out there is a lot of sediment that falls or perhaps that's why you get a sense of it being a brown and other world is we can't show what it looks like down that's partly because we're right by this rock face I have to say it doesn't give us quite so much maneuverability and this really shows the geography of this call at all right in the middle of the Indian Ocean it is previous mountain is called a seam up now what would have happened is that the mountain itself would have begun to fall on descend and to drop leaving behind the coal that it made its home and certainly what they were expecting to see here is coral at different levels of depth and previous uncleanness ice ages were then a flooded post ice ages would have flooded and the sea levels would have risen and we're a little bit further out I think that the mirror is currently flat now yes so we're seeing the old world mountains to the ancient the ancient mountain side here and the colors that have made this place their home the small fish - are you surprised grandi by how many fish you see at a depth like this you know not I'm not super surprised what what intrigues me is that a lot of these you expect to see in a shallow reef then we go deeper and they're down here it's amazing what life is where we've never been and done and these are extraordinary aren't they look at these beautiful the light of our camera picking out just beautiful yellow and presuming it's a Karl I don't know we've seen sponges as well haven't we and what is important to remember is that these are living animals and need to look like the other like their clothes these are living creatures that are probably on this rock face in order to catch the plankton and is swirling around the ocean and is brought up from the as we move along with different colors and the from the the white light of the beach almost that has come down as Marine snow absolutely beautiful see these things that we've never seen before [Music] [Music] and just above us all the fish the different sized fish that come to see us and swimming in front the swimming above [Music] what we're going to do now isn't gonna have to start ascending we've nearly got to the end of our battery life have who do you think we need the power to take us to the surface what will happen is that you will eventually lose communications with us I don't know if the remote camera can see the lights above us I can't quite see it now that is a depressor connected to the ship and we are being a light to that and that's how we are managing to communicators have to come really quite close to us today to try and see if we could get communication with the other submersible that will have to be pulled out of the way and as soon as that is Darwin then you will lose communications with us but the remotely operated vehicle over there the remote camera which has been piloted from the ship's surface well hopefully follow us are all the way to the surface we currently that is 478 137 meters so you are hopefully follow us up as far as you can from a hundred and thirty seven meters down all the way to the surface and we'll see you then part two leave a mark see you shortly [Laughter] [Music] we'll hopefully see before this hour is out back on the surface I mean it has been quite a spectacle being able to see Anna so clearly Thomas for our science correspondent here see her so clearly and here I'm not quite so clearly but at least we did we did here what did you I mean did you think that would be what we saw I mean did you think we could do it first of all it was a challenge definitely I think the currents around here have been extremely unpredictable as they are around many of these enormous underwater mountains around a hundred thousand of those dotted around the world but only a few dozen have been explored and we are the first to explore the seamount here in algebra but they do whisk these currents around because all that deep water is pushed up the side of the mountain it can cause an unpredictable current and also cause there was this enormous Lagoon in the center of here big enough to swallow up Manhattan you're quite comfortably all that water nearly all of that water will come out at low time spread around the island that too makes the extremely challenging intensity yeah I should just explain to viewers where we are we're on a a supply ship and offshore supply ship and we're just about what four or five hundred meters off the off the island it's actually on this side you can see it and tantalising because not many people can go there you did you manage to stay the night there with the local Rangers who are working on the island just a few of them but he said it's a it's a an island that's been protected from man by man hasn't it yeah absolutely emphatic so station run by Seychelles Islands foundation they have a team there who safeguard the wildlife there it is something which is where nature is is in charge not not humans although sadly you do see the effect of humans here in terms of climate change so you will see some bleaching of the coral here when the coral spits out the algae that it has inside which it depends on for energy but what's remarkable and this is what I found yesterday there is some research on the island which shows that the coral here recovers much more quickly from these episodes and rather than dying which were happening sadly elsewhere in the Seychelles it seems to be much more robust and that if they think he is possibly because we are surrounded by this marine protected area there is no commercial fishing so there are plenty of herbivorous fish chomping away at the algae that would otherwise swallow up the reef that is crucial for what we see here in terms of fish life and the cold absolutely and what we can't see from pictures that is Aldabra but beyond that sort of reef there's because it's the second largest coral reef coral atoll in the world beyond that is this massive Lagoon what 16 miles by 5 miles or something which is the very central life of that at all and the water rushes through the inlet on the toll free with it all sorts of wonderful marine life yeah that's right an awful lot of sediment and sediment equals nutrients and where you've got nutrients you will find an awful lot of life starting from the very small and of course attracting the very big and this area does have a phenomenal number of apex predators these are animals which are the top of the food chain so thinking of sharks you think your groupers and they're much larger than they would be elsewhere and in much greater numbers just because the waters here are so rich let's just explain what we're seeing I mean these are pictures taken now from our remotely operated camera being operated from just across the ship across the deck here and we are watching the submarine submersibles ascending coming back and and surely hopefully they will be back on the surface and Anna will be back with us but that that camera you can see just the front of it that camera is is what we're relying on at the moment for these pictures yes indeed now that is the the claw that remote operated submersible users of course to take submersibles and so on they were seen in the foreground there but that is one of these submersibles rising to the surface they do like to take their time they don't like to rush it they couldn't in an emergency come up in in ten meters from great depth to ten minutes rather but they do for the comfort of everybody on board like to come up a little more slowly yeah now had we time during the previous out we were going to talk a little bit about what you've seen over the last well three weeks you've been on this boat just tell us a little about a little bit about what you've seen I in hammerhead sharks yes Andres I had all thumps which was the first island group that I visited and I went down in one of the submersibles two to 200 meters and yes I did see an awful lot of life there I saw corals of course but also a hammerhead shark and I barely had time to get my my camera out before this hammerhead was right on me is something that I've always wanted to see this extraordinary sharks with that great classic shape of the hammer at the front and it's got eyes on the end and it also seems to have methods of detecting the Rays buried in the sand there in his head too and it gives it the almost stereoscopic ability to pinpoint the Ray and snaffle a while it's there they're very clever they can apparently detect the heartbeat fish hiding in the sand yeah I see the right and then sharks do have this disability with their with the lateral lines and also sensors in their in their heads do that they're able to almost have that sixth sense they've got very good vision good hearing to the spell of course as we know and also this ability google raise useful eagle rays - beautiful beautiful creatures a metre and a half across and of course it's their their fins which have become extended and developed into wings almost and they they fly almost like birds information under the water and they - and attract other fish to them hoping to pick off the scraps as they feed on some fish now I've never seen a sunfish yeah pretty big from a picture size yeah savvy I wasn't the one to see this you'll be talking to the scientists shortly who did for the sunfish who did see that was blown away because it is so rare to see these things particularly under the water you do see them popping around on the surface with their very high dorsal fins they're sometimes mistaken for sharks but it was quite an amazing thing just just to be swimming very slowly past the submersible really entering there well and before we just came out here everybody was talking about the coelacanth I went to a laboratory in Oxford where they were talking about the coelacanth which was a well as a living fossil of a fish tell us about the silica so the coelacanth was thought to be extinct they thought it died out sixty-eight million years ago but last century a few hundred miles to the South here down the South Africa the Mozambique Channel fishermen pulled up a coelacanth in its in its net and they immediately thought that this was a hoax that it could not possibly be true and yet we have Dino fish that living fossil now possibly in these waters the kind of environment we have here in algebra is very like the environment where we have now seen living examples of the coelacanth this is such a strange fish it is the only one to have a three lobes tail it is the only one to have the beginnings of legs terrestrial animal legs in its fins and the beginnings perhaps of lungs - it's such an unusual fish we don't really understand where it lives we don't understand where it fits in to the family tree of life but it's there I mean is there a chance of them finding new species do you think most of on this trip almost undoubtedly mark the more you explore the deep the more you find is probable that there are tens of thousands of marine species yet to be discovered these are unexplored waters and as you go deeper you will find more you'll find corals you'll find fish your fee you'll find other species too and really just the work doing here on the nekton ship is beginning to catalogue that life for the Seychelles government you and just there finally on this now you may put a baited camera down a common thing to do it's a great great way of seeing marine life undisturbed by humans safer if a submersible or indeed with scuba diver goes down there with a camera you're of course going to get the interaction between that human being and whatever they're saying but if you put a baited camera down there you are drawing in marine life they build they smell they're the churned fish guts in the in there in the bait and it will come in and you can capture that on camera we've seen sharks we've seen groupers it is quite an extraordinary sight yeah and the pictures we're seeing now from under but in the depth are as I was saying from the remote control it looks as though the submarines oh no that one of the submarines is still there submersibles is soon you can just see how steep that wall is mark that's the the underwater mountain we've been talking about that rises four or five thousand meters from the floor of the Indian Ocean extremely steeply and we don't really know what's going on under the water because the last time this was plumbed with with lead weights and rope was 1800s and really we're only now beginning to understand as we put out survey ships with proper sonar equipment look you'll get a much better idea of the shape of the seafloor around here and algebra yeah okay wonderful pictures there and thanks Thomas for the time being and there's the mothership waiting now for the return welcome an apostle really wishing for the turn return of the submersible that brought you those wonderful pictures for the for the last hour and what you can see there is very interesting this is the depressor Nick always a receiver really and this is the bit of equipment that got you those pictures this is the bit of equipment that the the LED lights from the submersibles has to hit so that the receiver or depressor they call it can then relay the pictures by cable to this ship where we are and that is good news because that means that's the safe return of the of the receiver and that means we can use it again tomorrow for deep ocean live and with me now is Rihanna Walton who is one of the scientists on on this trip Ravana thanks very much for joining us I should ask you first I suppose would it be made of the past hour or so watching this have you seen it all before well I mean I've never seen up Deborah that deep so it's been incredible I know a diver I know the shallow reefs I know down to 30 meters but I've never seen anything that deep here so it's been incredible experience to witness it you know live on TV seeing them descending and seeing the changes in the reef is it gets much deeper so let's be clear it's a first broadcasting from that death but scientists won't have been at that depth in this area exactly so that because they asked on its own remote it's so far from anywhere it's very difficult to do any research here particularly underwater so this really this hole at all is relatively unexplored it's only the shallow reefs that we've began to understand in recent years but even much deeper we still don't know much about it and coral is your area of expertise you mean in the Seychelles for sometimes I know what is your view about the state of the coral at the moment so the state of the coral out Deborah is it's much better than it is in other areas of Seychelles so unfortunately we suffered a global bleaching event in 2016 and the the reefs in Seychelles working quite hard in Ireland suffered a large high mortality in of coral but how Deborah did much more resilient so the corals here to show they're recovering already and they weren't and they didn't suffer a high percentage of mortality like other areas in Seychelles right and do you think what we find or what you guys fine here will be a positive story because there are so many stories of coral being impacted around the world how do you think it'll be a positive story I hope that it will yeah of course I think we've already seen positive stories around ever in the past and I think it it kindly be a positive thing that were actually you going to explore and understand the deep air is about ever now and that's always good for research and the question I asked Thomas little earlier why here why what is so special about this ecosystem so our demo is very special because it is so remote it's suffered far less time to purge any impacts that anywhere else in this region so there is fewer effects of pollution of human involvement so for that reason it's remained a lot more resilient it also has a thriving terrestrial ecosystem which also has which researchers found that both of those ecosystems together thrive a better underwater coral reef system as well okay and just finally just explain to us so you will go down you'll get some of the coral and what will you do with those samples how will it help you understand what is happening here yeah so in the shallows were collecting some samples of soft corals and hard corals and also even down to the depths we've collected samples of soft corals and that has to get a bit of a catalogue of the diversity so we're looking for those common species so we can understanding of the the composition of species prompt sort of five meters all the way down to 200 botting very close up in her submersible looking very happy and why not because that is a wonderful wonderful experience that she has just gone through and let's have a look ready very well acquainted with is my pilot for this mission Randy holt thank you so much for having us what an extraordinary working environment you have it's amazing down here you know every dive is different and we get to go places where people have never been before explain where we are going to change the cameras which I can do we've tucked herself into a crevice isn't 135 meters yeah we're kind of leaning against the edge of a cliff an underwater cliff we were fighting some down drafts and some up drafts and we got to this position so we just kind of parked ourselves on a Ledge and are trying to stay stationary and I should give you a proper title of course you are an Aquanaut if an astronaut explores space you explore the deep yes you know where an inner space it's a whole new place down here and you know it's a 3d environment so we're always moving around we're gonna know where we are how how we're moving through the water column are we lighter are we duck the heavier all that that's exactly it's it's it's amazing to watch should with all the controls and as you said you're flying these submersibles you're not driving them and as you said the oceans make up 97% of the habitable space on planet Earth which gives you both a sense of the depth of the oceans but also that 3d environment that we have joined an expedition led by the scientist of the natural mission their aim is to perform a deep ocean health check - map - chart to sample to see perhaps what no one has ever seen before and even search for those rarely seen species literally in the shadows the dream perhaps of a sixgill shark or even a Celia camp the Dino fish thought to be extinct for millions of years and crucially to see what is happening to that often colourful coral as it faces unprecedented threats it is so important as habitat and home to millions of species the big question for the scientists is could the deeper ocean be a refuge from the dangers of climate change and even from a plastic pollution that we have talked so much about at sky well we are not alone down here this is someone the red one although it's been showered by this downdraft of sediment which you will hear the team refer to you as Omega out there we can see them is sub to the yellow the yellow ah yes the yellow one well we have the red what I've already done at which they called Kensington should we see if we can raise them actually because in there is the principal scientist on this amazing expedition dr. Lucy Woodall from the nectar mission and piloting her sub is Robert Carmichael let's see if we can raise them on the ship on the air sir yeah underwater telephone Kensington Kensington Omega come back I'm gonna pass the off day Anna to interview Lucy talking about [Music] [Music] try again try again hello Lucy can you hear me hello Lucy can you hear us I was just asking you about the reasons you're trying to explore the deep [Applause] Thank You Lucy that's all I've tried and talk to you a little bit later thank you well let's go straight to these pictures we can see now from the from the remote camera and it is of the one of the submersibles and we are expecting them back any moment now so extraordinary rolling going on with submerse wasn't a submersibles good roll but they they certainly can and I'm joined actually by Professor Louise Allcock who is with the science mission here and there's a thing or two about this what do you make of these pictures I think you'll probably find it's the remotely operated vehicle that's rolling I've never seen this up roll but what do you make of the picture what we see in this morning I mean I I think it's fantastic really we're in somewhere we've never been before nobody's ever been here we're looking at a you know a fantastic new environment our job is now just to try and work out exactly what it is down there do a little bit of systematics check the species of coral so that we can catalog it all probably so we've got a lot of work to do later yes so you will be going down in these submersibles or your members will and this is the way that you can pick up samples that's right one of the subs is equipped with them a stereo camera system so that we get really good video and we've got cameras in various places actually they're pointing downwards pointing forwards and we've got a set on the side as well in case were in strong currents and we have to sort of power along a wall and so we've got one sub totally equipped for the camera work and the other sub is equipped with the bio box on the front and the collecting arm and we have a perm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"t to collect five specimen to the earth at each depth that we're working yes I think that that is Anna's son when I can we can see her they're preparing to make return to the to the surface which probably very pleased about she's had a wonderful trip I mean it is for someone like and they're going down like this for the first time it is just the most intriguing sort of other world I think it's an amazing feeling I mean I've been in plans for almost 30 years and I had my first submersible time wagon Alfonzo and it was just incredible that the sort of feeling of calm sitting and we were sitting on the bottom at 200 meters and then we just turned the lights out and all the fish came when it was just amazing I mean the serene scientists I just found it the best thing ever yes and you can't rush the ascent it's a fairly slow process isn't it I think everything is everything is slow you know they don't go particularly fast the subs we don't need them to go fast because if we want good camera pictures we need a very slow transit so so they work perfectly for what we're we're trying to get out of them yes well we expect her back in just a few moments say a professor or coach just tell what is your role in all this so I came on board actually to bring a bit more experience with them camera systems and deep water operations so I mostly work with the deep water ROV off the coast of Ireland I've got funding from Science Foundation Ireland to investigate the corals that occur in our deep waters we get corals down to about two and a half thousand metres which is absolutely fantastic we work with camera systems you know these are complicated bits of care trying to get transit thousands of them in fast currents a difficult thing to do and any something that I have a certain amount of experience in and so I came on board to try and get get all this working really and I think we have you know we've developed protocols now that we're running with the subs in very fast currents and we're getting back the imagery that we need for analysis we've talked about it a lot but this place is especially rich obviously as of a rich ecosystem do you think there will be new species species that scientists have found I think it's almost certainly the case I mean some coral species have a global distribution and they put out you know larvae and these travel around the world in global keratin and there are some coral species that are really found all over the world and then there are other coral species that have very distinctive distributions often they even in the same ocean delimited by death so here 100 meters I get a different species of coral looks quite similar but it's this thing so the chances of us finding new coral species here I would've 400 percent Aldabra so remote something here so quite a proportion of what's here Summer Sun will be global species but and some will be Indian Ocean specific species but but someone we knew okay well what we can see is at the bottom in that submersible and she is on the way to the surface so as a communication the receiver that we were using to communicate is out of the water now so we can't communicate with you just see her and the what you can see in the foreground is the front of the remotely controlled camera and that is what is producing these pictures at the moment and she's about two minutes away from surfacing here in Aldebaran so we hear a lot professor about you know bleaching events and the warm waters impacting on the coral any sign so far about so I haven't lived on the surface Coral Sea there's a dive team going out this afternoon to look at surface coral so really I look so far has been in the deep water corals and we won't expect to see such an impact here there's a thermic line here at about 70 80 meters just explain what a thermic line is so thermic line is where the temperature changes really suddenly so down to about 70 80 meters the temperatures around 28 30 degrees below there it drops steeply to them eight degrees and so in that cold water bleaching is not going to be the same issue also once you get deep enough of course these corals they're in really deep water don't have the symbiotic algae that the shallow water corals have so there is some light at the depths we've been that today in fact the waters very clear and there's a reasonable amount of light but as you get down to 250 300 even 500 meters where we're going there's less light and there different sorts of corals that wouldn't suffer completely the same way [Music] but you've been in these submersibles what's it live in it is a very conservative very tiny other they are small there they are built for function non comfort should we say yes they can get extremely humid in there in fact one of my jobs that was to empty all the walls and the condensation from the air conditioning but even there that the ignition doesn't really work very well because they'd like to preserve the the battery life these this sub pilots so they they have it warm you get extremely dehydrated you can't stretch your legs and that's something that animal really notice even though she's apparently they're about fifty feet from the surface now yep so they will see a marked increase in the intensity of light now they'll be able to see the Sun pouring through the surface layer perhaps they'll be venting an awful lot of air from the the submersible itself and as they rise they may be going at the same speed of the bubble which is a very strange feeling that you are servicing that rapidly and then that dome will break the surface and there they will see in that picture really wonderful pictures aren't they to see the submersible addressed like that is quite extraordinary and you can see the power of the Sun and it is that Sun that drives the marine ecosystem the more intense the light the greater the chance of course the coral making energy and growing there says apparel for coral to that the combination light intensity and warm water can spell coral bleaching and there we are there is an abortion in her submersible and well done to the pilot Randy and I'm sure he's now communicating with the little rib boat they've got off this ship which will go out and pick up Anna after what has been I mean I have to say just an amazing experience I'm sure for her she was very excited this morning certainly when she knew that this was going to happen because of course there are lots of things that can stop these things happening and have stopped these things happening for sure and there this the wave conditions of course have been quite benign here but the currents have been the challenge really wherever we have been in the Seychelles and we are diving next to these enormous sea bounds they get very unpredictable very strong currents and partly because nobody has mapped the seafloor here in a hundred years so we have on board a team that is doing exactly that using much more up-to-date equipment back in the 1800's they were throwing ropes over with net weights at the end trying to gauge the depth but now they're using sonar and it is much more accurate and produces quite exquisite colorful maps very detailed maps and that will definitely be a legacy of this mission well there's detailed notes in there that are not washing is just putting away she'll need those again drink of water earlier and she will have deserved every bit of that but I have to say that this is worth still watching because the very difficult maneuver about to happen which is our presenter getting out of that thing and onto a rib which could be well they were typically the most entertaining move of the entire last hour or so but and it's a serious point so that are the rib has to go out yes the pilot will stay in the submersible controlling submersible and then how what they do is they pick up and I take out a back the pilot will eventually get out and then the submersible will be lifted crane lifted out of the water is that right it is indeed so Anna the first thing will happen is that the hatch there will will open when the support diver is a sports swimmer is there on board he'll clamber on the back of a sub you can see the Front's are beginning to submerged slightly below the surface but he'll clamber on on board he'll open up the hatch then Anna needs to stretch those legs that have been crumpled up for the last few hours stand on her seed stand on another console and then clamber up through that hatch and try not to lose her Bauman's mark as the waves gently rocked their submersible and then of course she will make her way down to the rib that you see there as they're going off the back of our mothership lifting off the crane that took back that ship down that boat down yeah mate around watch how she does this because I've got to do it tomorrow because it's my turn down there tomorrow and I have to say it is a very exciting prospect which was a plastic plastic tomorrow the question impact of plastic tomorrow and Anna will be on one of these extraordinary beaches where even here I mean even here one of the most inaccessible sanctuaries inaccessible islands in Indian Ocean very difficult to even hear plastic tons of it I'm told is washing up you've been there yes I'm so getting plastic and I saw wildlife being trapped in consuming it and that's the the peril for there we can hear the the crane just firing up driver going into his cab and that is the the crane that will be lifting Anna's submersible out of the water thankfully not while she's still on board there you can see the the rescue swimmer they're just drying off the the top of the the hatch because if you open that with the water still there all that would pour into the cabin and the most sensitive electronics that have kept Hannah and Randy alive I have to say I never thought that and the botting exiting a submersible would ever be alive television event but my suspicion well it's something isn't it what she's just done well you can see Randy inside also doing the same to the rag trying to dry it off so that she can make a slightly drier exit that she would have done otherwise yeah and my answer had Marcus yeah the longer they wait in there the hotter that's getting because there and the other submersed will be coming up soon and and they've effectively been down there yes how does the survey surveying they have what they call stereoscopy but it's going to be the transfer from the submersible to the rib the little inflatable that comes along son hold on Anna please they ruin this now that's quite rough isn't it so the inflatable will come in and you should see that any moment so here it is and now this this little sort of well I said how would you describe as a little shop but across or a boat and that so we're going to stay together and not be separated by the Indian in the nations well you see the driver of the boat they're struggling to get the right position yeah is struggling over this a little bit so what do they do if just tossed out the magnet she's not he's got a little bit there Marine grabs the boat tenable at the TV sideshow this moment [Music] whew she's done it give us a wave and I forget to say no idea she's on live television but there we are so she is away she'll be brought back now to the ship and the pilot pilot will also exit exit now but these submersibles used as we saw during that previous hour for a very serious point they have these robotic arms they take the samples you put the samples in the submersibles and bring them up here for the scientists that we be talking to to start with you yes because they're looking for new species and the only way of doing that has been to the surface where they can actually do some analysis they can catalog those species of coral for the miniature of the Seychelles but also they have lots of cameras onboard their submersibles at some point afford something down they have what they call stereoscopic cameras as I was about to tell you before and those are 3d cameras where they can try and understand the structure of the rebreather of the complexity of that reef there's an awful lot of science that he's done as these subs travel on mother called transects marked distances along the reef where they will be counting life and also that the different species of life and that really is the kind of work that they'll be doing now and there you can see that they're beginning to prepare the submersible for it to be lifted out by the crane Randy the pilot is still on board you can see him turning on his thrusters there at the back trying to bring the submersible within range of the crane and there you see emerging there the the bottom the hook that Shane will then clip-ons those the ropes that he's holding there above the glass dome of the submersible and in your top left is on their way back and I can't work out Randy is going to go on the that rib as well Thomas just for now thanks very much let's bring in our next guest talking there with Thomas about mapping and surveying the deep and that's what you specialized in that's what you do isn't it so yeah that's what we've been doing on on this FRC we've been hold on hold on if I see what it's done for fast rescue craft so it's normally used for my overboard situations but we've fitted out with all our server equipment so when we get to a location we go out first we survey the areas as Thomas just said before a lot these areas so it's a big it's really a bigger version of the inflatable that we're seeing yeah exactly exactly that it's just a version of that and we're going out and finding a good area in a safe area for the substitue down yeah and your Ana mapping the the how deep the knew about some of the system we've got here that we've Teledyne marine of given to us we've we compact down to about 600 700 meters so we're going from about about 600 meters all the way into about 4 or 5 meters so they're going basically as far offshore as we can get obviously the subs and can only go to 300 meters and the rav goes down to 500 so you can see it all on computer here comes her Randy who was down there with there and with an opposing very experienced two submersible pilot 10 years an American guy who's leaner and actually put this submersible together for this trip he takes it apart and then rebuilds it so he certainly knows what he's highlighting and certainly knows about what he's doing and now the rig will bring Anna who has hard hat battle back on bringing out and Randy background to the ship and hopefully we'll be able to to see them reasonably soon yes are going back to actually now there is the submersible no that is being lifted [Music] back onto me behind us there extraordinary mr. Kephart is a very fantastic have you been there anyone I haven't I've been out every day surveying yes hopefully get a chance to or at the end well look as we watch these pictures of the submersible coming back we were just saying so you have a computer all yes so you can watch what you're yes oh we see the 3d map of the seabed being generated in real time as we're going along that all generates on the computer and then once were finished we come back on board and we show that to the sub pilots and the ROV pilots and then from that informs where they're going to do their dives obviously the areas are looking for these things steep walls and they've been on today so yeah we were out yesterday surveying that find out where it is so we can get the ship in the right position and find some good areas into their science I hope they treat this submersible carefully because that's that's what I'm getting to honey this tomorrow so they don't come back thing down but they've got pretty good at it by now they have got pretty good at it by now yeah I'm sure okay well Mike thanks very much indeed thanks very much and Thomas is back with us Thomas they'll be here a lot longer than we will how long do these missions last and you know what will they do with the information they get well they're away for about seven weeks they'll be going on from algebra to other islands outer islands here at Seychelles again more sea mounts on these underwater mountains and they're trying to understand they're trying to produce a catalogue of life which is so important the Seychelles government has been ahead of the curve on marine protection that they really get it they have already protected 15% of their vast ocean territory that's the size of the UK and they're going to protect another 15% so doubling it by 2020 but what they need to know is what do you protect what is so special what is so rare here in Aldabra to make sure that it is not destroyed by human activity from further afield whether that be climate change or pollution plastic pollution were indeed overfishing these are the issues that can affect these waters and that is why they're desperate to protect the life within two big coral events fairly recently was in 2000 1998 9:30 in the 2009 2 4 3 2016 as well and what impact with those being each bleaching event data called on there boy impact would they have had here and would the call and being able to resist that here so they did affect coral here but interestingly the the coral here in algebra seems to have been more robust although an awful lot of it did bleach that's when it spits out is algae because it can't tolerate the hot water and it just shuts down in effect a bit like when we have a fever we don't feel like eating well the same is true of the coral too so it spits out his food source the algae but what happened elsewhere in the Seychelles is that the warm water persisted and the coral died but here because it's in a marine protected area because there are many more fish feeding all the algae that would otherwise have smothered the reef that coral had a much better chance of recovery so it really has bounced back and that is why you see such abundant marine life here and is this general warming will localized warming or both that's a really good question it is general so every year in the summer of course you would get spikes in temperature here in the water but what is happening now is that the background you like with climate change is increasing so it's coming from a lower trough and the peaks are getting higher each summer and it's that summer peak which is getting a much higher and at the time and much longer and that's what's causing the coal much more problem many more problems and particularly in an El Nino year that's that current of the South Africa South American which doubles up with climate change she'll be back on board which will be very good news after well quite a broadcasting experience for and well for everyone quite a broadcasting experience when they work we'll have seen that live for a while I have to say I was a bit of a skeptic I thought well they'll be cutting back to us because the thing it was there wasn't it and we saw those pictures and and Anna did remarkably well and and there is oliver steeds all of us t2 is the head of the mission and he will welcome Anna back to the to the ship and and I have to say I was talking to her over breakfast this morning is she well she was saying last night that she wasn't nervous and then this morning she admitted that it was all getting a bit tense and then we she was about to get in the submarine there was a storm in the distance and all those things go through one's mind and there's a broadcaster you know you don't do these things very often than they are they're exceptionally interesting and we're exceptionally privileged to do this but they are not challenging nevertheless and not something everybody would want to do let's be honest about it and but she's back and and we're very happy about this I'm standing now with Paris Stefan artists who is one of the scientists at Paris the reasons I've just got you in here is because you have done this already haven't you beat down and you had a look and what did you make of the experience first of all I would like to say it's been an amazing privilege and X or e privilege to be able to dive in algebra yesterday was my first dive in a submersible it was an amazing experience we went to about having 10 meters deep and we saw a lot of healthy-looking ecosystems rich with soft corals and fish so far it looks very good and I hope we will find the same results and shallow and deeper reefs yeah you say it so far looks very good it all looks pretty healthy it all looks pretty healthy no signs of coal disease those times of plastic pollution in the depth we serve it yesterday and fish seem to be abundant with so many different species of sharks manta rays and so I think so [Music] amazing amazing even coming to the surface is amazing because you're coming through surrounded by bubbles and they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger next thing you know it's like you think you're getting rocked up and down and you pop out in the bright sunlight and you see the ship here and it still washing them down and you feel like you feel like from the depths up to the light and you feel that contrast yes all of it all of it usually different all the way through is right now I know coming up is you know what are the best bits I'm just sounds really strange I mean going down as well cos you did it right eat it right down made that first of all and go down quite suddenly even then and then you drop through blue and it's just blue and you and I wasn't waiting to see fish straightaway but it's blue and you until you hit the bottom which is my sandy yeah and then we are riding deeper parts and rocky out and little communities to see SI phan small fish Hooper's gonna shock said clay bar from quite early on the shop didn't want to seem too but they go to investigate who we are what we are they've never seen us before and we drop down to [Music] 175 metres we'll say well we thought that's what we thought with music yes but we can be heard just about but we kept communication yes exactly exactly I mean you see they put this plate down but with lights on there too to be right there so we can look up and see that quite clearly and it's not that the fish seem to my catcher of seven windows yeah there's a shark checking that out as well how did she believe that me because of is she nervous oh let's just work with yeah so I mean it's always exciting and then we did a dive yesterday but today was was the new is a new spy new environment yeah well then he was worrying me because we went down quite early today and I and he began to talk about us running out of mushrooms before we actually go on it said that Devorah me so we parked our selves up as best as best we can in a rocky I've got the grabber arm out to hold up in Soraka state Lucy will emerge with samples and she's been doing serious science down there and we'll be using that for even the cameras to see the enemies perhaps to see the coral and all of that's being reported and then that will all go into a database and properly analyzed so the science is going on even with the cameras on I'm sure we can laser there's a highlight especially when you can see the other sunrise when it's lights on up against this really craggy stable that's when it feels otherworldly and you you see what you must look like because you're just in this lovely pollen from 270 degrees sphere Plus begs me to see so much and then you see what you must look like when you see themself you still get this bug like aliens over 30 seconds left on the program your highlight what was the best moment here [Music] that one always a shot we had 30 seconds we've now got 20 second always the shark and oddly the journey I tell you what it was I think it was right at the beginning well here we are it was lovely and it was broadcasting first in so many ways and it was a wonderful job very well done and you can see all the highlights on the sky tonight we're back tomorrow 8 o'clock Chinese style antics Sky News calm and that is it in the Indonesian [Music]""""]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

113,0,1. Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology,"(March 29, 2010) Stanford professor Robert Sapolsky gave the opening lecture of the course entitled Human Behavioral Biology and explains the basic premise of the course and how he aims to avoid categorical thinking.Stanford Universityhttp://www.stanford.eduStanford Department of Biologyhttp://biology.stanford.edu/Stanford University Channel on YouTubehttp://www.youtube.com/stanford",Stanford,NNnIGh9g6fA,"['[MUSIC PLAYING] Stanford University. This is BIO 150, isn\'t it? OK, just wanted to make sure. So we start off with a scenario. 40-year-old guy--\nquiet, suburban life. Married 15 years,\ntwo kids, 3.5 dogs. Everything\'s standard. Everything\'s going wonderfully. And one day out of nowhere,\nhe punches somebody in the face at work. Totally bizarre,\nout of character. The guy is standing\nthere by the water cooler and makes some comment\non some baseball team, takes exception to it,\npunches him in the face. Utterly strange. Things are quiet. Three months later, his wife\nof 15 years happy marriage discovers he\'s having an affair\nwith a 16-year-old checkout kid down at the Safeway. Really weird. Then three months\nafter that, he absconds with all the money at work,\nembezzles it, disappears, and is never seen again. Three possibilities. First one-- this guy\nis a truly deep creep. Second, he is having the\nmost immature midlife crisis you could ever imagine. Third possibility--\nhe has a mutation in one gene in his head. And what we will\nbe seeing is this is exactly the\nprofile that you get in a certain\nneurological disease where it\'s one gene\nthat\'s out of whack. First demonstration of that. OK, just to get a\nsense of who\'s here, how many of you think there\nis a genetic influence on sexual orientation? OK, how many think it is\npossible for prenatal events to influence your political\nopinions 30 years later? OK, how many think that there\nis a valid way of using biology to understand who\'s\nreligious and who isn\'t? Not quite as many hands there. OK, as long as we\'re\nin that terrain, how many people believe in God? How many people\nbelieve in souls? How many people believe in evil? How many people\nbelieve in free will? That\'s going to change. [LAUGHTER] Oh, I might as well ask. Is there anybody in\nthis room who actually does believe in evolution? Just wanted to make sure. See what we\'re\ndealing with here. OK, how many think that\nthere is a genetic influence and that there is a basic\nbiological difference, sex difference, in\nlevels of aggression? How many think there\'s\nbiological basis of sex differences in intelligence? OK, who thinks it\'s all\nexplained by nature? Who thinks it\'s all\nexplained by nurture? Who thinks there\'s a\nmagnificent, fascinating, nuanced interaction\nbetween nature and nurture? [LAUGHTER] Yay. OK, well everybody\'s\ngoing to get an A+ then. You already have the\ncourse under control. So we start off trying to\nfind something in common. Look at these four\nevents here-- or not, in terms of being\nscraped out there. But these are four\ncircumstances that have something surprising in common. Having your period. Having a brain tumor. Eating a lot of junk food. Taking anabolic steroids. Those of you who\nare not oriented to with, that\'s the ones\nthat build up your muscles like testosterone derivatives. OK, these all have something\nin common-- having your period, having a brain tumor,\neating a lot of junk food, and taking a lot of\nanabolic steroids. Anybody want to fathom a\nguess what\'s the commonality amongst the four of them? Yeah. Hormones? Hormones. Good. OK, we\'re off and\nrunning with hormones. Good. Even more specific than that. Something they all\nhave in common. Oh, come on, somebody\nwant to guess? I see these brief\nmovements of hands there as people\nchange their mind. OK, it all has to\ndo with hormones. They all have\nhormones in common, I say, trying to facilitate\nsomebody making the next guess. Oh, come on. They all have something. OK, we gotta get outta\nhere at some point. These all have four\nthings in common. All of these have been used\nsuccessfully in courts of law to explain the\nbehavior of a murderer. [LAUGHTER] In the first case,\na number of cases where the fact that\na woman was having her period at the time\nof killing someone was part of what a jury said led\nthem to exonerate the person. A literature showing that\na disproportionate share of female aggression comes\naround the time of menses. Next one-- there is an area of\nthe brain you will know so much about over the next three\nmonths called the amygdala that has something\nto do with aggression and has something\nto do with fear. And you get a brain tumor\nthere, and in a number of cases, you get someone who is\nuncontrollably violent. And this has also been used\nsuccessfully in a court of law. Junk food-- any of you who are\nSan Francisco history buffs will know 20 years\nago, 30 years ago that Dan White, a\ndisappointed office seeker, assassinated the mayor of San\nFrancisco along with Harvey Milk. And as part of his\nremarkably successful defense for a double murderer that\nled to a remarkably short jail sentence, was the\nfamed Twinkie defense. The argument that his\naddiction to junk food caused wild fluctuations\nin his blood sugar levels, which caused him to do that. Finally, anabolic steroids. Any number of cases of people\nhaving uncontrolled violence arguing because they were\nweight lifters and a wildly abusive range of\ntaking this stuff had something to\ndo with violence. Put all four of these\ntogether, and we get the first of the two\npoints of this entire course. Which is, sometimes the stuff\nthat\'s going on in your body can dramatically influence\nwhat goes on in your brain. Second critical point-- tonight,\nwhen you\'ve settled back down, and you\'re ready to go to sleep,\nand you\'re nice and relaxed, and your heart\'s\nbeating nice and slow, think the following thought. You know, that heart isn\'t\ngoing to beat forever. Think about your lips\nturning blue after. Think about the blood\nflow slowing down. Think about your feet and\nyour toes getting cold. And at that point,\nyou will probably be increasing the rate at\nwhich that heart beats. And you will have just\nseen the second key thing in this course,\nwhich is sometimes what\'s going on\nin your head will affect every single\noutpost in your body. And what this course is\nabout is the intertwining, the interconnections\nbetween your physiology and your behavior-- the\nunderlying emotions, thoughts, memories, all of\nthat, and the capacity of each to deeply influence the\nother under all sorts of circumstances. Now, what we\'re going\nto be doing with this is trying to understand\nthis under fairly difficult circumstances. If everybody here was\nhere because they really wanted to understand why\nall the wildebeest on earth mate in the same\nweek each year, we\'d have a fighting chance\nof figuring that one out. But that\'s not what\nwe want to understand. We don\'t want to\nunderstand why birds migrate and don\'t get lost. We want to understand\nhuman behavior. Worse than that, harder than\nthat, human social behavior. And hardest of all in some\ncases, some grossly abnormal human behavior. And if you\'re going to\ntry to do that, there is a problem which is,\nofficially, it\'s complicated. It is a huge, messy\nprocess trying to make sense of the biology\nof human social behavior. And just as all\nsorts of realms when one deals with messy,\ncomplicated problems that you need to think about\nin some wildly interacting way, we all have a strategy\nthat we come up with. A strategy to make\nthings easier-- which is that we think in categories. We think in categories. We take things\nthat are continua, and we break them\ninto categories. And we label those categories. And we do that in\nvarious settings because it could be\nextremely useful. For example, somebody give\nme an estimate on how long this line is. [INAUDIBLE] A foot. OK, people who said a\nfoot, what is it that went through your\nhead to figure it out? You imagined how\nlong a ruler is. Is this 11.5 inches because and\nit\'s 11 inches-- an 8.5 by 11. But everybody in here has this\ncategory in their head things that are kind of the\nsame length as a ruler. A continua of lengths, and\nthere\'s a category for that. Suppose I\'m telling you I have\nsome friend who\'s a runner. He runs the mile. He\'s incredibly fast. In fact, he\'s one\nof the best runners in the country at this point. How fast does he have to have\nrun the mile or better for you to be deeply impressed? Under four minutes. And thus, we have another\ncategorical boundary there of there\'s an\ninfinite variety of speeds with which you can run a mile. Yet we have in our heads\nthis boundary-- people who are under four\nminute milers, you are very impressed with. OK, now I want to impress you\nwith another friend of mine who\'s a painter. And this person is\nsuch a great painter that they paint with\n11 different colors. That doesn\'t work because that\'s\nnot a category that we have. We don\'t classify the\nquality-- hopefully not-- we don\'t classify quality\nof paintings along those lines. But we begin to see here\nis in the right areas, we have categories that\nwe impose on things that are not categorical. Here\'s an example. Why should you do this? Where\'d the example go? Here\'s one of the\nclassic continua that we ever deal with, which\nis the continua of color-- the varying wavelengths that\ntake the rainbow from violet to red. And there\'s an infinite\nnumber of spaces in between. And what do we do? We have rules in English that\nyou can divide the continua here and here, or whatever, and\nthat\'s what you call a color. This is red. Everything from here is red. Everything here\nis orange, so on. You take a continua, and you\nbreak it into boundaries. Why do we do that? Because it makes it easier to\nstore the information away. Instead of remembering the\nabsolute features of something, you simply say, it\'s a. It\'s a sub-four minute miler. It\'s a line that\'s about\nthe length of a ruler. It\'s the color orange. How do you know that\'s the case? Because go and take people\nfrom other language groups, where their language\narbitrarily divides the rainbow at other points with completely\ndifferent color terms, and they remember different\nprofiles of colors differently than an English speaker might. Take a color. And if the color comes right in\nthe center of somebody\'s color characterization,\nif it comes right in the middle of the range\nof what counts as that color, people remember whether they\nsaw that color or not far better than if you show them a\ncolor at the boundary. And people will show that as\na function of what language they speak. Taking a continua, and\nyou break it into pieces, because it\'s easier to\ndeal with the facts. Another example of it. Here we have four objects. And as drawn here, simply\nbecause we have categories to describe the\nfirst three, do one of those tests of show\npeople a bunch of shapes, and they come back an\nhour later and ask them, Have you seen this shape before? And people are going to be\nfar more accurate with this than whether they saw\nthis or not because we don\'t have a word for it. We don\'t have a word that\'s\nat all sort of analytical that some squiggly whatever. We don\'t have a\nclear cut category. Thinking in categories\nmakes it easier for us to remember stuff. And it makes it easier\nfor us to evaluate stuff. So that\'s a classic\nsort of response that we have cognitively\nto complicated things. But there\'s a bunch of problems\nwith categorical thinking. First example--\nand first one you can see from a realm of\nlanguage differences-- in that not only is there a\ncontinua of infinite number of wavelengths, there\nis a continua of sounds that humans can make. And different languages draw\nboundaries at different points as to what count as similar\nsounds or different sounds. There\'s like two different\nT-H sounds in English, which apparently we\'re\nnot very good at hearing. But there\'s other ones we are. And that will\naffect your ability to remember stuff-- what\nword it was-- depending on whether it is on a dramatically\ndifferent boundary, whether it is a sound that sounds\ndifferent to you or not. Example of this-- apparently\nin Finnish, people do not differentiate\nbetween the sound of a B and the sound of a P, whereas\nwe have no trouble with that. But people from Finland do\nnot make that differentiation. And I discovered this\none day a number of years ago where, for reasons\nI don\'t even understand, I found myself needing to\ntake to testicular biopsies on baboons. Not having sort of learned that\nin junior high how you do that, I called up this guy at\nurology the med school who happened to be Finnish. And I explained to him\nwhat I wanted to do. And he sort of took\nme through the paces and told me what thingy I needed\nto buy, and that sort of stuff, and holiday packages of those\nwhere you can get a dozen. And sort of telling\nme how to do that. And once we went through he\nsaid, What I want you to do, the thing to do at this\npoint, is get some practice. I want you to\npractice on a bear. [LAUGHTER] And I said, What? He said, Yeah. Practice on a bear. And I said, Are you kidding me? He said, I know. I know it sounds crazy, but we\nhave all the residents do that. It\'s a very good\nlearning device. Either practice on\na bear or an apple. Oh. Oh. Here we see the dangers\nof making mistakes about differences between B and\nP under certain circumstances. So we see one of\nthe dangers there, which is when you are paying too\nmuch attention to categories, you can\'t differentiate\ntwo facts that fall within the same category. Next example. I remember back at various\npoints of anxiety during exams, and such back when\nwhere there was a world of difference between\ngetting a 65 on a test and a 66 on a test. Not particularly different. But because there is\nthis boundary drawn there between passing and failing,\nthere is this dramatic differentiating we make. When you put up\nboundaries, you have trouble seeing how\nsimilar things are on either side of it. Next example, one\nadditional problem that you get when you\nthink categorically. And for this,\neverybody needs to turn over one of the\npieces of paper-- the paper you\'re going to\nhand in, the questionnaire. And what I\'m going to do is read\nyou a series of phone numbers, and I want you to write them\ndown as accurately as possible. OK, ready? 243-2649, 650-3260, 256-5779,\n832-2449, 291-3171, 231-4026, 593-2449, 743-8840, 831-5287. OK. Now what that\nexercise is-- and no, that doesn\'t count\ntowards the grade. What that will\nshow, I\'m sure, when in some obsessive burst\nof procrastination I actually look\nthrough the answers tonight, what it\'s going\nto show is the accuracy is going to tank the second\nyou go from the phone number pattern of three digits followed\nby four, break up that pattern. And suddenly we all get screwed\nup because we\'re saying, Wait a second. I thought it was a phone number. That was one digit. Now two digits. I can\'t. And it\'s gone, and you\'re\non to the next one. And what we see there is\nthe third example, which is when you pay too much\nattention to boundaries, you don\'t see the big picture. All you see are categories. All you see are, Wait\na second, phone numbers are supposed to come with\nthree digits followed by four. Another example where we\nuse categorical thinking. OK, I\'m putting up a\nnumber series here. OK. What\'s-- oh, my god. OK, what\'s the next\nnumber in this series? And why? [INAUDIBLE] 42. How come? [INAUDIBLE] OK, so we\'re kind of oscillating\nall over the place there. OK, so that\'s as valid\nas anybody else\'s. Who else has a next\nnumber in line there? [INAUDIBLE] What\'s that? [INAUDIBLE] 45. How come? [INAUDIBLE] OK. Are you going to take that? 45. That\'s very-- OK. What else? Let me make it a\nlittle bit easier here. OK. So what\'s the next\nnumber in that series? And what I\'m telling\nyou is if you think about the world with a certain\nset of categories in your head, you will know the next\nnumber in the sequence. So what\'s the next one? [INAUDIBLE] Seven billion. [INAUDIBLE] OK. That one. OK. Seven billion. That\'s another possibility. Although presumably, it\nwould be seven billionth. Anything else? Any other guesses here\nas to what happens next? 4th, 14th, 23rd, 34th. What\'s the next one\nin the sequence yes? [INAUDIBLE] 44. How come? [INAUDIBLE] OK. But remember, it\'s\ngot to be 44th. What\'s that? Ordinal? Cardinal? Whatever it is. What? 42nd. How come? The subway? You were right. You were right. Anybody who is a New Yorker\nwill know what the next one is. These are the subway stops. And you get a bagel\nwith cream cheese. [APPLAUSE] So you get New Yorkers,\nand while everybody else is thinking logical things\nlike 43, and 41, and 45, and seven billion,\nand all of that, you\'ve got this whole world\nof dividing numbers by. Subway stops. We think in categories. We think in categories. But as you just saw,\nthere are these problems. First one being, when\nyou think in categories, you underestimate how\ndifferent two facts are when they fall in the same category. When you think in\ncategories, you overestimate how\ndifferent they are when there happens to be a\nboundary in between them. And when you pay attention\nto categorical boundaries, you don\'t see big pictures. Now, what our goal in this\nclass is going to be is think about this\nbig, complex issue of the biology of\nbehavior without falling into thinking in categories. What do I mean in this regard? Thinking categorically\nabout a subject like this? There\'s some chicken. And the chicken is\nstanding somewhere. And there\'s some\nrooster over there that does some sexually\nsolicitive, exciting thing for the female. And in response to\nthat, the female picks up and goes running\nover to the rooster. And thus, we have our first\nbehavioral biology question here. Why did that chicken\ncross the road? To get to that rooster. So you could answer that\nlike an endocrinologist and say, Well the female had\ncertain levels of estrogen in her bloodstream, which\nmade this key hypothalic areas responsive to the stimulus. Or you could answer\nit like an anatomist, saying, Well, because\nthe fulcrum of her pelvis or whatever it is chickens\nhave that allow them to run. Or you could answer\nit in the category of an evolutionary biologist. That over the\nmillennia, chickens that didn\'t respond to sexually\nsolicitive gesture from males left fewer copies\nof their genes. And there\'s all these\ndifferent categories that we can use to\nexplain what\'s going on. All of these different buckets. All of these different\nbuckets which begin to pull you towards all\nof the problems we just saw. Now, having trouble telling how\ndifferent or similar two facts are. Having trouble\nseeing big pictures. Over emphasizing the\nimportance of the bucket you happen to live inside of. And thus, suddenly everything\nabout this behavior is explained by a gene, a\nneurotransmitter, a childhood trauma, a living\ninside one bucket. Whet we are going to be\ndoing over and over in here as the main point of the course\nis looking at how what goes on in your body influences\nbehavior, emotions, memories. How what goes on there\ninfluences your body, looping over. And at every one\nof those points, resisting the pull to\nthink categorically. Oh, this is the explanation for\nwhere this behavior came from. Here\'s what we\'re going\nto be doing instead throughout in terms of\nthe structure of the class when we get to actual behaviors. For each behavioral\ncategory, we will start off by looking at what the\nbehavior looks like. Because often, that takes\na lot more objectivity than we initially assume. What does the\nbehavior look like? Then we will say, Well, what\nwent on in that organism a half second before\nthat behavior occurred to cause it to occur? Which is the world of what\'s\ngoing on with neurons. What\'s going on with circuitry. Where\'s the explanation\nfor the behavior. Aha. This behavior happened\nbecause this part of the brain got activated. But just as we\'re about\nto settle in happily into that bucket,\nwe push back a bit and say, Well, what\nsmell, what sound, what sensory stimulation\nin the environment caused those neurons\nto get activated and produce that behavior? And then pushing one\nstep further behind. OK, well, what do hormone\nlevels, various hormones in the bloodstream of\nthat animal or individual for the past few hours,\nhow do those hormones change how sensitive you\nare to those sounds, smells, et cetera, that\ncause those neurons to get activated and\nproduce the behavior? And all we\'re going to be\ndoing is working our way back, all the way through early\ndevelopment, fetal life, the genetic makeup up of an\nindividual, the genetic makeup up entire populations, species,\nthe evolutionary pressure on, all the way back to there. How do you explain each\none of these behaviors in the context of\nthose outposts? And how are they\nnot really outposts? All they are, are different\nways of expressing the same biological influences. If you say, Ooh,\nhere\'s a hormone that explains this behavior. This behavior is caused\nby Hormone X. Hormone X is coded for by a gene. So suddenly you\'re not just\ntalking about endocrinology. You\'re talking about genetics. And if there\'s a\ngene there, it has been the subject to selection. So suddenly you\'re\ntalking about evolution. If you were talking about what\nsmells, sights, et cetera, are the acute triggers\nfor a behavior, by definition\nyou\'re also talking about fetal development\nthat determined how sensitive those systems\nwere to those sorts of stimuli. What we\'re going to be\nhaving over and over again is any one of these buckets\nthat we spend some time in, all we\'re going to do is think\nof that bucket is at that point the most convenient\nway of describing all of the influences\nthat came beforehand. And in that regard,\nthere\'s no buckets. All they are, are\ntemporary platforms. And each platform is simply the\neasiest, most convenient way of describing the outcome of\neverything that came beforehand starting with millennia\nback in evolution. OK. So that sounds great. That\'s what we\'re going to do. We\'re going to do this. And we\'re going to be very\nsophisticated and fancy in our thinking about it. And we\'re not going to fall\nfor categorical thinking. OK, this is a complicated\nsubject, and we\'re smart. So we\'re going to try to\nthink about it smartly. That\'s great. But like maybe this is just an\nirritating song and dance here of, Ooh, we\'re not going to\nfall for categorical thinking like people out there. Obviously when\npeople are thinking about stuff like behavior, and\nthey do this professionally, professional biologists, yes,\nand they understand also. This is just the strawman. Ooh, we\'re going to be more\nsophisticated in our thinking than endocrinologists, and\ngeneticists, and all of those. They obviously know that\nthese things interact, and there\'s not just\none explanation. And it\'s just the\narea they focus on. They understand that. Let me read you a\nfew quotes to show just how much some of these\nfolks don\'t understand that. First quote. ""Give me a child at birth\nfrom any background, and let me control the total\nenvironment in which he is raised, and I will\nturn him into anything I wish him to be--\nwhether doctor, lawyer, or beggar, or thief."" This was John Watson, 1912,\none of the founding fathers of the school of psychology\ncalled behaviorism. Behaviorism-- that sort\nof reached its apogee with this guy BF\nSkinner in the 1950s. This notion that if\nyou could control the rewards, the\npunishments, the positive, the negative reinforcements,\nyou could turn anybody into anything you want,\nwhether doctor, lawyer, beggar, or thief. And we know that isn\'t the case. We know that\'s not possible. We know that. All you have to do is\nthrow in one other factor and like a lot of protein\nmalnutrition during fetal life, and you\'re not going\nto be able to do that. That being a crude example of\njust how wrong this guy was. You cannot have all the control\nover the environment and turn somebody into whatever you want. Here\'s a guy living\npathologically in this bucket that behavior could be explained\nsolely by understanding reward and punishment. Interesting factoid--\nthis John Watson guy. Shortly after that,\nhe was driven out of academia for a wild scandal\nthat he was involved in. And he spent the\nrest of his career apparently as an extremely\nsuccessful advertising executive. Going to show you\nsomething-- he may not have been able to turn\npeople into anything he wanted, but\napparently he could make them buy all sorts\nof geegaw nonsense. OK, next quote. ""Normal psychic life depends\nupon the good functioning of brain synapses."" If you don\'t know what synapses\nare, don\'t panic at this point. They\'re ways brain cells\nconnect with each other. OK. ""Normal psychic life\ndepends on the good functioning of brain synapses,\nand mental disorders appear as a result of the\nsynaptic derangements. Synaptic adjustments will then\nmodify the corresponding ideas and force them into\ndifferent channels. Using this approach, we\nobtained cures and improvements but no failures."" Synaptic adjustments. What do you suppose those little\nold synaptic adjustments are that this guy is referring to? Any guesses? [INAUDIBLE] Somebody shout it out. [INAUDIBLE] Electroshock therapy. Electroshock therapy-- you\nknow, a little synaptic. You wish it were as gentle\nas electroshock therapy. This is even more dramatic\nsynaptic adjustments. Any other guesses? [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, frontal lobotomies. You want to adjust\nsomebody\'s synapses, so you slice off the front\nthird of their brain or so. This was Egas Moniz, a\nPortuguese neurologist who invented frontal lobotomies. It had a different\nname at the time. But was the person\nwho started this, and something that was done to\ntens and hundreds of thousands of people who had absolutely\nnothing wrong with them. One of the darkest chapters\nof where psychiatry gets in bed with ideology. Massive criminal destruction\nof people\'s brains. This is what he had to say about\nthe procedure on his acceptance of his Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology and Medicine for having invented it. So here we have\nsomebody pathologically living in a world of understand\nhow synapses are working, adjust them. And with that, we obtain\ncures and improvements but no failures. Final quote. Worst one of all. ""The selection\nfor social utility must be accomplished by\nsome social institution if mankind is not to be\nruined by domestication induced degeneracy. The racial idea as\nthe basis of our state has already accomplished\nmuch in this respect. We may, and we must, rely\non the healthy instincts of the best of our people\nfor the extermination of elements of the population\nloaded with dregs."" Anybody want to\nguess who that was? [INAUDIBLE] Hitler? Hitler, that\nbehavioral biologist. He was a little bit\nbusy at the time. This was instead one of Hitler\'s\nmain scientific propagandists. This was somebody living\npathologically in a box-- a box that doesn\'t even\nexist-- having notion of race, and ethnicity, and\ngenetics, and all of that, saying let me fix that one. Let me exterminate the elements\nof the population loaded with dregs, and I\'ll fix up\nthat little problem of fixing something that ain\'t broken. Who was this? This was a scientist\nnamed Conrad Lorenz. Conrad Lorenz, who probably a\nlot of us are familiar with. Conrad Lorenz was one of the\nfounding fathers of ethology. We\'ll learn all about that. But he, like everybody\nknows him winding up in all the little\nkid nature books, Conrad Lorenz discovered\nimprinting in birds. And he\'d be going around. He was this little Austrian guy\nwith this cherubic white beard. And he\'d always have these\nlittle Austrian shorts and suspenders. And there would be a whole\nbunch of duckies following him because they thought he\nwas mom, and he was totally charming and irresistible. This sort of old imprinting\nwith his ducky kids. And he also happened to be a\nrabid Nazi propagandists who went to his grave\nsaying that there was nothing wrong with what he did. These are not crappy,\nfourth-rate scientists. These are not people working\nat the University of the Desert of Podunk or whatever. These are among the most\ninfluential scientists of the last century. These are people who influenced\nhow people were educated, and when we decided it wasn\'t\nworth the effort of doing it. These are people whose influence\nled to the brains being destroyed of\nhundreds of thousands of people who had\nnothing wrong with them. These are the people\nwho led to the notion that you fix up a problem that\ndoesn\'t exist by exterminating nine million people. These are not minor scientists. These are the most\ninfluential people of the last century coming\nout of science in many ways living pathologically\ninside their own buckets and how they could\nexplain the entire world. And thus, again, our goal is\ngoing to not fall for that. To think about human\nbehaviors, and in some cases to think about some\nof the most disturbed, some of the most\nfrightening, damaged human behaviors, and\nresist the temptation to think inside a bucket\nand find the explanation. Again, every level we\'re\ngoing to talk about-- genes, hormones, neurons, environmental\ninfluence, whatever it is-- that point will simply\nbe the easiest way of describing all of the\ninfluences that came before. They\'re not even\ntemporary buckets. There\'s no buckets. That will be our goal. Now, in thinking about\nthis and approaching human behavior, the biology\nof human social behavior, often the biology of abnormal\nhuman social behavior, we\'re going to have three\nintellectual challenges. The first one is\nrecognizing circumstances where there is nothing\nfancy about us whatsoever. We are just like every\nother animal out there. And where the challenge\nis to accept that. Let me give you an example. You are a hamster. You are a female hamster. And you\'re sitting in your cage. And, as a female\nhamster, what you do is you ovulate every\nfive days or so. And you\'re going\nabout your business, and everything\'s great. Now, somebody puts\nanother female hamster in the cage with you. And over the subsequent month or\nso, what happens is both of you will begin to\nlengthen your cycles and eventually synchronize\nthem so that you are both ovulating the same afternoon\non a regular basis. Amazing. This actually works this way. And menstrual ovulatory\nsynchrony-- people understand how this\nworks in hamsters. It is done with olfaction,\nwith pheromones, with chemical airborne signals\nfrom one female to another. And you can prove this\nby electrically recording from olfactory systems. Or, if you don\'t\nhave much funding, you could take like a paper clip\nover the female hamster\'s nose, and she doesn\'t\nsynchronize then. It\'s all done with olfaction. And what\'s most amazing is you\nput the two females together, and there is a way\nof disrupting it. Put a male hamster in there,\nand suddenly the cycles desynchronize and shorten,\nand you break it up with male pheromones. And what\'s even more remarkable\nis you put the two females together, and it\'s not random\nwho synchronizes the other one. The dominant female synchronizes\nthe subordinate one. Totally understood. People have been working\non this for years. And it works this way in goats,\nand sheep, and dogs, and cats, and pigs. Apparently, you could go to\na 7-Eleven somewhere in Iowa, and you could buy a can of pig\novulatory synchronization spray and take it home,\nand just run wild. I have no idea why you\nwould want to do that. But nonetheless,\nthat\'s how you-- it\'s up there with the cans\nof Cheese Whiz or whatever. And it\'s that well understood. And what\'s remarkable is it\nworks exactly the same way in us humans, where it is\nknown as the Wellesley Effect. The fact that over\nthe course of freshman year, this was first\nshown in Wellesley, 1970. Over the course of\nfreshman year, women-- freshman year roommates-- tended\nto lengthen and synchronize their cycles. And it was done with olfaction. Women who had olfactory\ndeficits didn\'t synchronize with their roommates. They would synchronize\nunless they were having close\nintimate relationships with a male, in which\ncase they desynchronized. And what\'s most cruel of\nall is, it\'s not random who synchronizes to who. The studies tend to show is the\nindividual who is more socially outgoing, extroverted,\ndominating, is the one who synchronizes the other one. And this is well\nenough understood that when I went\nin college, people would sit around at the dinner\ntable and say stuff like, Oh, when we roomed\ntogether in th",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 summer, I had her synchronized\nby August 1st. This is what happens if you\nhang out with biologists. But we\'re exactly the same. The challenge here\nis recognizing there is nothing fancy about us. At various points\nin the class, we will look at comparisons between\nthe human and the chimp genome, and it\'s virtually the same. Some of the time, we are just a\nplain old off-the-rack animal. Second challenge is going to be\ncircumstances where we appear to be just like everybody\nelse, all the other organisms out there, but we\ndo something very different with the similarity. Let me give you an example here. You have two humans,\ntwo individuals, who are going through a ritual. They are sitting at a table. They\'re absolutely silent. They\'re making no\neye contact, and they do nothing more physically\ntaxing than every now and then, one of them\npicks up their hand and moves a little piece\nof wood on the table. And if these happen\nto be the right two individuals in the middle of a\nchess grandmaster tournament, these people are\nmaintaining blood pressure for six hours running that you\nonly see in a marathon runner. These people are going through\nthousands of calories a day doing nothing more\nthan thinking. And this is outrageous. Because you look at\none of these chess grandmasters who\'s just\ntaken down an opponent and took their\nqueen, or whatever, and they will have the\nexact same physiology as some male baboon\non the Savannah who\'s just ripped the stomach\nopen of his worst rival. And we\'re doing it\nthere just with thought. And some of the time what\'s\nremarkable about us is we have absolutely typical,\nboring physiology, but we use it in ways that\nno other animal could. We get stressed by the\ninevitability of our mortality. We get stressed by reading\nsomething awful that has happened to a child on\nthe other side of the planet. We get stressed by\nsomebody zooming past us in some sports car, and\nwe decide that we are now economically inadequate. And you never even\nsee the person\'s face. You just see the car. We get stressed reading about\nsomething awful happening to a character in a novel. This is a whole realm\nof things that we could do that nobody else does. And on the flip side, we can\nfeel compassion and empathy for a loved one. But we can also do\nthe same for someone on the other side of the\nplanet in a refugee camp. We can feel compassion for\na member of another species. We feel badly when\nour pets are injured. This is another realm where the\nphysiology of the response-- the empathy, the emotional\nbonding, all of that-- it\'s the same boring physiology\nas every other animal out there, and we are\nusing it in a way that is unrecognizable. Now, some of the\ntime the challenge is the third category, which\nis when we are doing something that no other\nanimal out there has anything remotely similar to. Let me give you an example\nhere, a shocking example. You have a couple. They live together. They come back at the\nend of the day from work. They talk. They eat dinner. They talk some more. They go to bed,\nand they have sex. They talk some more. They fall asleep. The next day, they do\nthe same exact thing. They come home from work. They talk. They eat. They talk. They go to bed. They have sex. They talk some more. They do this every single\nnight for 30 days running. Hippos would be\nrepulsed by this. Because hardly anybody out\nthere in the animal kingdom has non-reproductive sex,\nlet alone day after day. And nobody else out there\ntalks about it afterward. And what we\'ve got here\nis a whole novel domain of human behavior-- language\nuse, aspects of our sexuality, this profoundly damaging\nhuman uniqueness of some individuals confusing\naspects of sexuality with aggression. In some cases, we are going\nto be out there on our own trying to understand what\'s up. OK. So that will be the general\nstrategy for the course. We will resist\ncategorical thinking over, and over, and over. Not just because that\'s cool,\nand nuanced, and subtle, all of that. But fall into\ncategorical thinking, and you can do unspeakable\ndamage in a realm of science that makes the difference. We will do so thinking\nconstantly about ourselves as a boring species just like\nall the others out there. As a species that has the\nsame boring physiology, but uses it in ways\nthat are unrecognizable. As a species that does\nsome things that are simply without precedent out there. And constantly struggling\nwith what does biology have to do with it? General structure of the\ncourse-- the first half of the course is going\nto be an overview, an introduction to\nthe various buckets, the various categories. And what we\'re\ngoing to go through is understanding an introduction\nto evolutionary theory, an introduction to what\nmolecular genetics has to do with behavior,\nbehavioral genetics, ethology, the brain, endocrinology,\neach of these buckets. And you know what\nhappens next, which is in the second\nhalf of the course. We will look at specific\nbehaviors, and in each case rip apart the buckets. And in each case,\ndo the strategy of what does the\nbehavior look like? What happened a second before? The world of neurons. What happened with the\nsensory stimuli that trigger those neurons, et cetera? All the way back to the\nevolutionary selective pressures. So the first half\nof the course is going to be the\nintroduction to the buckets. And I will tell you\nright off the bat it is a total pain in the rear. Because what we\'re\ngoing to be doing is like every 2.5 lectures--\njust when you were getting the vocabulary\ndown-- we\'re going to jump to a completely\ndifferent bucket. It is going to be dizzying, and\nunpleasant, and all of that. And then second\nhalf of the course, oh, the rewards finally come\nof then putting all the pieces together, looking at individual\ncategories of behavior-- sexual behavior, aggressive\nbehavior, parental behavior, schizophrenia, depression,\npersonality disorders, language use. In each of these cases, what\'s\ngoing on a second before? What\'s going on 10\nmillion years before? Where do all these buckets\ndisappear in the interactions? So that\'s going to be the\nstrategy for the course. Something critical about\nhow the course was designed is it\'s got no prerequisites. Because I really think this is a\nsubject that everybody on Earth should be forced to learn\nabout it at gunpoint. And thus, it\'s a\ngood thing, I think, to have this not be one of\nthose upper level bio classes. Let me just get a\nsense of who\'s here. How many of you are bio\ntypes, bio majors, hum bio? Psychology? Anthro? Are there any English Lit\ngrad students in here? Yeah. OK. Good for you. Thank you for coming here. See what you think\nin three months. But nonetheless, the class\nhas been designed explicitly to have no background\nwhatsoever. How are we going to do that? We\'re going to do the usual song\nand dance of weekly sections, and reviews, and all\nthat sort of thing. But in addition,\nduring this first half of the course when we\'re jumping\nfrom category to category, we\'re going to have each\nweek additional sections-- a catchup section--\nwhich is for people who have no background\nin that area, getting you through the\nbasics, and getting you up to speed so that you\nwill be able to then know what\'s up during the lectures. So those will be posted. The first one of these is--\nlet me make sure I\'ve got this. Yes. It will be Thursday at\n7:30 in the room next door. And this is going to\nbe the introduction to evolutionary\ntheory and getting you ready for what will be the\nevolution lectures Wednesday and Friday of this week. If you don\'t have a\nstrong background, go to these catchup sections. The TAs who will be\ngiving that are really expert in those areas, lots\nof background, and this will be your chance to catchup. Look through the handout. I think I have a\nbunch of terms there or something where if\nyou are not terribly familiar with those terms in\nsome discipline, that\'s a sign that you should probably go\nfor some of the catchup stuff. If you really are\njust doing this, sort of being very adventurous\nwith no background, if you can take it pass/fail,\nthat will take off a lot of the pressure as well. Because you could then actually\npay attention to stuff here. And the whole\npoint here is to be able to do this even if\nyou don\'t have a science background. Because the obvious\nargument I would make is everybody has to\nlearn behavioral biology because we\'re being behavioral\nbiologists every time we serve on a jury. Every time we vote\nwhether or not money should be spent\non solving some problem, whether it\'s a problem, and\nwhether it\'s solvable or not. Every time we try to\nmake sense of a family member sunk in depression. Are they having a\nbiochemical disorder, or are they just\nindulging themselves? We\'re behavioral\nbiologists all the time. So it\'s probably a good thing\nthat we be informed ones. So the catchup sections\nthere-- take advantage of them. What else? We will have weekly\nsections, the usual type. People are not\nassigned to sections. There\'s going to be 18 of them\nor so a week at various times. Go to whichever works for you. There will be a midterm in\nthe middle, the midterm coming as we finish the last of\nthose categories, last of those buckets. There will be a final. There\'s no paper or\nanything like that. So that will be the pattern. What else? Other stuff here. Office hours-- my office\nhours are up on the handout. Other things-- breaks. We will, with any\nluck, be able to be able to be organized enough\nso that during each stretch of class, there will be a five\nminute break in the middle so you can stand\nup, and just get to the front of the\nline for the bathroom, and then we will resume promptly\nbefore you get in there. So just to let you\nclear your heads a bit. Assignments, books, reading. There are two books that I\nhave assigned for the course. One is by me. And you don\'t even\nhave to read it. Just go buy a bunch of copies\nof and bring me the receipt, and you\'ve got a\ngreat grade in there. OK, so that\'s what\nis going to be pertinent to the second\nhalf of the course. We\'re going to give you a\nlist of the chapters that make the most sense to read. The other book is a\nbook by an author named James Gleick called Chaos. Chaos, year, after year,\nafter year, in this class provokes the strongest opinions. A quarter of the\npeople decide it is the most irritating,\nirrelevant thing that could possibly have been\nassigned in the class and hate it. About half the\npeople never quite figure out what\'s up with it. And a quarter of the people,\ntheir life is transformed. They no longer have to meditate. They no longer have to\nhave a-- they are at peace. At peace, I tell you. Because what this\nbook does is introduce this whole radically different\nway of thinking about biology, taking apart a world\nof reductionism. For 500 years, we all have\nbeen using a very simple model for thinking about\nliving systems. Which is, if you want\nto understand something that\'s complicated, you break\nit apart into its little pieces. And once you understand\nthe little pieces and put it back\ntogether, you will understand the complex thing. And what Chaos as an\nentire field is about-- and this was pretty\nmuch the first book that was meant for the lay public\nabout it-- what Chaos shows is that\'s how you fix clocks. That\'s not how\nyou fix behaviors. That\'s not how you\nunderstand behaviors. Behavior is not like a clock. Behavior is like a cloud. And you don\'t\nunderstand rainfall by breaking a cloud down\ninto its component pieces and gluing them back together. So read through that book. A lot of it is from physical\nsciences rather than biological, so we\'ll\njust be suggesting the chapters you should read. I will tell you it\nis the first book since Baby Beluga where\nI\'ve gotten to the last page and immediately started reading\nit over again from the front. Because along with\nBaby Beluga, it\'s had the greatest\ninfluence on my life. I found this to be the most\ninfluential book in my thinking about science since college. So that is a sign. There will also be\na bunch of lectures in the second half of the course\ncovering these fields of chaos and complexity. And if you really\nthink about it, it is going to force a\nchange in everything else that you bring to thinking\nabout this subject. In addition, at this moment\nthere is not a reader. Because I\'m trying to\navoid having to get you guys to have\nto buy a reader. I\'m trying to redo all\nthe assigned readings so that will just be from papers\nthat are available online, that you\'ll be able to download. I\'m about halfway through\ngetting them there. With any luck, there will\nnot have to be a reader. But if it does exist,\nit\'s not going to be big. It won\'t be terribly expensive. But there will be a bunch of\nreadings online to download, and it will vary. In some cases, it will be\nreading the whole paper. In some cases, I\'ll\nbe suggesting you just read the abstract. In some cases, it will be to\nunderstand what\'s happening in the paper in detail. In some cases,\nthis is an example of how people in this bucket\nthink about this problem. Just read the abstract. So all of that will be\nassigned and made clear. What other stuff? There\'s going to be a huge\namount of information online. The coursework is going to\nbe set up for the class. There will be copies\nof the handouts. There will be lecture notes. Lecture notes that I have that\nwill be about five to 10 pages covering each lecture,\nwhich we\'ll get to about the middle of the course. And I suspect I will run\nout of steam by then. So they won\'t occur\nfor the second half. There will be commonly\nasked questions. There will be a Q&A. There\nwill be course logistics. Some of the slides will\nbe put up in there. Make use of that. There will be announcements\nabout time changing for office hours, and things like that. Make sure you make use of that. And people who are\nnot formally enrolled, we are figuring\nout a way for you to get access to it as well. We\'ve also made the decision\nthat after this lecture, the handouts will\nnot be on paper. And that is because\nroughly for each lecture, we will go through about\n5000 pieces of paper, even double sided. All of this stuff will get\nposted on Coursework the day before. And if that\'s going\nto make it impossible for you to follow what happens\nin class because you are the last human on Stanford\nwho was not living off of a computer screen,\ncome and talk to me. And we will slip you an actual\npaper copy of the handouts. Most of them, with\nany luck, we can avoid using paper just because\nof how many people there are in here. Let\'s see. Other stuff. Sections will start\nthis Thursday. The regular sections-- all\nof those will be posted, the times for that. Office hours won\'t\nstart until next week. The midterm will\nbe in an evening rather than during a class time. And if we are on schedule,\nthe class time that day will be used for review. And anything else? Oh, a very good suggestion\njust now given that the class before\nhere is humongous, and thus we have the\nimpossible problem of a lot of people\ntrying to get out of that while a lot of people\nare trying to get into that. It might work best for everybody\nto come in from the top so that you flow down\nthe stairs seamlessly and drive out those other people\nbefore us out the door there. That might work a\nwhole lot better. Final thing is we have\na team of TAs here. And they are great. Here they are. TAs, stand up and\nbe embarrassed. OK, stand up, guys. There they are. There is all but one of\nthem, who is in transit. There you are. These guys are great. They have either taken\nthe course before. In some cases they have\nTA\'d the course before. They are grad\nstudents in various of the bucket specialties. I would strongly suggest taking\nadvantage of the sections. What will evolve after\nthe first few weeks is there will be the regular\nsections going over the course material in the usual way. There are also being more\nadvanced sections for people who have stronger backgrounds. Take advantage. OK, you guys can sit down. Leaving them standing there\nawkwardly for hours afterward. Take advantage of the sections. Really greatly skilled TAs. OK so that\'s basically\nwhat we got going here. Are there any questions? [INAUDIBLE] Units. OK, somebody\nemailed about units. The class is five\nunits, and it\'s because we are meeting\nfor so many hours a week. Actually, for a while the\nclass was a six-unit course. And that was because\nof Condoleezza Rice. Because when she was\nthe provost here, she totally screwed\nthe biology department by upping our\nteaching requirements under really nasty conditions. So what we all decided\nwas to find ways, every single sleazy\ntrick we could do to puff up the\nnumber of units we were supposedly teaching. So for a while,\nthe five unit class here would get you six units. But eventually they caught\nus, so we stopped doing that. So first she did that, and then\nweapons of mass destruction. [LAUGHING] So it\'s a five unit\nclass at the moment. Say hi for me if you\nrun into her on campus. So five units. The workload, I think, will\nbe commensurate with that. But it\'s mainly because\nof heavy class time. One additional\nthing-- lectures are going to be taped and put\nup online with a day or so on Coursework. The reason for that is given\nthat this spans two hour block, a lot of people have to\nmiss one of the hour blocks. And in the past, it has worked\nto be able to get the stuff up online. So that will be\nadvantageous for some folks. OK. Question? Yes, there was a\nquestion up there. [INAUDIBLE] OK, you take it back. OK, any other questions? Bagel guy. Did you get your bagel,\nor did somebody eat it? [INAUDIBLE] OK, good. Good. The social contract\ncomes through. Yeah? [INAUDIBLE] What\'s that? [INAUDIBLE] Yes. I don\'t remember. [LAUGHTER] May 3rd. May 3rd for the midterm. 7:30 in the evening. It is a Monday. June 4th for the final. OK, more questions? Yeah? [INAUDIBLE] What\'s the format of the\nmidterm and the final? In an ideal world,\ngiven the whole emphasis here on no buckets,\nblah blah, et cetera, It would be long essays,\nand requirements of sonnets, and sensitive haikus\nabout the hypothalamus. But simply because\nof numbers in here, we are reduced to sort of like\nthe lowest common denominator, a lot of multiple\nchoice questions, just to make things\nsaner for the TAs. Because it is an\nunbelievable job to try to grade this\nmany papers that quickly. Broadly, intellectually,\nwhat the midterm is going to be about\nis just touching base, making sure you understand\nthe basics of each of those buckets, each\nof those disciplines. A little bit of forcing you\nto think across disciplines. What the final is going\nto be entirely about is forcing you to think\nacross the disciplines, across the buckets there. So it\'s going to be some very\ndifferent intellectual foci in there. Midterm-- have the facts down. Hopefully it won\'t be\nquite as mindless as that, but that\'s the main\nfunction of the midterm. OK, more questions? [INAUDIBLE] OK. TAs, did you guys decide to\nvideotape the catchup section? [INAUDIBLE] Audio, OK. [INAUDIBLE] OK. Other office hours, or it\'s\ngoing to be taped and put up online on Coursework. And if there\'s critical\nhandouts, visuals, those will be posted\nthere as well. Good. More questions? [INAUDIBLE] Yes. And it\'s going to be for each. It\'s going to be in advance\nof the next three lectures. [INAUDIBLE] Final is at 7:30 for two hours. [INAUDIBLE] The final? Oh, the final, the final. 5:15. [INAUDIBLE] 12:15. [LAUGHTER] Just to get that up there. 12:15. More questions?

It\'s an extremely famous map\namong cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom\nof the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe -- actually, this will go easier\nif I just put it up here -- There\'s Roscoe, and then right\nabove Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that\nis the tiny town of Agloe, New York. Agloe, New York, is very famous\nto cartographers, because it\'s a paper town. It\'s also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers -- because my map of New York\nand your map of New York are going to look very similar,\non account of the shape of New York -- often, mapmakers will insert\nfake places onto their maps, in order to protect their copyright. Because then, if my fake place\nshows up on your map, I can be well and truly sure\nthat you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials\nof the two guys who made this map, Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg, and they released this map in 1937. Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe, New York, on it,\nat the same exact intersection of two dirt roads\nin the middle of nowhere. Well, you can imagine the delight\nover at General Drafting. They immediately call\nRand McNally, and they say, ""We\'ve caught you!\nWe made Agloe, New York, up. It is a fake place. It\'s a paper town. We\'re going to sue your pants off!"" And Rand McNally says,\n""No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."" Because people kept going\nto that intersection of two dirt roads -- (Laughter) in the middle of nowhere, expecting\nthere to be a place called Agloe -- someone built a place\ncalled Agloe, New York. (Laughter) It had a gas station, a general store,\ntwo houses at its peak. (Laughter) And this is of course a completely\nirresistible metaphor to a novelist, because we would all like to believe\nthat the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world\nin which we\'re actually living, which is why my third book\nis called ""Paper Towns"". But what interests me ultimately more\nthan the medium in which this happened, is the phenomenon itself. It\'s easy enough to say that the world\nshapes our maps of the world, right? Like the overall shape of the world\nis obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot more\ninteresting is the way that the manner in which we map\nthe world changes the world. Because the world would truly be\na different place if North were down. And the world would be\na truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren\'t\non opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe\nto show it in its actual size. The world is changed\nby our maps of the world. The way that we choose -- sort of,\nour personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives. I believe that what we map\nchanges the life we lead. And I don\'t mean that in some, like,\nsecret-y Oprah\'s Angels network, like, you-can-think-your-way-\nout-of-cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don\'t\nshow you where you will go in your life, they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place\nthat isn\'t on your personal map. So I was a really terrible student\nwhen I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low 2s. And I think the reason that I was\nsuch a terrible student is that I felt like education\nwas just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over\nin order to achieve adulthood. And I didn\'t really want\nto jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely\narbitrary, so I often wouldn\'t, and then people would\nthreaten me, you know, they\'d threaten me with this\n""going on [my] permanent record,"" or ""You\'ll never get a good job."" I didn\'t want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven\nor twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up\nvery early in the morning, (Laughter) and the men who had good jobs,\none of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item\nof clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves, and then they went off to their jobs,\nwhatever they were. That\'s not a recipe for a happy life. These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,\ntwelve year-old imagination -- these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things\nthey do each morning, they can\'t possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump\nover all of these hurdles and have that be the end? That\'s a terrible end! And then, when I was in tenth grade,\nI went to this school, Indian Springs School,\na small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner,\nbecause I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism\nand engagement, and who thought that my ironic\noh-so-cool disengagement wasn\'t clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple\nand unspectacular response to very complicated\nand compelling problems. And so I started to learn,\nbecause learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets\nare bigger than other infinite sets, and I learned that iambic pentameter is\nand why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War\nwas a nationalizing conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn\'t be\nconfused with causation -- all of these things, by the way, enriched my life\non a literally daily basis. And it\'s true that I don\'t use\nmost of them for my ""job,"" but that\'s not what it\'s about for me. It\'s about cartography. What is the process of cartography? It\'s, you know, sailing\nupon some land, and thinking, ""I think I\'ll draw that bit of land,"" and then wondering, ""Maybe there\'s\nsome more land to draw."" And that\'s when learning\nreally began for me. It\'s true that I had teachers\nthat didn\'t give up on me, and I was very fortunate\nto have those teachers, because I often gave them cause to think\nthere was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning\nthat I did in high school wasn\'t about what happened\ninside the classroom, it was about what happened\noutside of the classroom. For instance, I can tell you that ""There\'s a certain Slant of light,\nWinter Afternoons -- That oppresses, like the Heft\nOf Cathedral Tunes --"" not because I memorized\nEmily Dickinson in school when I was in high school, but because there was a girl\nwhen I was in high school, and her name was Amanda,\nand I had a crush on her, and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you\nwhat opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playing\nSuper Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked in, and he said, ""How long have you been playing\nSuper Mario Kart?"" And I said, ""I don\'t know,\nlike, six hours?"" and he said, ""Do you realize that if you\'d worked\nat Baskin-Robbins those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars,\nso in some ways, you just paid thirty dollars\nto play Super Mario Kart."" And I was, like, ""I\'ll take that deal."" (Laughter) But I learned what opportunity cost is. And along the way, the map\nof my life got better. It got bigger; it contained more places. There were more things that might happen, more futures I might have. It wasn\'t a formal, organized\nlearning process, and I\'m happy to admit that. It was spotty, it was inconsistent,\nthere was a lot I didn\'t know. I might know, you know, Cantor\'s idea that some infinite sets are larger\nthan other infinite sets, but I didn\'t really understand\nthe calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost, but I didn\'t know the law\nof diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining\nlearning as cartography, instead of imagining it\nas arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit of coastline,\nand that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know\nat least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff. So, I had one learning community in high school, then I went\nto another for college, and then I went to another, when I started working\nat a magazine called ""Booklist,"" where I was an assistant, surrounded\nby astonishingly well-read people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream of doing, I promptly quit my job. (Laughter) And for the first time since high school, I found myself without a learning\ncommunity, and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many, many books\nduring this two-year period. I read books about Stalin, and books about how the Uzbek people\ncame to identify as Muslims, and I read books about\nhow to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was\ncreating my own hurdles, and then jumping over them myself,\ninstead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners,\na community of people who are engaged together\nin the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand\nand map the world around us. And then, in 2006, I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn\'t actually meet him,\njust on the Internet. Ze Frank was running, at the time,\na show called ""The Show with Ze Frank,"" and I discovered the show, and that was my way back\ninto being a community learner again. Here\'s Ze talking about Las Vegas: (Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built\nin the middle of a huge, hot desert. Almost everything here was brought\nfrom somewhere else -- the sort of rocks, the trees,\nthe waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place\nas my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert\nthat surrounds this place, so are these people. Things from all over the world have been\nrebuilt here, away from their histories, and away from the people\nthat experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made --\neven the Sphinx got a nose job. Here, there\'s no reason to feel\nlike you\'re missing anything. This New York means the same to me\nas it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context, and that\nmeans context allows for everything: Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one\nof the world\'s greatest achievements, because no one belongs here;\neveryone does. As I walked around this morning,\nI noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting\nthe sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors, which present you with an outside view\nof yourself embedded in a place, these mirrors come back empty. John Green: Makes me\nnostalgic for the days when you could see\nthe pixels in online video. (Laughter) Ze isn\'t just a great public intellectual,\nhe\'s also a brilliant community builder, and the community of people\nthat built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess\ncollaboratively, and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man\non a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich, by having one person hold a piece of bread\nat one point on the Earth, and on the exact opposite\npoint of the Earth, have another person\nholding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas,\nbut they are also ""learny"" ideas, and that was what was so exciting to me, and if you go online, you can find\ncommunities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr, and yes, you will see people\ncomplaining about calculus, but you\'ll also see people\nre-blogging those complaints, making the argument that calculus\nis interesting and beautiful, and here\'s a way in to thinking about\nthe problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit,\nand find sub-Reddits, like ""Ask a Historian"" or ""Ask Science,"" where you can ask people\nwho are in these fields a wide range of questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me, the most interesting\ncommunities of learners that are growing up on the Internet\nright now are on YouTube, and admittedly, I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways,\nthe YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at ""Minute Physics,"" a guy who\'s teaching\nthe world about physics: (Video) Let\'s cut to the chase. As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson\nis the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics\nto be discovered experimentally. But, you might ask,\nwhy was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles\nlike electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn\'t been discovered\nback then in the 1970s? Good question. There are two main reasons. First, just like the electron\nis an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle\nwhich is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn\nplays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular, the Higgs field\nhelps explain why it\'s so weak. We\'ll talk more about this\nin a later video, but even though weak nuclear theory was\nconfirmed in the 1980s, in the equations, the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled\nwith the weak force, that until now we\'ve been unable to confirm\nits actual and independent existence. JG: Or here\'s a video that I made as part of my show ""Crash Course,""\ntalking about World War I: (Video) The immediate cause was\nof course the assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb\nnationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside: It\'s worth noting that the first big war\nof the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand\nwasn\'t particularly well-liked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --\nnow that is a mustache! But even so, the assassination led Austria\nto issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some,\nbut not all, of Austria\'s demands, leading Austria to declare\nwar against Serbia. And then Russia, due to its alliance\nwith the Serbs, mobilized its army. Germany, because it had\nan alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany\nmobilized its own army, declared war on Russia,\ncemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France,\nbecause, you know, France. (Laughter) And it\'s not just physics\nand world history that people are choosing\nto learn through YouTube. Here\'s a video about abstract mathematics. (Video) So you\'re me, and you\'re\nin math class yet again, because they make you go every single day. And you\'re learning about, I don\'t know,\nthe sums of infinite series. That\'s a high school topic, right? Which is odd, because it\'s a cool topic,\nbut they somehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that\'s why they allow\ninfinite series in the curriculum. So, in a quite understandable need\nfor distraction, you\'re doodling and thinking more about what\nthe plural of ""series"" should be than about the topic at hand: ""serieses,""\n""seriese,"" ""seriesen,"" and ""serii?"" Or is it that the singular should be\nchanged: one ""serie,"" or ""serum,"" just like the singular of ""sheep""\nshould be ""shoop."" But the whole concept of things like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on\napproaches one, is useful if, say, you want to draw a line of elephants, each holding the tail of the next one: normal elephant, young elephant,\nbaby elephant, dog-sized elephant, puppy-sized elephant, all the way\ndown to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome, because you can get an infinite number\nof elephants in a line, and still have it fit across\na single notebook page. JG: And lastly, here\'s Destin,\nfrom ""Smarter Every Day,"" talking about the conservation\nof angular momentum, and, since it\'s YouTube, cats: (Video) Hey, it\'s me, Destin.\nWelcome back to ""Smarter Every Day."" So you\'ve probably observed that cats\nalmost always land on their feet. Today\'s question is: why? Like most simple questions,\nthere\'s a very complex answer. For instance, let me reword this question: How does a cat go from feet-up\nto feet-down in a falling reference frame, without violating the conservation\nof angular momentum? (Laughter) JG: So, here\'s something all four\nof these videos have in common: They all have more than half\na million views on YouTube. And those are people watching\nnot in classrooms, but because they are part\nof the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube\nis like a classroom to me, and in many ways it is,\nbecause here is the instructor -- it\'s like the old-fashioned classroom:\nhere\'s the instructor, and then beneath the instructor\nare the students, and they\'re all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments\nhave a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, if you go on comments\nfor these channels, what you\'ll find is people engaging\nthe subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions\nthat are about the subject matter, and then other people\nanswering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so\nthat the page in which I\'m talking to you is on the exact -- the place where I\'m\ntalking to you is on the exact same page as your comments, you are participating in a live and real\nand active way in the conversation. And because I\'m in comments usually,\nI get to participate with you. And you find this\nwhether it\'s world history, or mathematics, or science,\nor whatever it is. You also see young people using the tools\nand the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places\nfor intellectual engagement, instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes\nand other Internet conventions -- you know, ""Got bored. Invented calculus."" Or, here\'s Honey Boo Boo\ncriticizing industrial capitalism: [""Liberal capitalism is not at all\nthe Good of humanity. Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle\nof savage, destructive nihilism.""] In case you can\'t see\nwhat she says ... yeah. I really believe that these spaces, these communities, have become\nfor a new generation of learners, the kind of communities,\nthe kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school,\nand then again when I was in college. And as an adult, re-finding\nthese communities has re-introduced me\nto a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue\nto be a learner even in my adulthood, so that I no longer feel like learning\nis something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and ""Minute Physics"" introduced me to all kinds of things\nthat I didn\'t know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon\nin the Enlightenment, or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish, ""Oh, I wish I could have been\na part of that, I wish I could have laughed\nat Dorothy Parker\'s jokes."" But I\'m here to tell you that these places\nexist, they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet,\nwhere old men fear to tread. (Laughter) And I truly, truly believe that when\nwe invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real,\nwe were just getting started. Thank you.

115,0,How to escape education's death valley | Sir Ken Robinson,"Sir Ken Robinson outlines 3 principles crucial for the human mind to flourish -- and how current education culture works against them.

I moved to America 12 years ago\nwith my wife Terry and our two kids. Actually, truthfully, we moved\nto Los Angeles -- (Laughter) thinking we were moving\nto America, but anyway -- (Laughter) It\'s a short plane ride\nfrom Los Angeles to America. (Laughter) I got here 12 years ago, and when I got here,\nI was told various things, like, ""Americans don\'t get irony."" (Laughter) Have you come across this idea? It\'s not true. I\'ve traveled the whole length\nand breadth of this country. I have found no evidence\nthat Americans don\'t get irony. It\'s one of those cultural myths, like, ""The British are reserved."" (Laughter) I don\'t know why people think this. We\'ve invaded every country\nwe\'ve encountered. (Laughter) But it\'s not true Americans\ndon\'t get irony, but I just want you to know\nthat that\'s what people are saying about you behind your back. You know, so when you leave\nliving rooms in Europe, people say, thankfully,\nnobody was ironic in your presence. (Laughter) But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation,\n""No Child Left Behind."" (Laughter) Because whoever thought\nof that title gets irony. (Laughter) Don\'t they? (Applause) Because it\'s leaving\nmillions of children behind. Now I can see that\'s not a very attractive\nname for legislation: ""Millions of Children Left Behind."" I can see that. What\'s the plan? We propose to leave\nmillions of children behind, and here\'s how it\'s going to work. And it\'s working beautifully. (Laughter) In some parts of the country, 60 percent of kids drop out\nof high school. In the Native American communities, it\'s 80 percent of kids. If we halved that number, one estimate is it would create\na net gain to the U.S. economy over 10 years,\nof nearly a trillion dollars. From an economic point of view, this is good math, isn\'t it,\nthat we should do this? It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage\nfrom the dropout crisis. But the dropout crisis\nis just the tip of an iceberg. What it doesn\'t count\nare all the kids who are in school but being disengaged\nfrom it, who don\'t enjoy it, who don\'t get any real benefit from it. And the reason is not\nthat we\'re not spending enough money. America spends more money on education\nthan most other countries. Class sizes are smaller\nthan in many countries. And there are hundreds\nof initiatives every year to try and improve education. The trouble is, it\'s all going\nin the wrong direction. There are three principles\non which human life flourishes, and they are contradicted\nby the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure. The first is this, that human beings\nare naturally different and diverse. Can I ask you, how many of you\nhave got children of your own? Okay. Or grandchildren. How about two children or more? Right. And the rest of you\nhave seen such children. (Laughter) Small people wandering about. (Laughter) I will make you a bet, and I am confident\nthat I will win the bet. If you\'ve got two children or more, I bet you they are completely\ndifferent from each other. Aren\'t they? (Applause) You would never confuse them, would you? Like, ""Which one are you? Remind me."" (Laughter) ""Your mother and I need\nsome color-coding system so we don\'t get confused."" Education under ""No Child Left Behind"" is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged\nto do is to find out what kids can do across\na very narrow spectrum of achievement. One of the effects\nof ""No Child Left Behind"" has been to narrow the focus\nonto the so-called STEM disciplines. They\'re very important. I\'m not here to argue\nagainst science and math. On the contrary, they\'re necessary\nbut they\'re not sufficient. A real education has to give equal weight to the arts, the humanities,\nto physical education. An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you -- (Applause) One estimate in America currently\nis that something like 10 percent of kids, getting on that way, are being diagnosed\nwith various conditions under the broad title\nof attention deficit disorder. ADHD. I\'m not saying there\'s no such thing. I just don\'t believe\nit\'s an epidemic like this. If you sit kids down, hour after hour, doing low-grade clerical work, don\'t be surprised if they start\nto fidget, you know? (Laughter) (Applause) Children are not, for the most part,\nsuffering from a psychological condition. They\'re suffering from childhood. (Laughter) And I know this because\nI spent my early life as a child. I went through the whole thing. Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum\nthat celebrates their various talents, not just a small range of them. And by the way, the arts\naren\'t just important because they improve math scores. They\'re important because they speak\nto parts of children\'s being which are otherwise untouched. The second, thank you -- (Applause) The second principle\nthat drives human life flourishing is curiosity. If you can light the spark\nof curiosity in a child, they will learn without any further\nassistance, very often. Children are natural learners. It\'s a real achievement\nto put that particular ability out, or to stifle it. Curiosity is the engine of achievement. Now the reason I say this is because one of the effects\nof the current culture here, if I can say so, has been to de-professionalize teachers. There is no system in the world\nor any school in the country that is better than its teachers. Teachers are the lifeblood\nof the success of schools. But teaching is a creative profession. Teaching, properly conceived,\nis not a delivery system. You know, you\'re not there just\nto pass on received information. Great teachers do that, but what great teachers also do is mentor, stimulate, provoke, engage. You see, in the end,\neducation is about learning. If there\'s no learning going on,\nthere\'s no education going on. And people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education\nwithout ever discussing learning. The whole point of education\nis to get people to learn. An old friend of mine --\nactually very old, he\'s dead. (Laughter) That\'s as old as it gets, I\'m afraid. (Laughter) But a wonderful guy he was,\nwonderful philosopher. He used to talk about the difference between the task\nand achievement senses of verbs. You can be engaged\nin the activity of something, but not really be\nachieving it, like dieting. (Laughter) It\'s a very good example. There he is. He\'s dieting. Is he losing any weight? Not really. (Laughter) Teaching is a word like that. You can say, ""There\'s Deborah,\nshe\'s in room 34, she\'s teaching."" But if nobody\'s learning anything, she may be engaged in the task of teaching\nbut not actually fulfilling it. The role of a teacher\nis to facilitate learning. That\'s it. And part of the problem is, I think, that the dominant culture\nof education has come to focus on not teaching and learning, but testing. Now, testing is important. Standardized tests have a place. But they should not be\nthe dominant culture of education. They should be diagnostic.\nThey should help. (Applause) If I go for a medical examination,\nI want some standardized tests. I do. I want to know\nwhat my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else\'s\non a standard scale. I don\'t want to be told on some scale\nmy doctor invented in the car. (Laughter) ""Your cholesterol\nis what I call Level Orange."" ""Really?"" (Laughter) ""Is that good?"" ""We don\'t know."" (Laughter) But all that should support learning. It shouldn\'t obstruct it,\nwhich of course it often does. So in place of curiosity,\nwhat we have is a culture of compliance. Our children and teachers are encouraged\nto follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power\nof imagination and curiosity. And the third principle is this:\nthat human life is inherently creative. It\'s why we all have different résumés. We create our lives, and we can recreate them\nas we go through them. It\'s the common currency\nof being a human being. It\'s why human culture\nis so interesting and diverse and dynamic. I mean, other animals may well have\nimaginations and creativity, but it\'s not so much\nin evidence, is it, as ours? I mean, you may have a dog. And your dog may get depressed. You know, but it doesn\'t listen\nto Radiohead, does it? (Laughter) And sit staring out the window\nwith a bottle of Jack Daniels. (Laughter) ""Would you like to come for a walk?"" ""No, I\'m fine."" (Laughter) ""You go. I\'ll wait. But take pictures."" (Laughter) We all create our own lives\nthrough this restless process of imagining alternatives\nand possibilities, and one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop\nthese powers of creativity. Instead, what we have\nis a culture of standardization. Now, it doesn\'t have to be that way. It really doesn\'t. Finland regularly comes out on top\nin math, science and reading. Now, we only know\nthat\'s what they do well at, because that\'s all that\'s being tested. That\'s one of the problems of the test. They don\'t look for other things\nthat matter just as much. The thing about work in Finland is this: they don\'t obsess about those disciplines. They have a very broad\napproach to education, which includes humanities,\nphysical education, the arts. Second, there is no standardized\ntesting in Finland. I mean, there\'s a bit, but it\'s not what gets\npeople up in the morning, what keeps them at their desks. The third thing --\nand I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland,\nactual Finnish people, and somebody from the American system\nwas saying to the people in Finland, ""What do you do\nabout the drop-out rate in Finland?"" And they all looked a bit\nbemused, and said, ""Well, we don\'t have one. Why would you drop out? If people are in trouble,\nwe get to them quite quickly and we help and support them."" Now people always say, ""Well, you know, you can\'t compare\nFinland to America."" No. I think there\'s a population\nof around five million in Finland. But you can compare it\nto a state in America. Many states in America\nhave fewer people in them than that. I mean, I\'ve been\nto some states in America and I was the only person there. (Laughter) Really. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left. (Laughter) But what all the high-performing\nsystems in the world do is currently what is not evident, sadly, across the systems in America -- I mean, as a whole. One is this: they individualize teaching and learning. They recognize that it\'s students\nwho are learning and the system has to engage them, their curiosity, their individuality,\nand their creativity. That\'s how you get them to learn. The second is that they attribute\na very high status to the teaching profession. They recognize\nthat you can\'t improve education if you don\'t pick great people to teach\nand keep giving them constant support\nand professional development. Investing in professional\ndevelopment is not a cost. It\'s an investment, and every other country\nthat\'s succeeding well knows that, whether it\'s Australia, Canada, South Korea, Singapore,\nHong Kong or Shanghai. They know that to be the case. And the third is, they devolve responsibility\nto the school level for getting the job done. You see, there\'s a big difference here between going into a mode of command\nand control in education -- That\'s what happens in some systems. Central or state governments decide, they know best and they\'re going\nto tell you what to do. The trouble is that education\ndoesn\'t go on in the committee rooms\nof our legislative buildings. It happens in classrooms and schools, and the people who do it\nare the teachers and the students, and if you remove their discretion,\nit stops working. You have to put it back to the people. (Applause) There is wonderful work\nhappening in this country. But I have to say it\'s happening in spite of the dominant\nculture of education, not because of it. It\'s like people are sailing\ninto a headwind all the time. And the reason I think is this: that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic\nconceptions of education. It\'s like education\nis an industrial process that can be improved\njust by having better data, and somewhere in the back of the mind\nof some policy makers is this idea that if we fine-tune it\nwell enough, if we just get it right, it will all hum along perfectly\ninto the future. It won\'t, and it never did. The point is that education\nis not a mechanical system. It\'s a human system. It\'s about people, people who either do want\nto learn or don\'t want to learn. Every student who drops\nout of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography. They may find it boring. They may find it irrelevant. They may find that it\'s at odds with\nthe life they\'re living outside of school. There are trends,\nbut the stories are always unique. I was at a meeting recently\nin Los Angeles of -- they\'re called alternative\neducation programs. These are programs designed\nto get kids back into education. They have certain common features. They\'re very personalized. They have strong support for the teachers, close links with the community\nand a broad and diverse curriculum, and often programs which involve students\noutside school as well as inside school. And they work. What\'s interesting to me is,\nthese are called ""alternative education."" (Laughter) You know? And all the evidence\nfrom around the world is, if we all did that, there\'d be\nno need for the alternative. (Applause) (Applause ends) So I think we have to embrace\na different metaphor. We have to recognize\nthat it\'s a human system, and there are conditions\nunder which people thrive, and conditions under which they don\'t. We are after all organic creatures, and the culture of the school\nis absolutely essential. Culture is an organic term, isn\'t it? Not far from where I live\nis a place called Death Valley. Death Valley is the hottest,\ndriest place in America, and nothing grows there. Nothing grows there\nbecause it doesn\'t rain. Hence, Death Valley. In the winter of 2004,\nit rained in Death Valley. Seven inches of rain fell\nover a very short period. And in the spring of 2005,\nthere was a phenomenon. The whole floor of Death Valley\nwas carpeted in flowers for a while. What it proved is this: that Death Valley isn\'t dead. It\'s dormant. Right beneath the surface\nare these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions\nto come about, and with organic systems,\nif the conditions are right, life is inevitable. It happens all the time. You take an area, a school, a district, you change the conditions, give people\na different sense of possibility, a different set of expectations,\na broader range of opportunities, you cherish and value the relationships\nbetween teachers and learners, you offer people\nthe discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do, and schools that were once\nbereft spring to life. Great leaders know that. The real role of leadership\nin education -- and I think it\'s true\nat the national level, the state level, at the school level -- is not and should not be\ncommand and control. The real role of leadership\nis climate control, creating a climate of possibility. And if you do that, people will rise to it and achieve things\nthat you completely did not anticipate and couldn\'t have expected. There\'s a wonderful quote\nfrom Benjamin Franklin. ""There are three sorts\nof people in the world: Those who are immovable, people who don\'t get it, or don\'t want to do anything about it; there are people who are movable, people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it; and there are people who move, people who make things happen."" And if we can encourage more people,\nthat will be a movement. And if the movement is strong enough, that\'s, in the best sense\nof the word, a revolution. And that\'s what we need. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you very much.

Today, I have come\nto share the secrets of our success, because rich capitalists like me\nhave never been richer. So the question is, how do we do it? How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share\nof the economic pie every year? Is it that rich people are smarter\nthan we were 30 years ago? Is it that we\'re working harder\nthan we once did? Are we taller, better looking? Sadly, no. It all comes down to just one thing: economics. Because, here\'s the dirty secret. There was a time\nin which the economics profession worked in the public interest, but in the neoliberal era, today, they work only for big corporations and billionaires, and that is creating\na little bit of a problem. We could choose to enact economic policies that raise taxes on the rich, regulate powerful corporations\nor raise wages for workers. We have done it before. But neoliberal economists would warn that all of these policies\nwould be a terrible mistake, because raising taxes\nalways kills economic growth, and any form of government regulation is inefficient, and raising wages always kills jobs. Well, as a consequence of that thinking, over the last 30 years, in the USA alone, the top one percent has grown\n21 trillion dollars richer while the bottom 50 percent\nhave grown 900 billion dollars poorer, a pattern of widening inequality\nthat has largely repeated itself across the world. And yet, as middle class families\nstruggle to get by on wages that have not budged\nin about 40 years, neoliberal economists continue to warn\nthat the only reasonable response to the painful dislocations\nof austerity and globalization is even more austerity and globalization. So, what is a society to do? Well, it\'s super clear to me\nwhat we need to do. We need a new economics. So, economics has been described\nas the dismal science, and for good reason,\nbecause as much as it is taught today, it isn\'t a science at all, in spite of all\nof the dazzling mathematics. In fact, a growing number\nof academics and practitioners have concluded that neoliberal\neconomic theory is dangerously wrong and that today\'s growing crises\nof rising inequality and growing political instability are the direct result\nof decades of bad economic theory. What we now know is that the economics\nthat made me so rich isn\'t just wrong, it\'s backwards, because it turns out it isn\'t capital\nthat creates economic growth, it\'s people; and it isn\'t self-interest\nthat promotes the public good, it\'s reciprocity; and it isn\'t competition\nthat produces our prosperity, it\'s cooperation. What we can now see is that an economics\nthat is neither just nor inclusive can never sustain the high levels\nof social cooperation necessary to enable\na modern society to thrive. So where did we go wrong? Well, it turns out\nthat it\'s become painfully obvious that the fundamental assumptions\nthat undergird neoliberal economic theory are just objectively false, and so today first I want to take you\nthrough some of those mistaken assumptions and then after describe where the science\nsuggests prosperity actually comes from. So, neoliberal economic\nassumption number one is that the market is\nan efficient equilibrium system, which basically means that if one thing\nin the economy, like wages, goes up, another thing in the economy,\nlike jobs, must go down. So for example, in Seattle, where I live, when in 2014 we passed\nour nation\'s first 15 dollar minimum wage, the neoliberals freaked out\nover their precious equilibrium. ""If you raise the price\nof labor,"" they warned, ""businesses will purchase less of it. Thousands of low-wage workers\nwill lose their jobs. The restaurants will close."" Except ... they didn\'t. The unemployment rate fell dramatically. The restaurant business in Seattle boomed. Why? Because there is no equilibrium. Because raising wages\ndoesn\'t kill jobs, it creates them; because, for instance, when restaurant owners are suddenly\nrequired to pay restaurant workers enough so that now even they\ncan afford to eat in restaurants, it doesn\'t shrink the restaurant business, it grows it, obviously. (Applause) Thank you. The second assumption is that the price of something\nis always equal to its value, which basically means\nthat if you earn 50,000 dollars a year and I earn 50 million dollars a year, that\'s because I produce\na thousand times as much value as you. Now, it will not surprise you to learn that this is a very comforting assumption if you\'re a CEO paying yourself\n50 million dollars a year but paying your workers poverty wages. But please, take it from somebody\nwho has run dozens of businesses: this is nonsense. People are not paid what they are worth. They are paid what they have\nthe power to negotiate, and wages\' falling share of GDP is not because workers\nhave become less productive but because employers\nhave become more powerful. And -- (Applause) And by pretending that the giant imbalance\nin power between capital and labor doesn\'t exist, neoliberal economic theory\nbecame essentially a protection racket for the rich. The third assumption,\nand by far the most pernicious, is a behavioral model that describes human beings\nas something called ""homo economicus,"" which basically means\nthat we are all perfectly selfish, perfectly rational\nand relentlessly self-maximizing. But just ask yourselves, is it plausible that every single time\nfor your entire life, when you did something\nnice for somebody else, all you were doing\nwas maximizing your own utility? Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps\non a grenade to defend fellow soldiers, they\'re just promoting\ntheir narrow self-interest? If you think that\'s nuts, contrary to any reasonable\nmoral intuition, that\'s because it is and, according to the latest science, not true. But it is this behavioral model which is at the cold, cruel heart\nof neoliberal economics, and it is as morally corrosive as it is scientifically wrong because, if we accept at face value that humans are fundamentally selfish, and then we look around the world at all of the unambiguous\nprosperity in it, then it follows logically, then it must be true by definition, that billions of individual\nacts of selfishness magically transubstantiate\ninto prosperity and the common good. If we humans are merely\nselfish maximizers, then selfishness\nis the cause of our prosperity. Under this economic logic, greed is good, widening inequality is efficient, and the only purpose of the corporation can be to enrich shareholders, because to do otherwise\nwould be to slow economic growth and harm the economy overall. And it is this gospel of selfishness which forms the ideological cornerstone\nof neoliberal economics, a way of thinking\nwhich has produced economic policies which have enabled me and my rich buddies\nin the top one percent to grab virtually all of the benefits\nof growth over the last 40 years. But, if instead we accept the latest empirical research, real science, which correctly\ndescribes human beings as highly cooperative, reciprocal and intuitively moral creatures, then it follows logically that it must be cooperation and not selfishness that is the cause of our prosperity, and it isn\'t our self-interest but rather our inherent reciprocity that is humanity\'s economic superpower. So at the heart of this new economics is a story about ourselves that grants us\npermission to be our best selves, and, unlike the old economics, this is a story that is virtuous and also has the virtue of being true. Now, I want to emphasize\nthat this new economics is not something I have personally\nimagined or invented. Its theories and models\nare being developed and refined in universities around the world building on some of the best\nnew research in economics, complexity theory, evolutionary theory, psychology, anthropology\nand other disciplines. And although this new economics\ndoes not yet have its own textbook or even a commonly agreed upon name, in broad strokes its explanation of where prosperity\ncomes from goes something like this. So, market capitalism\nis an evolutionary system in which prosperity emerges through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation\nand increasing amounts of consumer demand. Innovation is the process\nby which we solve human problems, consumer demand is the mechanism\nthrough which the market selects for useful innovations, and as we solve more problems,\nwe become more prosperous. But as we become more prosperous, our problems and solutions become more complex, and this increasing technical complexity requires ever higher levels\nof social and economic cooperation in order to produce\nthe more highly specialized products that define a modern economy. Now, the old economics\nis correct, of course, that competition plays a crucial role\nin how markets work, but what it fails to see is that it is largely a competition\nbetween highly cooperative groups -- competition between firms,\ncompetition between networks of firms, competition between nations -- and anyone who has ever run\na successful business knows that building a cooperative team\nby including the talents of everyone is almost always a better strategy\nthan just a bunch of selfish jerks. So how do we leave neoliberalism behind and build a more sustainable,\nmore prosperous and more equitable society? The new economics suggests\njust five rules of thumb. First is that successful economies\nare not jungles, they\'re gardens, which is to say that markets, like gardens, must be tended, that the market is the greatest\nsocial technology ever invented for solving human problems, but unconstrained by social norms\nor democratic regulation, markets inevitably create\nmore problems than they solve. Climate change, the great financial crisis of 2008 are two easy examples. The second rule is that inclusion creates economic growth. So the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury to be afforded if and when we have growth\nis both wrong and backwards. The economy is people. Including more people in more ways is what causes economic growth\nin market economies. The third principle is the purpose of the corporation\nis not merely to enrich shareholders. The greatest grift\nin contemporary economic life is the neoliberal idea that\nthe only purpose of the corporation and the only responsibility of executives is to enrich themselves and shareholders. The new economics must and can insist that the purpose of the corporation is to improve the welfare\nof all stakeholders: customers, workers, community and shareholders alike. Rule four: greed is not good. Being rapacious\ndoesn\'t make you a capitalist, it makes you a sociopath. (Laughter) (Applause) And in an economy as dependent\nupon cooperation at scale as ours, sociopathy is as bad for business\nas it is for society. And fifth and finally, unlike the laws of physics, the laws of economics are a choice. Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you\nas unchangeable natural law, when in fact it\'s social norms\nand constructed narratives based on pseudoscience. If we truly want a more equitable, more prosperous\nand more sustainable economy, if we want high-functioning democracies and civil society, we must have a new economics. And here\'s the good news: if we want a new economics, all we have to do is choose to have it. Thank you. (Applause) Moderator: So Nick,\nI\'m sure you get this question a lot. If you\'re so unhappy\nwith the economic system, why not just give all your money away\nand join the 99 percent? Nick Hanauer: Yeah, no, yes, right. You get that a lot. You get that a lot. ""If you care so much about taxes,\nwhy don\'t you pay more, and if you care so much about wages,\nwhy don\'t you pay more?"" And I could do that. The problem is, it doesn\'t make that much difference, and I have discovered a strategy that works literally\na hundred thousand times better -- Moderator: OK. NH: which is to use my money\nto build narratives and to pass laws that will require\nall the other rich people to pay taxes and pay their workers better. (Applause) And so, for example, the 15-dollar minimum wage\nthat we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers. So that works better. Moderator: That\'s great. If you change your mind,\nwe\'ll find some takers for you. NH: OK. Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you very much.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I was just a little kid,\nso I didn\'t really understand why, but as I got older, I realized we had\ndrug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction. I\'d been thinking about it a lot lately,\npartly because it\'s now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned\nin the United States and Britain, and we then imposed that\non the rest of the world. It\'s a century since we made\nthis really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them\nand make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them;\nit would give them an incentive to stop. And a few years ago, I was looking at\nsome of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out\nif there was some way to help them. And I realized there were loads\nof incredibly basic questions I just didn\'t know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach\nthat doesn\'t seem to be working, and is there a better way out there\nthat we could try instead? So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn\'t really find\nthe answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I\'ll go and sit\nwith different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see\nif I could learn from them. And I didn\'t realize I would end up\ngoing over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up going and meeting\nloads of different people, from a transgender crack dealer\nin Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot of time\nfeeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do, but only\nin very specific circumstances -- to the only country that\'s ever\ndecriminalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal. And the thing I realized\nthat really blew my mind is, almost everything we think\nwe know about addiction is wrong, and if we start to absorb\nthe new evidence about addiction, I think we\'re going to have to change\na lot more than our drug policies. But let\'s start with what we think\nwe know, what I thought I knew. Let\'s think about this middle row here. Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went\noff and used heroin three times a day. Some of you look a little more\nenthusiastic than others at this prospect. (Laughter) Don\'t worry,\nit\'s just a thought experiment. Imagine you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what would\nhappen that we\'ve been told for a century. We think, because there are\nchemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become\ndependent on those hooks, you\'d start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days,\nyou\'d all be heroin addicts. Right? That\'s what I thought. First thing that alerted me to the fact\nthat something\'s not right with this story is when it was explained to me. If I step out of this TED Talk today\nand I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I\'ll be taken to hospital\nand I\'ll be given loads of diamorphine. Diamorphine is heroin. It\'s actually much better heroin\nthan you\'re going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy\nfrom a drug dealer is contaminated. Actually, very little of it is heroin, whereas the stuff you get\nfrom the doctor is medically pure. And you\'ll be given it for quite\na long period of time. There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it,\nyou\'ve taken quite a lot of heroin. And anyone who is watching this\nanywhere in the world, this is happening. And if what we believe\nabout addiction is right -- those people are exposed\nto all those chemical hooks -- What should happen?\nThey should become addicts. This has been studied really carefully. It doesn\'t happen; you will have noticed\nif your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn\'t come out as a junkie.\n(Laughter) And when I learned this,\nit seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I\'d been told,\neverything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn\'t be right,\nuntil I met a man called Bruce Alexander. He\'s a professor\nof psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us\nto understand this issue. Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we\'ve all\ngot in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier\nin the 20th century. They\'re really simple. You can do them tonight at home\nif you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat and you put it in a cage,\nand you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water\nlaced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always\nprefer the drug water and almost always\nkill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right?\nThat\'s how we think it works. In the \'70s, Professor Alexander comes\nalong and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something. He said ah, we\'re putting\nthe rat in an empty cage. It\'s got nothing to do\nexcept use these drugs. Let\'s try something different. So Professor Alexander built a cage\nthat he called ""Rat Park,"" which is basically heaven for rats. They\'ve got loads of cheese,\nthey\'ve got loads of colored balls, they\'ve got loads of tunnels. Crucially, they\'ve got loads of friends.\nThey can have loads of sex. And they\'ve got both the water bottles,\nthe normal water and the drugged water. But here\'s the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don\'t\nlike the drug water. They almost never use it. None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose\nwhen they\'re isolated to zero percent overdose when they\nhave happy and connected lives. Now, when he first saw this,\nProfessor Alexander thought, maybe this is just a thing about rats,\nthey\'re quite different to us. Maybe not as different as we\'d like,\nbut, you know -- But fortunately, there was\na human experiment into the exact same principle happening\nat the exact same time. It was called the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American\ntroops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the news\nreports from the time, they were really worried, because\nthey thought, my God, we\'re going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies\non the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense. Now, those soldiers who were using\nloads of heroin were followed home. The Archives of General Psychiatry\ndid a really detailed study, and what happened to them? It turns out they didn\'t go to rehab.\nThey didn\'t go into withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of them just stopped. Now, if you believe the story\nabout chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense,\nbut Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different\nstory about addiction. He said, what if addiction isn\'t\nabout your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptation\nto your environment? Looking at this, there was another professor\ncalled Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said, maybe we shouldn\'t\neven call it addiction. Maybe we should call it bonding. Human beings have a natural\nand innate need to bond, and when we\'re happy and healthy,\nwe\'ll bond and connect with each other, but if you can\'t do that, because you\'re traumatized or isolated\nor beaten down by life, you will bond with something\nthat will give you some sense of relief. Now, that might be gambling,\nthat might be pornography, that might be cocaine,\nthat might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect\nwith something because that\'s our nature. That\'s what we want as human beings. And at first, I found this quite\na difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped me\nto think about it is, I can see, I\'ve got over by my seat\na bottle of water, right? I\'m looking at lots of you, and lots\nof you have bottles of water with you. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war. Totally legally, all of those bottles\nof water could be bottles of vodka, right? We could all be getting drunk --\nI might after this -- (Laughter) -- but we\'re not. Now, because you\'ve been able to afford\nthe approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk,\nI\'m guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka\nfor the next six months. You wouldn\'t end up homeless. You\'re not going to do that,\nand the reason you\'re not going to do that is not because anyone\'s stopping you. It\'s because you\'ve got\nbonds and connections that you want to be present for. You\'ve got work you love.\nYou\'ve got people you love. You\'ve got healthy relationships. And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe\nthe evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear\nto be present in your life. Now, this has really\nsignificant implications. The most obvious implications\nare for the War on Drugs. In Arizona, I went out\nwith a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts\nsaying, ""I was a drug addict,"" and go out on chain gangs and dig graves\nwhile members of the public jeer at them, and when those women get out of prison,\nthey\'re going to have criminal records that mean they\'ll never work\nin the legal economy again. Now, that\'s a very extreme example,\nobviously, in the case of the chain gang, but actually almost\neverywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that. We punish them. We shame them.\nWe give them criminal records. We put barriers between them reconnecting. There was a doctor in Canada,\nDr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man, who said to me, if you wanted to design\na system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system. Now, there\'s a place that decided\nto do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked. In the year 2000, Portugal had\none of the worst drug problems in Europe. One percent of the population was addicted\nto heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing, and every year, they tried\nthe American way more and more. They punished people and stigmatized them\nand shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse. And one day, the Prime Minister and\nthe leader of the opposition got together, and basically said, look, we can\'t go on with a country where we\'re having\never more people becoming heroin addicts. Let\'s set up a panel\nof scientists and doctors to figure out what would\ngenuinely solve the problem. And they set up a panel led by\nan amazing man called Dr. João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence, and they came back and they said, ""Decriminalize all drugs\nfrom cannabis to crack, but"" -- and this is the crucial next step -- ""take all the money we used to spend\non cutting addicts off, on disconnecting them, and spend it instead\non reconnecting them with society."" And that\'s not really what we think of\nas drug treatment in the United States and Britain. So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy,\nthat does have some value. But the biggest thing they did\nwas the complete opposite of what we do: a massive program\nof job creation for addicts, and microloans for addicts\nto set up small businesses. So say you used to be a mechanic. When you\'re ready, they\'ll go\nto a garage, and they\'ll say, if you employ this guy for a year,\nwe\'ll pay half his wages. The goal was to make sure\nthat every addict in Portugal had something to get out\nof bed for in the morning. And when I went and met the addicts\nin Portugal, what they said is,\nas they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds\nand relationships with the wider society. It\'ll be 15 years this year\nsince that experiment began, and the results are in: injecting drug use is down in Portugal, according to the British\nJournal of Criminology, by 50 percent, five-zero percent. Overdose is massively down,\nHIV is massively down among addicts. Addiction in every study\nis significantly down. One of the ways you know it\'s worked\nso well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system. Now, that\'s the political implications. I actually think there\'s a layer\nof implications to all this research below that. We live in a culture where people\nfeel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions,\nwhether it\'s to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating. Before these talks began --\nyou guys know this -- we were told we weren\'t allowed\nto have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you\nlooked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer\nwas going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours. (Laughter) A lot of us feel like that,\nand it might sound weird to say, I\'ve been talking about how disconnection\nis a major driver of addiction and weird to say it\'s growing, because you think we\'re the most connected\nsociety that\'s ever been, surely. But I increasingly began to think\nthat the connections we have or think we have, are like a kind\nof parody of human connection. If you have a crisis in your life,\nyou\'ll notice something. It won\'t be your Twitter followers\nwho come to sit with you. It won\'t be your Facebook friends\nwho help you turn it round. It\'ll be your flesh and blood friends\nwho you have deep and nuanced and textured, face-to-face\nrelationships with, and there\'s a study I learned about from\nBill McKibben, the environmental writer, that I think tells us a lot about this. It looked at the number of close friends\nthe average American believes they can call on in a crisis. That number has been declining\nsteadily since the 1950s. The amount of floor space\nan individual has in their home has been steadily increasing, and I think that\'s like a metaphor for the choice we\'ve made as a culture. We\'ve traded floorspace for friends,\nwe\'ve traded stuff for connections, and the result is we are one of the\nloneliest societies there has ever been. And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did\nthe Rat Park experiment, says, we talk all the time in addiction\nabout individual recovery, and it\'s right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more\nabout social recovery. Something\'s gone wrong with us,\nnot just with individuals but as a group, and we\'ve created a society where,\nfor a lot of us, life looks a whole lot more\nlike that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park. If I\'m honest, this isn\'t\nwhy I went into it. I didn\'t go in to the discover\nthe political stuff, the social stuff. I wanted to know how to help\nthe people I love. And when I came back from this\nlong journey and I\'d learned all this, I looked at the addicts in my life, and if you\'re really candid,\nit\'s hard loving an addict, and there\'s going to be lots of people\nwho know in this room. You are angry a lot of the time, and I think one of the reasons\nwhy this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart\nof each of us, right? Everyone has a bit of them\nthat looks at an addict and thinks, I wish someone would just stop you. And the kind of scripts we\'re told for how\nto deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by, I think, the reality show ""Intervention,""\nif you guys have ever seen it. I think everything in our lives\nis defined by reality TV, but that\'s another TED Talk. If you\'ve ever seen\nthe show ""Intervention,"" it\'s a pretty simple premise. Get an addict, all the people\nin their life, gather them together, confront them with what they\'re doing,\nand they say, if you don\'t shape up, we\'re going to cut you off. So what they do is they take\nthe connection to the addict, and they threaten it,\nthey make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want. And I began to think, I began to see\nwhy that approach doesn\'t work, and I began to think that\'s almost like\nthe importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives. So I was thinking,\nhow could I be Portuguese? And what I\'ve tried to do now,\nand I can\'t tell you I do it consistently and I can\'t tell you it\'s easy, is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen\nthe connection with them, to say to them, I love you\nwhether you\'re using or you\'re not. I love you, whatever state you\'re in, and if you need me,\nI\'ll come and sit with you because I love you and I don\'t\nwant you to be alone or to feel alone. And I think the core of that message -- you\'re not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level\nof how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually. For 100 years now, we\'ve been singing\nwar songs about addicts. I think all along we should have been\nsinging love songs to them, because the opposite of addiction\nis not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. Thank you.

And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is, and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn\'t made a damn bit of difference. Now, this is Bernoulli\'s gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you, it\'s because, well, it\'s Greek. But the simple English translation -- much less precise, but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this: The expected value of any of our actions -- that is, the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things: the odds that this action will allow us to gain something, and the value of that gain to us. In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is, if we can estimate and multiply these two things, we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now, this simple equation, even for those of you who don\'t like equations, is something that you\'re quite used to. Here\'s an example: if I were to tell you, let\'s play a little coin toss game, and I\'m going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I\'m going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I\'ll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five, and that\'s more than I\'m charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet. Now, the idea is simple when we\'re applying it to coin tosses, but in fact, it\'s not very simple in everyday life. People are horrible at estimating both of these things, and that\'s what I want to talk to you about today. There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do, and those are errors in estimating the odds that they\'re going to succeed, and errors in estimating the value of their own success. Now, let me talk about the first one first. Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy: there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck. You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads. But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That\'s why Americans spend more -- I should say, lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined. The reason is, this isn\'t how people do odds. The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now, the question I\'m going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford. And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you\'ve seen dogs and pigs on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeing dogs, not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind, then dogs on leashes are more probable. That\'s not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is. So, for example, here\'s a word puzzle. Are there more four-letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place? Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan, and it\'s awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung, and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly. But in fact, there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place. The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn\'t because they\'re improbable, unlikely or infrequent. It\'s because the mind recalls words by their first letter. You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes. It\'s like the dictionary; it\'s hard to look things up by the third letter. So, this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray. It\'s not just puzzles, though. For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all, two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks. Two things are vastly underestimated: dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why? When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was, ""Boy dies of Asthma?"" It\'s not interesting because it\'s so common. It\'s very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we\'ve seen tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck who\'s blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July. Drownings and asthma deaths don\'t get much coverage. They don\'t come quickly to mind, and as a result, we vastly underestimate them. Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of ""Which thing doesn\'t belong?"" And you\'re right to say it\'s the swimming pool that doesn\'t belong, because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that\'s actually very dangerous. The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide. The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case of people\'s ability to compute probabilities. And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which, by the way, doesn\'t require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery? Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size, I don\'t know. We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost? Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say, ""Me? I lost."" ""Me? I lost."" Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television -- no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss, and then at the end there\'s 30 seconds of, ""and I won,"" the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look, I can prove this to you: here\'s a little lottery. There\'s 10 tickets in this lottery. Nine of them have been sold to these individuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win, you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet? Well, Bernoulli tells us it is. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money. And most people say, ""OK, I\'ll play."" Now, a slightly different version of this lottery: imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has nine tickets; there\'s one left. Do you want it? Most people won\'t play this lottery. Now, you can see the odds of winning haven\'t changed, but it\'s now fantastically easy to imagine who\'s going to win. It\'s easy to see Leroy getting the check, right? You can\'t say to yourself, ""I\'m as likely to win as anybody,"" because you\'re not as likely to win as Leroy. The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds. Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value: trying to say what something is worth, how much we\'ll enjoy it, how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors in value. How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars? Most of you have the intuition that it\'s not -- you wouldn\'t pay that for it. But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one, and only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars? If you\'ve ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia and realized that they\'re not going to serve you any food, but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald\'s bag, and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat, you think, I can\'t do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours. I can\'t even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter! Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal. On the other hand, if you\'re visiting an underdeveloped country, and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it\'s exorbitant for a Big Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no, before I\'d even told you anything about the context? Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you\'re used to paying. Rather than asking, ""What else can I do with my money,"" comparing this investment to other possible investments, you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous. This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads. For example, this is, of course, one of the most delicious tricks in marketing, is to say something used to be higher, and suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K, a job where you\'re getting a salary cut each year, and one in which you\'re getting a salary increase, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they\'re all told they make much less money. Why? Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here\'s another nice example. Here\'s a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it\'s now on sale for 1,600. Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package? Most people say they would. Here\'s a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no. Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there\'s no way I\'m paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here\'s another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions. Imagine that you\'re going to the theater. You\'re on your way to the theater. In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars. You also have a 20-dollar bill. When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you\'ve lost the ticket. Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it? Most people answer, no. Now, let\'s just change one thing in this scenario. You\'re on your way to the theater, and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you\'ve lost one of them. Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket? Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do? Now, just in case you\'re not getting it, here\'s a schematic of what happened, OK? (Laughter) Along the way, you lost something. In both cases, it was a piece of paper. In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn\'t. What the hell difference should it make? The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself, I\'m not paying twice for the same thing. You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it\'s a bad deal. Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people\'s attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past, we still make certain kinds of mistakes. And I\'m going to show you one or two of them. One of the things we know about comparison: that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value. So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum, didn\'t seem like such a great guy. Suddenly, we\'re almost longing for him to return. (Laughter) The comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course, and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money. And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine, and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do? Most people don\'t want the most expensive, they don\'t want the least expensive. So, they will opt for the item in the middle. If you\'re a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 wine doesn\'t look as expensive in comparison. So I\'m telling you something you already knew: namely, that comparison changes the value of things. Here\'s why that\'s a problem: the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home, it won\'t matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to. The comparisons we make when we are appraising value, where we\'re trying to estimate how much we\'ll like things, are not the same comparisons we\'ll be making when we consume them. This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in. These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions: How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now? They\'re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them. For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam. In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they\'re going to enjoy the potato chips. Namely, those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty; those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won\'t be nearly so tasty. Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips? Well, look, you didn\'t need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what\'s sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience. You\'ve all experienced this yourself, even if you\'ve never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here\'s a question: You want to buy a car stereo. The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks. So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars? Most people say they would. They can\'t imagine buying it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off. Now, let\'s imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000. But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900. Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars. Most people say, no, I\'m going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car? This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should. Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! -- doesn\'t know where it came from. It doesn\'t know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn\'t go, I\'m the money saved on the car stereo, or, I\'m the dumb money saved on the car. It\'s money. And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it\'s worth 100 bucks no matter what you\'re saving it on. People don\'t think that way. That\'s why they don\'t know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment, but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste. Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons, because what you\'re doing is, you\'re comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you\'re making, but when you go to spend that money you won\'t be making that comparison. You\'ve all had this experience. If you\'re an American, for example, you\'ve probably traveled in France. And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown, and you thought, ""Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They\'re so nice to me. I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don\'t, these people are just wonderful."" And so you tour France with them, and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner, and what do you find? Compared to your regular friends, they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context, the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers -- these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers, and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them, and you bring them home, and you entirely violate the décor of your house. And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you\'ll never make again. What are the odds that years later you\'ll turn on the stereo and go, ""Sounds so much better than those little ones,"" which you can\'t even remember hearing. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem and then a third, hard, problem. Here\'s the first easy problem: You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer? This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK? All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is, we believe more is better than less. Here\'s the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer? Again, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later. What\'s hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict. For example, when you\'re offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month. This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting, but you have to be patient. What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations? Well, by and large people are enormously impatient. That is, they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars. Maybe that isn\'t so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen. Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that\'s 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months. What do we find now? People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they\'re waiting 12, they might as well wait 13. What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen? Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they\'ll be delivered in now or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year. Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results? These guys can tell us. What you see here are two lads, one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler. They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon, and I want you to notice two things. At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point. However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller. First it\'s an inch in your view, then it\'s a quarter-inch, then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth. Here are the results of what I just showed you. This is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points. And I want you to see that two things are true. One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look; and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right. At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved. As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value. These are the results of the hard problem I gave you: 60 now or 50 in a month? And these are subjective values, and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved. People always think more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50, and they always think now is better than later: the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future. Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that when people get to the future, they will change their minds. That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars? I\'ll take the 50 dollars now. Well, the question with which I\'d like to end is this: If we\'re so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon? Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people\'s inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value. The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you\'ve already heard in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again: namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups, rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves, had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today. Bernoulli\'s gift, Bernoulli\'s little formula, allows us, it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us. That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast. We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands. We have no significant predators, we\'re the masters of our physical environment; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us. The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions. If we\'re not here in 10,000 years, it\'s going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in 1738, because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: That was remarkable. We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two. Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us, and is there some way that we could counteract that? Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer. I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people\'s psychological reaction to a set of events, and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified, rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we\'re all concerned about. Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to -- and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents. We already know, for example, in the United States, more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways, than were killed in 9/11. OK? If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year, you might be alarmed if you didn\'t find out it was the flu. These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play, the kind of coverage, that they do. Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they\'ll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. CA: Dan, I\'d like to hear more on this. So, you\'re saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it\'s a form of mental bug? Talk more about it. DG: It\'s out-sized. I mean, look. If Australia disappears tomorrow, terror is probably the right response. That\'s an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand, when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country. Is terror the right response? CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it\'s so spectacular? Is it the fact that it\'s an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders? What is it? DG: Yes. It\'s a number of things, and you hit on several of them. First, it\'s a human agent trying to kill us -- it\'s not a tree falling on us by accident. Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again. People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there\'s good reason, but sometimes people think there are. So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let\'s not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there\'s a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can. CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it? DG: Well, go to Israel. You know, go to Israel. And a mall blows up, and then everybody\'s unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on. And as the Israeli mother said, she said, ""We never let them win by stopping weddings."" I mean, this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it, shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks. CA: But is there a rational fear that actually, the reason we\'re frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come? DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened. I don\'t want to say -- please, I\'m going to get quoted somewhere as saying, ""Terrorism is fine and we shouldn\'t be so distressed."" That\'s not my point at all. What I\'m saying is that, surely, rationally, our distress about things that happen, about threats, should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come. I think in the case of terrorism, it isn\'t. And many of the things we\'ve heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said, Poverty! I can\'t believe what poverty is doing to us. People get up in the morning; they don\'t care about poverty. It\'s not making headlines, it\'s not making news, it\'s not flashy. There are no guns going off. I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty? (Laughter) (Applause) That\'s a tough one. CA: There\'s no question. Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude, unless someone can show that there\'s, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come. The latest I\'ve read, seen, thought is that it\'s incredibly hard for them to do that. If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly, but with poverty it\'s a bit -- DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty. CA: We\'ve evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past, in the ancient past, we just didn\'t understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth, and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things? People died; so be it. But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened? DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. My guess is that there\'s nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you\'re looking for an evolutionary explanation, you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they\'re a little scared of stuff that\'s new and different. And there\'s a good reason to be, because old stuff didn\'t eat you. Right? Any animal you see that you\'ve seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you\'ve never seen before. So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we\'ve never seen this before, our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated. I don\'t think it\'s quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it. Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you\'re making the exact same error you\'re accusing those people of, which is the error of value. I know, because I\'ve interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning. That\'s what you think it is. All right? The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose, and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that? It\'s not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It\'s because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you\'ve lost. Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment, you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from. Now, economists tend to -- (Applause) -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses, which is: this is just a bunch of stupid people. And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people. And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is, we didn\'t listen to the economists. Thank you very much. (Applause) DG: Well, no, it\'s a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember, people who didn\'t buy tickets don\'t feel awful the next day either, even though they don\'t feel great during the drawing. I would disagree that people know they\'re not going to win. I think they think it\'s unlikely, but it could happen, which is why they prefer that to the flushing. But certainly I see your point: that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning. Now, I think there\'s many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn\'t one of them, for me, but there\'s many others. CA: Last question. Aubrey de Grey: My name\'s Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge. I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I\'m interested in doing something about it, as we\'ll all hear tomorrow. I very much resonate with what you\'re saying, because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice? (Laughter) DG: For you or for them? AdG: In persuading them. DG: Ah, for you in persuading them. Well, it\'s notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly. One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future, people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way. So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you\'re 65 is a question that\'s very different than, imagine who you\'ll be when you\'re 65: will you be living, what will you look like, how much hair will you have, who will you be living with. Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario, suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. But these are tricks around the margins. I think in general you\'re battling a very fundamental human tendency, which is to say," """"I\'m here today"," and so now is more important than later."""" CA: Dan", thank you. Members of the audience," that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

(Laughter) This is a gho. This is my national dress. This is how all men dress in Bhutan. That is how our women dress. Like our women, we men get to wear pretty bright colors, but unlike our women, we get to show off our legs. (Laughter) Our national dress is unique, but this is not the only thing\nthat\'s unique about my country. Our promise to remain\ncarbon neutral is also unique, and this is what I\'d like\nto speak about today, our promise to remain carbon neutral. But before I proceed,\nI should set you the context. I should tell you our story. Bhutan is a small country\nin the Himalayas. We\'ve been called Shangri-La, even the last Shangri-La. But let me tell you right off the bat,\nwe are not Shangri-La. My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks. (Laughter) The reality is that\nthere are barely 700,000 of us sandwiched between two\nof the most populated countries on earth, China and India. The reality is that we are a small,\nunderdeveloped country doing our best to survive. But we are doing OK. We are surviving. In fact, we are thriving, and the reason we are thriving\nis because we\'ve been blessed with extraordinary kings. Our enlightened monarchs\nhave worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancing economic growth carefully with social development,\nenvironmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework\nof good governance. We call this holistic approach\nto development ""Gross National Happiness,"" or GNH. Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously\npronounced that for Bhutan, Gross National Happiness is more important\nthan Gross National Product. (Applause) Ever since, all development in Bhutan\nis driven by GNH, a pioneering vision\nthat aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people. But that\'s easier said than done, especially when you are one\nof the smallest economies in the world. Our entire GDP is less\nthan two billion dollars. I know that some of you here\nare worth more -- (Laughter) individually than the entire economy of my country. So our economy is small, but here is where it gets interesting. Education is completely free. All citizens are guaranteed\nfree school education, and those that work hard\nare given free college education. Healthcare is also completely free. Medical consultation,\nmedical treatment, medicines: they are all provided by the state. We manage this because we use our limited\nresources very carefully, and because we stay faithful\nto the core mission of GNH, which is development with values. Our economy is small,\nand we must strengthen it. Economic growth is important, but that economic growth must not come\nfrom undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment. Today, our culture is flourishing. We continue to celebrate\nour art and architecture, food and festivals, monks and monasteries. And yes, we celebrate\nour national dress, too. This is why I can wear my gho with pride. Here\'s a fun fact: you\'re looking\nat the world\'s biggest pocket. (Laughter) It starts here, goes around the back, and comes out from inside here. In this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to iPads, office files and books. (Laughter) (Applause) But sometimes -- sometimes even precious cargo. So our culture is flourishing, but so is our environment. 72 percent of my country\nis under forest cover. Our constitution demands\nthat a minimum of 60 percent of Bhutan\'s total land\nshall remain under forest cover for all time. (Applause) Our constitution, this constitution, imposes forest cover on us. Incidentally, our king\nused this constitution to impose democracy on us. You see, we the people\ndidn\'t want democracy. We didn\'t ask for it, we didn\'t demand it, and we certainly didn\'t fight for it. Instead, our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it\nin the constitution. But he went further. He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people\nto impeach their kings, and included provisions in here\nthat require all our kings to retire at the age of 65. (Applause) Fact is, we already have\na king in retirement: our previous king, the Great Fourth, retired 10 years ago at the peak of his popularity. He was all of 51 years at that time. So as I was saying, 72 percent of our country\nis under forest cover, and all that forest is pristine. That\'s why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world, and that\'s why we are\na carbon neutral country. In a world that is threatened\nwith climate change, we are a carbon neutral country. Turns out, it\'s a big deal. Of the 200-odd countries\nin the world today, it looks like we are the only one that\'s carbon neutral. Actually, that\'s not quite accurate. Bhutan is not carbon neutral. Bhutan is carbon negative. Our entire country generates\n2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but our forests, they sequester\nmore than three times that amount, so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons\nof carbon dioxide each year. But that\'s not all. (Applause) We export most\nof the renewable electricity we generate from our fast-flowing rivers. So today, the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons\nof carbon dioxide in our neighborhood. By 2020, we\'ll be exporting\nenough electricity to offset 17 million tons\nof carbon dioxide. And if we were to harness\neven half our hydropower potential, and that\'s exactly what we are working at, the clean, green energy that we export would offset something like\n50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. That is more CO2 than what the entire city\nof New York generates in one year. So inside our country,\nwe are a net carbon sink. Outside, we are offsetting carbon. And this is important stuff. You see, the world is getting warmer, and climate change is a reality. Climate change is affecting my country. Our glaciers are melting, causing flash floods and landslides, which in turn are causing disaster\nand widespread destruction in our country. I was at that lake recently. It\'s stunning. That\'s how it looked 10 years ago, and that\'s how it looked 20 years ago. Just 20 years ago, that lake didn\'t exist. It was a solid glacier. A few years ago, a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below. That destruction\nwas caused by one glacier lake. We have 2,700 of them to contend with. The point is this: my country and my people have done nothing to contribute to global warming, but we are already bearing the brunt\nof its consequences. And for a small, poor country,\none that is landlocked and mountainous, it is very difficult. But we are not going to sit\non our hands doing nothing. We will fight climate change. That\'s why we have promised\nto remain carbon neutral. We first made this promise in 2009 during COP 15 in Copenhagen, but nobody noticed. Governments were so busy\narguing with one another and blaming each other\nfor causing climate change, that when a small country\nraised our hands and announced, ""We promise to remain\ncarbon neutral for all time,"" nobody heard us. Nobody cared. Last December in Paris, at COP 21, we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral\nfor all time to come. This time, we were heard. We were noticed, and everybody cared. What was different in Paris\nwas that governments came round together to accept the realities of climate change, and were willing to come together\nand act together and work together. All countries, from the very small\nto the very large, committed to reduce\nthe greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Framework Convention\non Climate Change says that if these so-called\nintended commitments are kept, we\'d be closer\nto containing global warming by two degrees Celsius. By the way, I\'ve requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here\nby two degrees, so if some of you\nare feeling warmer than usual, you know who to blame. It\'s crucial that all of us\nkeep our commitments. As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise\nto remain carbon neutral. Here are some of the ways we are doing it. We are providing free electricity\nto our rural farmers. The idea is that, with free electricity,\nthey will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food. We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase\nof electric vehicles. Similarly, we are subsidizing\nthe cost of LED lights, and our entire government\nis trying to go paperless. We are cleaning up our entire country\nthrough Clean Bhutan, a national program, and we are planting trees\nthroughout our country through Green Bhutan, another national program. But it is our protected areas that are at the core\nof our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sink. They are our lungs. Today, more than half\nour country is protected, as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. But the beauty is that we\'ve connected\nthem all with one another through a network of biological corridors. Now, what this means is that our animals are free\nto roam throughout our country. Take this tiger, for example. It was spotted\nat 250 meters above sea level in the hot, subtropical jungles. Two years later, that same tiger was spotted near 4,000 meters in our cold alpine mountains. Isn\'t that awesome? (Applause) We must keep it that way. We must keep our parks awesome. So every year, we set aside resources\nto prevent poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in our parks, and resources to help communities\nwho live in those parks manage their forests, adapt to climate change, and lead better lives while continuing\nto live in harmony with Mother Nature. But that is expensive. Over the next few years,\nour small economy won\'t have the resources to cover all the costs that are required\nto protect our environment. In fact, when we run the numbers, it looks like it\'ll take us\nat least 15 years before we can fully finance\nall our conservation efforts. But neither Bhutan, nor the world can afford to spend 15 years\ngoing backwards. This is why His Majesty the King started Bhutan For Life. Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need. It gives us breathing room. It is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks, to protect our parks, until our government\ncan take over on our own fully. The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors,\ncorporations and institutions, but the deal is closed only\nafter predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed. So multiparty, single closing: an idea we borrowed from Wall Street. This means that individual donors\ncan commit without having to worry that they\'ll be left\nsupporting an underfunded plan. It\'s something like a Kickstarter project, only with a 15-year time horizon and millions of tons\nof carbon dioxide at stake. Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund\nto protect our parks, giving our government time\nto increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period. After that, our government\nguarantees full funding forever. We are almost there. We expect to close later this year. Naturally, I\'m pretty excited. (Applause) The World Wildlife Fund\nis our principle partner in this journey, and I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work\nthey are doing in Bhutan and across the world. (Applause) Whew, it is getting warm in here. I thank you for listening to our story, a story of how we are keeping\nour promise to remain carbon neutral, a story of how we are keeping\nour country pristine, for ourselves, our children, for your children and for the world. But we are not here\nto tell stories, are we? We are here to dream together. So in closing, I\'d like to share\none more dream that I have. What if we could mobilize\nour leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea\nto other countries so that they too can conserve their\nprotected areas for all time. After all, there are many other countries\nwho face the same issues that we face. They too have natural resources that can help win the world\'s fight\nfor sustainability, only they may not have the ability\nto invest in them now. So what if we set up Earth For Life, a global fund, to kickstart\nthe Bhutan For Life throughout the world? I invite you to help me, to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care\nabout our planet\'s future. After all, we\'re here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together,\nto protect our planet together. Because the reality is we are in it together. Some of us might dress differently, but we are in it together. Thank you very much, and kadrin chhe la. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, thank you, thank you.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn\'t understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraid\nto look into them. The first mystery was, I\'m 40 years old, and all throughout my lifetime,\nyear after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world. And I wanted to understand why. Why is this happening to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it harder\nto get through the day? And I wanted to understand this\nbecause of a more personal mystery. When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling,\nlike pain was leaking out of me. I couldn\'t control it, I didn\'t understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We know\nwhy people get like this. Some people just naturally get\na chemical imbalance in their heads -- you\'re clearly one of them. All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical\nbalance back to normal."" So I started taking a drug\ncalled Paxil or Seroxat, it\'s the same thing with different names\nin different countries. And I felt much better,\nI got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back. So I was given higher and higher doses until, for 13 years, I was taking\nthe maximum possible dose that you\'re legally allowed to take. And for a lot of those 13 years,\nand pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain. And I started asking myself,\n""What\'s going on here? Because you\'re doing everything you\'re told to do by the story\nthat\'s dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?"" So to get to the bottom\nof these two mysteries, for a book that I\'ve written I ended up going on a big journey\nall over the world, I traveled over 40,000 miles. I wanted to sit with the leading\nexperts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come through\ndepression and anxiety and out the other side\nin all sorts of ways. And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people\nI got to know along the way. But I think at the heart\nof what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for nine different causes\nof depression and anxiety. Two of them are indeed in our biology. Your genes can make you\nmore sensitive to these problems, though they don\'t write your destiny. And there are real brain changes\nthat can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most of the factors\nthat have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology. They are factors in the way we live. And once you understand them, it opens up a very different\nset of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option\nof chemical antidepressants. For example, if you\'re lonely, you\'re more likely\nto become depressed. If, when you go to work,\nyou don\'t have any control over your job, you\'ve just got to do what you\'re told, you\'re more likely to become depressed. If you very rarely get out\ninto the natural world, you\'re more likely to become depressed. And one thing unites a lot of the causes\nof depression and anxiety that I learned about. Not all of them, but a lot of them. Everyone here knows you\'ve all got natural\nphysical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those things away from you, you\'d all be in real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human being\nhas natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your life\nhas meaning and purpose. You need to feel that people\nsee you and value you. You need to feel you\'ve got\na future that makes sense. And this culture we built\nis good at lots of things. And many things are better\nthan in the past -- I\'m glad to be alive today. But we\'ve been getting less and less good at meeting these deep,\nunderlying psychological needs. And it\'s not the only thing\nthat\'s going on, but I think it\'s the key reason\nwhy this crisis keeps rising and rising. And I found this really hard to absorb. I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression\nas just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way we\'re living. And it only really began\nto fall into place for me when one day, I went to interview\na South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. He\'s a great guy. And Dr. Summerfield\nhappened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced\nchemical antidepressants for people in that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,\nhad never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explained. And they said to him, ""We don\'t need them,\nwe\'ve already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were going to talk about\nsome kind of herbal remedy, like St. John\'s Wort, ginkgo biloba,\nsomething like that. Instead, they told him a story. There was a farmer in their community\nwho worked in the rice fields. And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the war\nwith the United States, and he got his leg blown off. So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went back\nto work in the rice fields. But apparently, it\'s super painful\nto work under water when you\'ve got an artificial limb, and I\'m guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field\nwhere he got blown up. The guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptoms\nof classic depression. The Cambodian doctor said, ""This is when we gave him\nan antidepressant."" And Dr. Summerfield said,\n""What was it?"" They explained that they went\nand sat with him. They listened to him. They realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard for him to see it\nin the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectly\nunderstandable causes in his life. One of the doctors, talking to the people\nin the community, figured, ""You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldn\'t be in this position\nthat was screwing him up so much, he wouldn\'t have to go\nand work in the rice fields."" So they bought him a cow. Within a couple of weeks,\nhis crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone. They said to doctor Summerfield, ""So you see, doctor, that cow,\nthat was an antidepressant, that\'s what you mean, right?"" (Laughter) (Applause) If you\'d been raised to think\nabout depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctor\nfor an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodian\ndoctors knew intuitively, based on this individual,\nunscientific anecdote, is what the leading\nmedical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. If you\'re depressed, if you\'re anxious, you\'re not weak, you\'re not crazy, you\'re not, in the main,\na machine with broken parts. You\'re a human being with unmet needs. And it\'s just as important to think here\nabout what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization\nare not saying. They did not say to this farmer, ""Hey, buddy, you need\nto pull yourself together. It\'s your job to figure out\nand fix this problem on your own."" On the contrary, what they said is, ""We\'re here as a group\nto pull together with you, so together, we can figure out\nand fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs, and it\'s what every\ndepressed person deserves. This is why one of the leading\ndoctors at the United Nations, in their official statement\nfor World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk less\nabout chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances\nin the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me for a while -- but precisely because this problem\ngoes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, ""OK, I could see\nall the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the experts\nwho were explaining this,"" but I kept thinking, ""How can we\npossibly do that?"" The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex\nthan what was going on with this Cambodian farmer. Where do we even begin with that insight? But then, in the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meeting people\nwho were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. I kept meeting people\nwho were understanding the deeper causes\nof depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them. Obviously, I can\'t tell you\nabout all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depression\nand anxiety that I learned about, because they won\'t let me give\na 10-hour TED Talk -- you can complain about that to them. But I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions\nthat emerge from them, if that\'s alright. Here\'s the first. We are the loneliest society\nin human history. There was a recent study\nthat asked Americans, ""Do you feel like you\'re no longer\nclose to anyone?"" And 39 percent of people\nsaid that described them. ""No longer close to anyone."" In the international\nmeasurements of loneliness, Britain and the rest of Europe\nare just behind the US, in case anyone here is feeling smug. (Laughter) I spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expert\nin the world on loneliness, an incredible man\nnamed professor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago, and I thought a lot about one question\nhis work poses to us. Professor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestors\non the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing. They weren\'t bigger than the animals\nthey took down a lot of the time, they weren\'t faster than the animals\nthey took down a lot of the time, but they were much better\nat banding together into groups and cooperating. This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes. And it is making us feel awful. But it doesn\'t have to be this way. One of the heroes in my book,\nand in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington. He\'s a general practitioner\nin a poor part of East London, where I lived for many years. And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible\ndepression and anxiety. And like me, he\'s not opposed\nto chemical antidepressants, he thinks they give\nsome relief to some people. But he could see two things. Firstly, his patients were depressed\nand anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable\nreasons, like loneliness. And secondly, although the drugs\nwere giving some relief to some people, for many people,\nthey didn\'t solve the problem. The underlying problem. One day, Sam decided\nto pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,\nhis medical center, called Lisa Cunningham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away in her home\nwith crippling depression and anxiety for seven years. And when she came to Sam\'s center,\nshe was told, ""Don\'t worry, we\'ll carry on giving you these drugs, but we\'re also going to prescribe\nsomething else. We\'re going to prescribe for you\nto come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of other\ndepressed and anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out something\nmeaningful you can all do together so you won\'t be lonely and you won\'t feel\nlike life is pointless."" The first time this group met, Lisa literally started\nvomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming for her. But people rubbed her back,\nthe group started talking, they were like, ""What could we do?"" These are inner-city,\nEast London people like me, they didn\'t know anything about gardening. They were like, ""Why don\'t we\nlearn gardening?"" There was an area\nbehind the doctors\' offices that was just scrubland. ""Why don\'t we make this into a garden?"" They started to take books\nout of the library, started to watch YouTube clips. They started to get\ntheir fingers in the soil. They started to learn\nthe rhythms of the seasons. There\'s a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. But they started to do something\neven more important. They started to form a tribe. They started to form a group. They started to care about each other. If one of them didn\'t show up, the others would go\nlooking for them -- ""Are you OK?"" Help them figure out\nwhat was troubling them that day. The way Lisa put it to me, ""As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom."" This approach is called\nsocial prescribing, it\'s spreading all over Europe. And there\'s a small,\nbut growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real\nand meaningful falls in depression and anxiety. And one day, I remember\nstanding in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressed\nfriends had built -- it\'s a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, it\'s very much inspired by a guy\ncalled professor Hugh Mackay in Australia. I was thinking, so often\nwhen people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- I\'m sure\neveryone here said it, I have -- we say, ""You just need\nto be you, be yourself."" And I\'ve realized, actually,\nwhat we should say to people is, ""Don\'t be you. Don\'t be yourself. Be us, be we. Be part of a group."" (Applause) The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing\nmore and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that\'s partly what got us in this crisis. It lies on reconnecting\nwith something bigger than you. And that really connects\nto one of the other causes of depression and anxiety\nthat I wanted to talk to you about. So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets\nand made us physically sick. I don\'t say that\nwith any sense of superiority, I literally came to give\nthis talk from McDonald\'s. I saw all of you eating that\nhealthy TED breakfast, I was like no way. But just like junk food has taken over\nour diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk values\nhave taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years,\nphilosophers have said, if you think life is about money,\nand status and showing off, you\'re going to feel like crap. That\'s not an exact quote\nfrom Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said. But weirdly, hardy anyone\nhad scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary person\nI got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, who\'s at Knox College in Illinois, and he\'s been researching this\nfor about 30 years now. And his research suggests\nseveral really important things. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and display\nyour way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to become\ndepressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become\nmuch more driven by these beliefs. All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertising\nand Instagram and everything like them. And as I thought about this, I realized it\'s like we\'ve all been fed\nsince birth, a kind of KFC for the soul. We\'ve been trained to look for happiness\nin all the wrong places, and just like junk food\ndoesn\'t meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don\'t meet\nyour psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life. But when I first spent time\nwith professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions. Because on the one hand,\nI found this really challenging. I could see how often\nin my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind of\nshow-offy, grand external solution. And I could see why that\ndid not work well for me. I also thought,\nisn\'t this kind of obvious? Isn\'t this almost like banal, right? If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lie\non your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought\nand all the retweets you got, you\'re going to think about moments of love, meaning\nand connection in your life. I think that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talking\nto professor Kasser and saying, ""Why am I feeling\nthis strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,\nwe all know these things. But in this culture,\nwe don\'t live by them."" We know them so well\nthey\'ve become clichés, but we don\'t live by them. I kept asking why, why would we know\nsomething so profound, but not live by it? And after a while,\nprofessor Kasser said to me, ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect\nwhat is important about life."" I had to really think about that. ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us\nto neglect what is important about life."" And professor Kasser wanted to figure out\nif we can disrupt that machine. He\'s done loads of research into this; I\'ll tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone here\nto try this with their friends and family. With a guy called Nathan Dungan,\nhe got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions\nover a period of time, to meet up. And part of the point of the group was to get people to think\nabout a moment in their life they had actually found\nmeaning and purpose. For different people,\nit was different things. For some people, it was playing music,\nwriting, helping someone -- I\'m sure everyone here\ncan picture something, right? And part of the point of the group\nwas to get people to ask, ""OK, how could you dedicate\nmore of your life to pursuing these moments\nof meaning and purpose, and less to, I don\'t know,\nbuying crap you don\'t need, putting it on social media\nand trying to get people to go, \'OMG, so jealous!\'"" And what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous\nfor consumerism, right? Getting people to have these meetings,\narticulate these values, determine to act on them\nand check in with each other, led to a marked shift in people\'s values. It took them away from this hurricane\nof depression-generating messages training us to seek happiness\nin the wrong places, and towards more meaningful\nand nourishing values that lift us out of depression. But with all the solutions that I saw\nand have written about, and many I can\'t talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why did it take me so long\nto see these insights? Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are more\ncomplicated, but not all -- when you explain this to people,\nit\'s not like rocket science, right? At some level, we already\nknow these things. Why do we find it so hard to understand? I think there\'s many reasons. But I think one reason is\nthat we have to change our understanding of what depression\nand anxiety actually are. There are very real\nbiological contributions to depression and anxiety. But if we allow the biology\nto become the whole picture, as I did for so long, as I would argue our culture\nhas done pretty much most of my life, what we\'re implicitly saying to people\nis, and this isn\'t anyone\'s intention, but what we\'re implicitly\nsaying to people is, ""Your pain doesn\'t mean anything. It\'s just a malfunction. It\'s like a glitch in a computer program, it\'s just a wiring problem in your head."" But I was only able to start\nchanging my life when I realized your depression\nis not a malfunction. It\'s a signal. Your depression is a signal. It\'s telling you something. (Applause) We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see\nin the throes of depression -- I understand that really well\nfrom personal experience. But with the right help,\nwe can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they\'re a sign of weakness,\nor madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. We need to start\nlistening to these signals, because they\'re telling us\nsomething we really need to hear. It\'s only when we truly\nlisten to these signals, and we honor these signals\nand respect these signals, that we\'re going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing,\ndeeper solutions. The cows that are waiting all around us. Thank you.

It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be, back in the \'50s,\na very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger\nand bigger and bigger, and now it\'s 886 pages long. And it lists currently\n374 mental disorders. So I was leafing through it, wondering if I had any mental disorders, and it turns out I\'ve got 12. (Laughter) I\'ve got generalized anxiety disorder, which is a given. I\'ve got nightmare disorder, which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being\npursued or declared a failure, and all my dreams involve people\nchasing me down the street going, ""You\'re a failure!"" (Laughter) I\'ve got parent-child relational problems, which I blame my parents for. (Laughter) I\'m kidding. I\'m not kidding. I\'m kidding. And I\'ve got malingering. And I think it\'s actually quite rare to have both malingering\nand generalized anxiety disorder, because malingering tends\nto make me feel very anxious. Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much crazier\nthan I thought I was, or maybe it\'s not a good idea to diagnose\nyourself with a mental disorder if you\'re not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry profession\nhas a kind of strange desire to label what\'s essentially normal\nhuman behavior as a mental disorder. I didn\'t know which of these was true,\nbut I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should\nmeet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having\nlunch with the Scientologists. (Laughter) It was a man called Brian,\nwho runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy\npsychiatry wherever it lies. They\'re called the CCHR. And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-science\nthat can\'t be trusted?"" And he said, ""Yes,\nwe can prove it to you."" And I said, ""How?"" And he said, ""We\'re going\nto introduce you to Tony."" And I said, ""Who\'s Tony?"" And he said, ""Tony\'s in Broadmoor."" Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor\nAsylum for the Criminally Insane. It\'s where they send the serial killers, and the people who can\'t help themselves. And I said to Brian,\n""Well, what did Tony do?"" And he said, ""Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madness\nto get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well,\nand now he\'s stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he\'s sane. Do you want us to try and get you\ninto Broadmoor to meet Tony?"" So I said, ""Yes, please."" So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably\naround Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogs\nalso do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate\nafter gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is where\nyou get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It\'s all peach and pine\nand calming colors. And the only bold colors\nare the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight\nand wearing sweatpants, and quite docile-looking. And Brian the Scientologist\nwhispered to me, ""They\'re medicated,"" which, to the Scientologists,\nis like the worst evil in the world, but I\'m thinking\nit\'s probably a good idea. (Laughter) And then Brian said, ""Here\'s Tony."" And a man was walking in. And he wasn\'t overweight,\nhe was in very good physical shape. And he wasn\'t wearing sweatpants, he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man\nwho wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me\nthat he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said, ""So is it true\nthat you faked your way in here?"" And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely.\nI beat someone up when I was 17. And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, \'You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them you\'re mad, you\'ll get\nsent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas,\nyou\'ll have your own PlayStation.\'"" I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"" He said, ""Well, I asked to see\nthe prison psychiatrist. And I\'d just seen a film called \'Crash,\' in which people get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \'I get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashing cars into walls.\'"" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah.\nI told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would make\nme feel more normal."" I said, ""Where\'d you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biography\nof Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."" Anyway, he faked madness\ntoo well, he said. And they didn\'t send him\nto some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there, said he took one look at the place,\nasked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""There\'s been\na terrible misunderstanding. I\'m not mentally ill."" I said, ""How long have you been here for?"" He said, ""Well, if I\'d just\ndone my time in prison for the original crime,\nI\'d have got five years. I\'ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years."" Tony said that it\'s a lot harder\nto convince people you\'re sane than it is to convince them you\'re crazy. He said, ""I thought\nthe best way to seem normal would be to talk to people\nnormally about normal things like football or what\'s on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training\nbumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, \'Did you know that the U.S. Army\nis training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?\' When I read my medical notes,\nI saw they\'d written: \'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.\'"" (Laughter) He said, ""You know, they\'re always\nlooking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? It\'s just impossible."" When Tony said that to me, I thought to myself,\n""Am I sitting like a journalist? Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"" He said, ""You know, I\'ve got\nthe Stockwell Strangler on one side of me, and I\'ve got the \'Tiptoe\nThrough the Tulips\' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot\nbecause I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves\nthat I\'m aloof and grandiose."" So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting\nto hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normal\nto me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailed\nhis clinician, Anthony Maden. I said, ""What\'s the story?"" And he said, ""Yep.\nWe accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence,\nbecause his hallucinations -- that had seemed\nquite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minute\nhe got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him, and we\'ve determined that what he is is a psychopath."" And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning\nand manipulative act of a psychopath. It\'s on the checklist:\ncunning, manipulative. So, faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain\nhas gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts, and they said the pinstripe\nsuit -- classic psychopath -- speaks to items one\nand two on the checklist: glibness, superficial charm\nand grandiose sense of self-worth. And I said, ""Well, but why didn\'t\nhe hang out with the other patients?"" Classic psychopath -- it speaks\nto grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed\nmost normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me, ""If you\nwant to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopath-spotting course run by Robert Hare, who invented\nthe psychopath checklist."" So I did. I went on a psychopath-spotting course, and I am now a certified -- and I have to say, extremely adept --\npsychopath spotter. So, here\'s the statistics: One in a hundred regular people\nis a psychopath. So there\'s 1,500 people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent\nof CEOs and business leaders, so I think there\'s a very good chance there\'s about 30 or 40\npsychopaths in this room. It could be carnage\nby the end of the night. (Laughter) Hare said the reason why\nis because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhaps\nat its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation\nof psychopathy. It\'s like a form of psychopathy\nthat\'s come down to affect us all. Hare said, ""You know what?\nForget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares? That\'s not a big story. The big story,"" he said,\n""is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself\nsome corporate psychopaths."" So I gave it a try.\nI wrote to the Enron people. I said, ""Could I come\nand interview you in prison, to find out it you\'re psychopaths?"" (Laughter) And they didn\'t reply. (Laughter) So I changed tack. I emailed ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent\nof the workforce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said, ""I believe you may have\na very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special, and interested in the predatory\nspirit, and fearless. Can I come and interview you\nabout your special brain anomaly?"" And he said, ""Come on over!"" (Laughter) So I went to Al Dunlap\'s\ngrand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures\nof predatory animals. There were lions and tigers --\nhe was taking me through the garden -- there were falcons and eagles, he was saying, ""Over there\nyou\'ve got sharks and --"" he was saying this\nin a less effeminate way -- ""You\'ve got more sharks\nand you\'ve got tigers."" It was like Narnia. (Laughter) And then we went into his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in\nto save failing companies, he\'d close down 30 percent\nof the workforce. And he\'d quite often\nfire people with a joke. Like, for instance,\none famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said,\n""I\'ve just bought myself a new car."" And he said, ""Well,\nyou may have a new car, but I\'ll tell you what you\ndon\'t have -- a job."" So in his kitchen -- he was in there with his wife, Judy,\nand his bodyguard, Sean -- and I said, ""You know\nhow I said in my email that you might have a special brain\nanomaly that makes you special?"" He said, ""Yeah, it\'s an amazing\ntheory, it\'s like Star Trek. You\'re going where\nno man has gone before."" And I said, ""Well --"" (Clears throat) (Laughter) Some psychologists might say that this makes you --""\n(Mumbles) (Laughter) And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""A psychopath."" And I said, ""I\'ve got a list\nof psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you?"" And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, ""Okay, go on."" And I said, ""Okay.\nGrandiose sense of self-worth."" Which I have to say, would\nhave been hard for him to deny, because he was standing\nunder a giant oil painting of himself. (Laughter) He said, ""Well, you\'ve\ngot to believe in you!"" And I said, ""Manipulative."" He said, ""That\'s leadership."" (Laughter) And I said, ""Shallow affect, an inability to experience\na range of emotions."" He said, ""Who wants to be weighed\ndown by some nonsense emotions?"" So he was going down\nthe psychopath checklist, basically turning it\ninto ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" (Laughter) But I did notice something happening\nto me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me\nthat was kind of normal -- like he said ""no"" to juvenile delinquency, he said he got accepted into West Point, and they don\'t let\ndelinquents in West Point. He said ""no"" to many short-term\nmarital relationships. He\'s only ever been married twice. Admittedly, his first wife\ncited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered\nwhat human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages\nin the heat of an argument, and his second marriage\nhas lasted 41 years. So whenever he said anything to me\nthat just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, I thought to myself, well I\'m not\ngoing to put that in my book. And then I realized that\nbecoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me\na little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him\nin a box marked ""Psychopath."" I was desperate to define him\nby his maddest edges. And I realized, my God -- this is what I\'ve been doing for 20 years. It\'s what all journalists do. We travel across the world\nwith our notepads in our hands, and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always\nthe outermost aspects of our interviewee\'s personality. And we stitch them together\nlike medieval monks, and we leave the normal\nstuff on the floor. And you know, this is a country\nthat over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar -- children as young as four\nare being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high\non the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, ""Why haven\'t you\nbeen returning my calls?"" I said, ""Well, they say\nthat you\'re a psychopath."" And he said, ""I\'m not a psychopath."" He said, ""You know what? One of the items on the checklist\nis lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist\nis cunning, manipulative. So when you say you feel\nremorse for your crime, they say, \'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels\nremorse when he doesn\'t.\' It\'s like witchcraft, they turn\neverything upside-down."" He said, ""I\'ve got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it?"" So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after 14 years\nin Broadmoor, they let him go. They decided that he shouldn\'t\nbe held indefinitely because he scores high\non a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater\nthan average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me, ""You know what, Jon? Everyone\'s a bit psychopathic."" He said, ""You are, I am.\nWell, obviously I am."" I said, ""What are you going to do now?"" He said, ""I\'m going to go to Belgium. There\'s a woman there that I fancy. But she\'s married, so I\'m going to have\nto get her split up from her husband."" (Laughter) Anyway, that was two years ago, and that\'s where my book ended. And for the last 20 months,\neverything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was, according\nto Brian the Scientologist, making up for lost time,\nwhich I know sounds ominous, but isn\'t necessarily ominous. Unfortunately, after 20 months, he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a ""fracas""\nin a bar, he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month,\nwhich I know is bad, but at least a month implies\nthat whatever the fracas was, it wasn\'t too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what, I think\nit\'s right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn\'t define\npeople by their maddest edges. And what Tony is,\nis he\'s a semi-psychopath. He\'s a gray area in a world\nthat doesn\'t like gray areas. But the gray areas\nare where you find the complexity. It\'s where you find the humanity, and it\'s where you find the truth. And Tony said to me, ""Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you\nfor everything you\'ve done for me."" And I didn\'t go. What would you have done? Thank you.

122,0,How to spot a liar | Pamela Meyer,"On any given day we're lied to from 10 to 200 times, and the clues to detect those lie can be subtle and counter-intuitive.

(Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting\nin your very seats is a liar. We\'re all liars. What I\'m going to do today is I\'m going to show you what the research\nsays about why we\'re all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want\nto go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote\nthis book, ""Liespotting,"" no one wants to meet me in person\nanymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, ""It\'s okay, we\'ll email you."" (Laughter) I can\'t even get\na coffee date at Starbucks. My husband\'s like, ""Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.\nHow about French cooking?"" So before I get started,\nwhat I\'m going to do is I\'m going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren\'t those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room\nthat are shouting, ""Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.\nYou flared your nostril. I watch that TV show \'Lie To Me.\'\nI know you\'re lying."" No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge\nof how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature\nleaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations\nwith difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path\nby accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power\nwhatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees\nto believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point\nyou got lied to, it\'s because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:\nLying\'s a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we\'re willing\nparticipants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should\nbe kept secret, secret. We say, ""Nice song."" ""Honey, you don\'t look fat in that, no."" Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, ""You know, I just fished\nthat email out of my Spam folder. So sorry."" But there are times when we are unwilling\nparticipants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone\nin the United States. That\'s an eyelash\nunder a trillion dollars. That\'s seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case\nof double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,\nthey can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths\nof those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,\nhe was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire\nbanking system of the Western world. And you can\'t find this guy on Google;\nyou can\'t find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,\nand he said the following. He said, ""Look, I\'ve got one rule."" And this was Henry\'s rule, he said, ""Look, everyone is willing\nto give you something. They\'re ready to give you something\nfor whatever it is they\'re hungry for."" And that\'s the crux of it. If you don\'t want to be\ndeceived, you have to know, what is it that you\'re hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were\nbetter husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,\nhow we wish we could be, with what we\'re really like. And boy are we willing to fill in\nthose gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show\nthat you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes\nof meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear\nthis data, we recoil. We can\'t believe how prevalent lying is. We\'re essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,\nthe plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers\nthan we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves\nthan they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you\'re an average married couple, you\'re going to lie to your spouse\nin one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that\'s bad. If you\'re unmarried,\nthat number drops to three. Lying\'s complex. It\'s woven into the fabric\nof our daily and our business lives. We\'re deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because\nwe don\'t understand the gaps in our lives. That\'s truth number two about lying. We\'re against lying, but we\'re covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned\nfor centuries and centuries and centuries. It\'s as old as breathing. It\'s part of our culture,\nit\'s part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,\nthe Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value\nto us as a species. Researchers have long known\nthat the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla\nwho was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate\nvia sign language. Here\'s Koko with her kitten. It\'s her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten\nfor ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We\'re hardwired to become\nleaders of the pack. It\'s starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who\'s coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you\'re going to lie to your mom\nin one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world\nand we\'re breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered\nwith Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls\na post-truth society. It\'s been very confusing\nfor a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take\nto navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth\n90 percent of the time. The rest of us,\nwe\'re only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.\nWe all use the same techniques. So what I\'m going to do is I\'m going\nto show you two patterns of deception. And then we\'re going\nto look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We\'re going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:\nI want you to listen to me. I\'m going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations\nwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,\nnot a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work\nfor the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,\nwhat were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what\'s known\nas a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people\nwho are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather\nthan informal language. We also heard\ndistancing language: ""that woman."" We know that liars will unconsciously\ndistance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,\n""Well, to tell you the truth ..."" or Richard Nixon\'s favorite,\n""In all candor ..."" he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it\'s called,\nqualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated\nthe question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account\nwith a little too much detail -- and we\'re all really glad\nhe didn\'t do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,\nthere\'s much more to it than speech: ""No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,\nhe chatters with his fingertips."" And we all do it no matter\nhow powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I\'m going to show you\nDominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who\'s chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,\nwhich is body language. With body language,\nhere\'s what you\'ve got to do. You\'ve really got to just throw\nyour assumptions out the door. Let the science temper\nyour knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars\nfidget all the time. Well guess what, they\'re known to freeze\ntheir upper bodies when they\'re lying. We think liars won\'t look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look\nyou in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles\nconvey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter\ncan spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract\nthe muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile\'s in the eyes,\nthe crow\'s feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don\'t overdo the Botox;\nnobody will think you\'re honest. Now we\'re going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what\'s happening\nin a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone\'s words\nand someone\'s actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you\'re having a conversation\nwith someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked\nbut telling of indicators. An honest person\nis going to be cooperative. They\'re going to show\nthey\'re on your side. They\'re going to be enthusiastic. They\'re going to be willing and helpful\nto getting you to the truth. They\'re going to be willing\nto brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They\'re going to say, ""Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll\nthat forged those checks."" They\'re going to be infuriated\nif they sense they\'re wrongly accused throughout the entire course\nof the interview, not just in flashes; they\'ll be infuriated throughout\nthe entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen\nto whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather\nthan lenient punishment. Now let\'s say you\'re having\nthat exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person\nto tell their story, they\'re going to pepper it\nwith way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they\'re going to tell their story\nin strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways\nover the course of several hours, they will ask that person\nto tell that story backwards, and then they\'ll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce\nthe highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?\nWell, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say ""yes,"" we shake our heads ""no."" We tell very convincing stories,\nwe slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight\nin getting away with it. Now, that smile is known\nin the trade as ""duping delight."" And we\'re going to see that\nin several videos moving forward, but we\'re going to start --\nfor those of you who don\'t know him, this is presidential\ncandidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering\na child out of wedlock. We\'re going to see him talk\nabout getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him\nsaying, ""yes"" while shaking his head ""no,"" slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I\'d be happy\nto participate in one. I know that it\'s not possible\nthat this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it\'s not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,\nand would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do\nthat soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I\'m only one side.\nI\'m only one side of the test. But I\'m happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes\nare much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times\nwhen someone makes one expression while masking another that just\nkind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner\nmight shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you\nand then leak an expression of anger. And we\'re not all going to become\nfacial expression experts overnight here, but there\'s one I can teach you\nthat\'s very dangerous and it\'s easy to learn, and that\'s the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you\'ve got\ntwo people on an even playing field. It\'s still somewhat\nof a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,\nyou\'ve been dismissed. It\'s associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it\'s very,\nvery hard to recover from. Here\'s what it looks like. It\'s marked by one lip corner\npulled up and in. It\'s the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,\nwhether or not deception follows -- and it doesn\'t always follow -- look the other way,\ngo the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, ""No thank you. I\'m not coming up\nfor just one more nightcap. Thank you."" Science has surfaced\nmany, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves\nand the person that is interviewing them. They\'ll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here\'s the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They\'re not proof of deception. They\'re red flags. We\'re human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures\nall over the place all day long. They don\'t mean anything\nin and of themselves. But when you see clusters\nof them, that\'s your signal. Look, listen, probe,\nask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable\nmode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,\nask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person\nyou\'re talking to with rapport. Don\'t try to be like those folks\non ""Law & Order"" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects\ninto submission. Don\'t be too aggressive, it doesn\'t work. Now, we\'ve talked a little bit\nabout how to talk to someone who\'s lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we\'re now going\nto look at what the truth looks like. But I\'m going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,\none is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher\nDavid Matsumoto in California. And I think they\'re an excellent example\nof what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital\nwhile they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you\'ll see when you see the video, she can\'t even pretend\nto be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here\nis an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes\nand her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you\'ll see\nduping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:\nAt night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching\nher hand out to me while I\'m driving, and the blood just kept\ncoming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe\nit\'ll fade too with time -- but I don\'t think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I\'m going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,\nErin Runnion, confronting her daughter\'s murderer\nand torturer in court. Here you\'re going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression\nof a mother\'s agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:\nI wrote this statement on the third anniversary\nof the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you\nwith those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don\'t understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there\'s no doubting\nthe veracity of those emotions. Now the technology\naround what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers\nand infrared brain scans, MRI\'s that can decode the signals\nthat our bodies send out when we\'re trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going\nto be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove\nincredibly useful some day. But you\'ve got to ask yourself\nin the meantime: Who do you want on your side\nof the meeting, someone who\'s trained\nin getting to the truth or some guy who\'s going to drag\na 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, ""Character\'s who you are in the dark."" And what\'s kind of interesting\nis that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It\'s transparent\nwith blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz\nof a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live\ntheir lives in public. It\'s a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that\'s not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting\ncan blind us to the fact that the subtleties\nof human decency -- character integrity -- that\'s still what matters,\nthat\'s always what\'s going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit\nabout our moral code. When you combine the science\nof recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself\nfrom collaborating in a lie. You start up that path\nof being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, ""Hey, my world, our world,\nit\'s going to be an honest one. My world is going to be\none where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized\nand marginalized."" And when you do that, the ground around you starts\nto shift just a little bit. And that\'s the truth. Thank you.

Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out\na little like this. So, you know -- (Laughter) you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil. (Laughter) And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper\nwould come along, and then I would kind of do this. (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you\'re supposed\nto spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that,\nmy normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had\nto go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I\'d start off light, and I\'d bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end,\nI would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be\nto walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn\'t quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. (Laughter) And then -- (Laughter) But then those middle months\nactually went by, and I didn\'t really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull\ntwo all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it\'s the school. And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"" And I say, ""Yeah."" And they say, ""We need\nto talk about your thesis."" And I say, ""OK."" And they say, ""It\'s the best one we\'ve ever seen."" (Laughter) (Applause) That did not happen. (Laughter) It was a very, very bad thesis. (Laughter) I just wanted to enjoy that one moment\nwhen all of you thought, ""This guy is amazing!"" (Laughter) No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I\'m a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago,\nI decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed\nthe non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain\nto the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads\nof procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators\nwere actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven\nnon-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here\nto show you today. I want you to take a look carefully\nto see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you\'re not\na trained brain expert, it\'s not that obvious,\nbut just take a look, OK? So here\'s the brain\nof a non-procrastinator. (Laughter) Now ... here\'s my brain. (Laughter) There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational\nDecision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator\'s brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean\nfor the procrastinator? Well, it means everything\'s fine\nuntil this happens. [This is a perfect time\nto get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker\nwill make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn\'t like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, ""Actually, let\'s read\nthe entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/\nTonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered\nthat that happened. (Laughter) Then -- (Laughter) Then we\'re going to go over to the fridge, to see if there\'s anything new\nin there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we\'re going to go\non a YouTube spiral that starts with videos\nof Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later\nwith us watching interviews with Justin Bieber\'s mom. (Laughter) ""All of that\'s going to take a while, so we\'re not going to really have room\non the schedule for any work today. Sorry!"" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey\ndoes not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past,\nno knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you\'re a dog and you spend your whole life doing\nnothing other than easy and fun things, you\'re a huge success! (Laughter) And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed\nand propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times\nmight have worked OK. But, if you haven\'t noticed,\nnow we\'re not in tribal times. We\'re in an advanced civilization,\nand the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have\nanother guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things\nno other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take\nall of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense\nto be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you\'re having dinner\nor going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That\'s why there\'s an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder\nand less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that\'s when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end\na certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time\nin this orange zone, an easy and fun place that\'s entirely\nout of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators\nout there know very well. It\'s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities\nare not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn\'t actually fun,\nbecause it\'s completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt,\ndread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation,\nwith the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get\nhimself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where\nreally important things happen? Well, turns out the procrastinator\nhas a guardian angel, someone who\'s always looking\ndown on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster. (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster\nis dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up\nanytime a deadline gets too close or there\'s danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other\nscary consequence. And importantly, he\'s the only thing\nthe Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant\nin my life pretty recently, because the people of TED\nreached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now, of course, I said yes. It\'s always been a dream of mine\nto have done a TED Talk in the past. (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed\nto have something else on his mind. He was saying, ""Are we clear\non what we just accepted? Do we get what\'s going to be now\nhappening one day in the future? We need to sit down\nand work on this right now."" And the Monkey said, ""Totally agree,\nbut let\'s just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India,\nlike 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours\ntil we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India."" (Laughter) So that\'s what we did that day. (Laughter) As six months turned into four\nand then two and then one, the people of TED decided\nto release the speakers. And I opened up the website,\nand there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster\nstarts losing his mind, and a few seconds later,\nthe whole system\'s in mayhem. (Laughter) And the Monkey -- remember,\nhe\'s terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he\'s up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker\ncan take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane\nprocrastinator behavior, like how someone like me\ncould spend two weeks unable to start the opening\nsentence of a paper, and then miraculously find\nthe unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night\nand write eight pages. And this entire situation,\nwith the three characters -- this is the procrastinator\'s system. It\'s not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about\non the blog a couple of years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people\nfrom all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses,\nbankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. (Laughter) And they were all writing,\nsaying the same thing: ""I have this problem too."" But what struck me was the contrast\nbetween the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing\nwith intense frustration about what procrastination\nhad done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator\'s system\nworks, then what\'s going on? Why are all of these people\nin such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there\'s\ntwo kinds of procrastination. Everything I\'ve talked about today,\nthe examples I\'ve given, they all have deadlines. And when there\'s deadlines, the effects of procrastination\nare contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there\'s a second kind\nof procrastination that happens in situations\nwhen there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career\nwhere you\'re a self-starter -- something in the arts,\nsomething entrepreneurial -- there\'s no deadlines on those things\nat first, because nothing\'s happening, not until you\'ve gone out\nand done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There\'s also all kinds of important things\noutside of your career that don\'t involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising\nand taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship\nthat isn\'t working. Now if the procrastinator\'s only mechanism\nof doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that\'s a problem, because in all of these\nnon-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn\'t show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination,\nthey\'re not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it\'s this long-term\nkind of procrastination that\'s much less visible\nand much less talked about than the funnier, short-term\ndeadline-based kind. It\'s usually suffered\nquietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term\nunhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that\'s why\nthose people are emailing, and that\'s why they\'re\nin such a bad place. It\'s not that they\'re cramming\nfor some project. It\'s that long-term procrastination\nhas made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not\nthat they couldn\'t achieve their dreams; it\'s that they weren\'t even\nable to start chasing them. So I read these emails\nand I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don\'t think\nnon-procrastinators exist. That\'s right -- I think all of you\nare procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have\na healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey\'s sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren\'t there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That\'s one box for every week\nof a 90-year life. That\'s not that many boxes, especially since we\'ve already\nused a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long,\nhard look at that calendar. We need to think about what\nwe\'re really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating\non something in life. We need to stay aware\nof the Instant Gratification Monkey. That\'s a job for all of us. And because there\'s not\nthat many boxes on there, it\'s a job that should\nprobably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... (Laughter) You know. Sometime soon. Thank you.

And my mother packed me a suitcase\nfull of books, which to me seemed like\na perfectly natural thing to do. Because in my family,\nreading was the primary group activity. And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just\na different way of being social. You have the animal warmth of your family\nsitting right next to you, but you are also free to go\nroaming around the adventureland inside your own mind. And I had this idea that camp was going to be\njust like this, but better. (Laughter) I had a vision of 10 girls\nsitting in a cabin cozily reading books\nin their matching nightgowns. (Laughter) Camp was more like a keg party\nwithout any alcohol. And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer\nthat she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer\nto instill camp spirit. And it went like this: ""R-O-W-D-I-E, that\'s the way we spell rowdie. Rowdie, rowdie, let\'s get rowdie."" (Laughter) Yeah. So I couldn\'t figure out\nfor the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell\nthis word incorrectly. (Laughter) But I recited a cheer. I recited\na cheer along with everybody else. I did my best. And I just waited for the time\nthat I could go off and read my books. But the first time that I took\nmy book out of my suitcase, the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me, ""Why\nare you being so mellow?"" -- mellow, of course,\nbeing the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E. And then the second time I tried it, the counselor came up to me\nwith a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point\nabout camp spirit and said we should all work very hard\nto be outgoing. And so I put my books away, back in their suitcase, and I put them under my bed, and there they stayed\nfor the rest of the summer. And I felt kind of guilty about this. I felt as if the books needed me somehow, and they were calling out to me\nand I was forsaking them. But I did forsake them\nand I didn\'t open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family\nat the end of the summer. Now, I tell you this story\nabout summer camp. I could have told you\n50 others just like it -- all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet\nand introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be trying to pass\nas more of an extrovert. And I always sensed deep down\nthat this was wrong and that introverts were\npretty excellent just as they were. But for years I denied this intuition, and so I became a Wall Street\nlawyer, of all things, instead of the writer\nthat I had always longed to be -- partly because I needed to prove to myself\nthat I could be bold and assertive too. And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred\nto just have a nice dinner with friends. And I made these\nself-negating choices so reflexively, that I wasn\'t even aware\nthat I was making them. Now this is what many introverts do, and it\'s our loss for sure, but it is also our colleagues\' loss and our communities\' loss. And at the risk of sounding grandiose,\nit is the world\'s loss. Because when it comes\nto creativity and to leadership, we need introverts doing\nwhat they do best. A third to a half of the population\nare introverts -- a third to a half. So that\'s one out of every two\nor three people you know. So even if you\'re an extrovert yourself, I\'m talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting\nnext to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep\nand real in our society. We all internalize it\nfrom a very early age without even having a language\nfor what we\'re doing. Now, to see the bias clearly, you need to understand\nwhat introversion is. It\'s different from being shy. Shyness is about fear of social judgment. Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, including social stimulation. So extroverts really crave\nlarge amounts of stimulation, whereas introverts feel\nat their most alive and their most switched-on\nand their most capable when they\'re in quieter,\nmore low-key environments. Not all the time --\nthese things aren\'t absolute -- but a lot of the time. So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation\nthat is right for us. But now here\'s where the bias comes in. Our most important institutions, our schools and our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts\' need\nfor lots of stimulation. And also we have\nthis belief system right now that I call the new groupthink, which holds that all creativity\nand all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place. So if you picture the typical\nclassroom nowadays: When I was going to school,\nwe sat in rows. We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work\npretty autonomously. But nowadays, your typical classroom\nhas pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids\nall facing each other. And kids are working\nin countless group assignments. Even in subjects like math\nand creative writing, which you think would depend\non solo flights of thought, kids are now expected to act\nas committee members. And for the kids who prefer to go off\nby themselves or just to work alone, those kids are seen as outliers often or, worse, as problem cases. And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that\nthe ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert, even though introverts\nactually get better grades and are more knowledgeable, according to research. (Laughter) Okay, same thing is true\nin our workplaces. Now, most of us work in open plan offices, without walls, where we are subject to the constant\nnoise and gaze of our coworkers. And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over\nfor leadership positions, even though introverts\ntend to be very careful, much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something\nwe might all favor nowadays. And interesting research\nby Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes\nthan extroverts do, because when they are managing\nproactive employees, they\'re much more likely to let\nthose employees run with their ideas, whereas an extrovert\ncan, quite unwittingly, get so excited about things that they\'re putting\ntheir own stamp on things, and other people\'s ideas might not\nas easily then bubble up to the surface. Now in fact, some of our transformative\nleaders in history have been introverts. I\'ll give you some examples. Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi -- all these people described themselves\nas quiet and soft-spoken and even shy. And they all took the spotlight, even though every bone in their bodies\nwas telling them not to. And this turns out to have\na special power all its own, because people could feel\nthat these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure\nof being looked at; they were there\nbecause they had no choice, because they were driven to do\nwhat they thought was right. Now I think at this point\nit\'s important for me to say that I actually love extroverts. I always like to say some of my best\nfriends are extroverts, including my beloved husband. And we all fall\nat different points, of course, along the introvert/extrovert spectrum. Even Carl Jung, the psychologist\nwho first popularized these terms, said that there\'s no such thing\nas a pure introvert or a pure extrovert. He said that such a man\nwould be in a lunatic asylum, if he existed at all. And some people fall smack in the middle\nof the introvert/extrovert spectrum, and we call these people ambiverts. And I often think that they have\nthe best of all worlds. But many of us do recognize\nourselves as one type or the other. And what I\'m saying is that culturally,\nwe need a much better balance. We need more of a yin and yang\nbetween these two types. This is especially important when it comes to creativity\nand to productivity, because when psychologists look\nat the lives of the most creative people, what they find are people who are very good\nat exchanging ideas and advancing ideas, but who also have a serious\nstreak of introversion in them. And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient\noften to creativity. So Darwin, he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down\ndinner-party invitations. Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, he dreamed up many\nof his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house\nin La Jolla, California. And he was actually afraid to meet\nthe young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him\nthis kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure and would be disappointed\nwith his more reserved persona. Steve Wozniak invented\nthe first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle\nin Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time. And he says that he never would have\nbecome such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted\nto leave the house when he was growing up. Now, of course, this does not mean that we should\nall stop collaborating -- and case in point, is Steve Wozniak\nfamously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people\nit is the air that they breathe. And in fact, we have known for centuries\nabout the transcendent power of solitude. It\'s only recently that\nwe\'ve strangely begun to forget it. If you look at most\nof the world\'s major religions, you will find seekers -- Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad -- seekers who are going off by themselves\nalone to the wilderness, where they then have profound\nepiphanies and revelations that they then bring back\nto the rest of the community. So, no wilderness, no revelations. This is no surprise, though, if you look at the insights\nof contemporary psychology. It turns out that we can\'t\neven be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring,\nmimicking their opinions. Even about seemingly\npersonal and visceral things like who you\'re attracted to, you will start aping the beliefs\nof the people around you without even realizing\nthat that\'s what you\'re doing. And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant\nor charismatic person in the room, even though there\'s zero correlation between being the best talker\nand having the best ideas -- I mean zero. So -- (Laughter) You might be following the person\nwith the best ideas, but you might not. And do you really want\nto leave it up to chance? Much better for everybody\nto go off by themselves, generate their own ideas freed from the distortions\nof group dynamics, and then come together as a team to talk them through\nin a well-managed environment and take it from there. Now if all this is true, then why are we getting it so wrong? Why are we setting up our schools\nthis way, and our workplaces? And why are we making\nthese introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off\nby themselves some of the time? One answer lies deep\nin our cultural history. Western societies, and in particular the U.S., have always favored the man of action\nover the ""man"" of contemplation. But in America\'s early days, we lived in what historians\ncall a culture of character, where we still,\nat that point, valued people for their inner selves\nand their moral rectitude. And if you look at the self-help\nbooks from this era, they all had titles with things like ""Character, the Grandest\nThing in the World."" And they featured role models\nlike Abraham Lincoln, who was praised for being\nmodest and unassuming. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him ""A man who does not\noffend by superiority."" But then we hit the 20th century, and we entered a new culture that historians call\nthe culture of personality. What happened is we had evolved\nan agricultural economy to a world of big business. And so suddenly people are moving\nfrom small towns to the cities. And instead of working alongside people\nthey\'ve known all their lives, now they are having to prove themselves\nin a crowd of strangers. So, quite understandably, qualities like magnetism and charisma\nsuddenly come to seem really important. And sure enough, the self-help books\nchange to meet these new needs and they start to have names like ""How to Win Friends\nand Influence People."" And they feature as their role models\nreally great salesmen. So that\'s the world we\'re living in today. That\'s our cultural inheritance. Now none of this is to say\nthat social skills are unimportant, and I\'m also not calling\nfor the abolishing of teamwork at all. The same religions who send their sages\noff to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust. And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies\nof people coming together to solve them working together. But I am saying that the more freedom\nthat we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique\nsolutions to these problems. So now I\'d like to share with you\nwhat\'s in my suitcase today. Guess what? Books. I have a suitcase full of books. Here\'s Margaret Atwood, ""Cat\'s Eye."" Here\'s a novel by Milan Kundera. And here\'s ""The Guide for the Perplexed""\nby Maimonides. But these are not exactly my books. I brought these books with me because they were written\nby my grandfather\'s favorite authors. My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small\napartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place\nin the world when I was growing up, partly because it was filled with\nhis very gentle, very courtly presence and partly because\nit was filled with books. I mean literally every table,\nevery chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface\nfor swaying stacks of books. Just like the rest of my family, my grandfather\'s favorite thing to do\nin the whole world was to read. But he also loved his congregation, and you could feel this love\nin the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years\nthat he was a rabbi. He would takes the fruits\nof each week\'s reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries\nof ancient and humanist thought. And people would come from all over\nto hear him speak. But here\'s the thing about my grandfather. Underneath this ceremonial role, he was really modest\nand really introverted -- so much so that when\nhe delivered these sermons, he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation\nthat he had been speaking to for 62 years. And even away from the podium, when you called him to say hello, he would often end\nthe conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up\ntoo much of your time. But when he died at the age of 94, the police had to close down\nthe streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people\nwho came out to mourn him. And so these days I try to learn\nfrom my grandfather\'s example in my own way. So I just published a book\nabout introversion, and it took me about seven years to write. And for me, that seven years\nwas like total bliss, because I was reading, I was writing, I was thinking, I was researching. It was my version of my grandfather\'s hours\nof the day alone in his library. But now all of a sudden\nmy job is very different, and my job is to be\nout here talking about it, talking about introversion. (Laughter) And that\'s a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am\nto be here with all of you right now, this is not my natural milieu. So I prepared for moments\nlike these as best I could. I spent the last year\npracticing public speaking every chance I could get. And I call this my ""year\nof speaking dangerously."" (Laughter) And that actually helped a lot. But I\'ll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope\nthat when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet\nand to solitude, we truly are poised on the brink\non dramatic change. I mean, we are. And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action\nfor those who share this vision. Number one: Stop the madness for constant group work. Just stop it. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) And I want to be clear\nabout what I\'m saying, because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual, chatty\ncafe-style types of interactions -- you know, the kind\nwhere people come together and serendipitously have\nan exchange of ideas. That is great. It\'s great for introverts\nand it\'s great for extroverts. But we need much more privacy\nand much more freedom and much more autonomy at work. School, same thing. We need to be teaching kids\nto work together, for sure, but we also need to be teaching them\nhow to work on their own. This is especially important\nfor extroverted children too. They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought\ncomes from in part. Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness. Be like Buddha, have your own revelations. I\'m not saying that we all have to now go off and build\nour own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again, but I am saying that we could\nall stand to unplug and get inside our own heads\na little more often. Number three: Take a good look\nat what\'s inside your own suitcase and why you put it there. So extroverts, maybe your suitcases\nare also full of books. Or maybe they\'re full of champagne glasses\nor skydiving equipment. Whatever it is, I hope you take\nthese things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy\nand your joy. But introverts, you being you, you probably have the impulse\nto guard very carefully what\'s inside your own suitcase. And that\'s okay. But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases\nfor other people to see, because the world needs you and it\nneeds the things you carry. So I wish you the best\nof all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we\'re going to spend some time exploring your vision for what\nan exciting future might look like, which I guess makes\nthe first question a little ironic: Why are you boring? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We\'re trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully\nbe a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one of the most\nsoul-destroying things is traffic. It affects people\nin every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It\'s horrible. It\'s particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter) CA: I think you\'ve brought with you the first visualization\nthat\'s been shown of this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo this is the first time -- Just to show what we\'re talking about. So a couple of key things\nthat are important in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance\nand exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,\nthat\'s on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\nand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There\'s no speed limit here, so we\'re designing this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\nor about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes -- five, six minutes. (Applause) CA: So possibly, initially done, it\'s like on a sort\nof toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\nalleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don\'t know\nif people noticed it in the video, but there\'s no real limit\nto how many levels of tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\nthan you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper\nthan the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\nlevel of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\nis that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\nit will get used up, and then you\'ll be back where you started,\nback with congestion. But you can go to any\narbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels. CA: But people -- seen traditionally,\nit\'s incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they\'re right. To give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension, which is -- I think it\'s\na two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed\nfor two billion dollars. So it\'s roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\nutility subway in the world. So yeah, it\'s quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately\nan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\naccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\nand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\nto what we\'re attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\nby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\nwith the cross-sectional area. So that\'s roughly a half-order\nof magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\nis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\ntunneling and reinforcing, that will give you\na factor of two improvement. Combine that and that\'s a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\nto the machine substantially. I think you can get\nat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five\nimprovement on top of that. So I think there\'s a fairly\nstraightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess\nof an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we\'ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\nfrom ""South Park,"" I mean, sorry, ""SpongeBob SquarePants."" (Laughter) So Gary is capable of -- currently he\'s capable\nof going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine. (Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. (Laughter) He\'s not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory. Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining,\ndreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually\nthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn\'t that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I\'m in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets,\nso I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias\nagainst flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they\'ll be quite noisy, the wind force generated\nwill be very high. Let\'s just say that if something\'s\nflying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars\ngoing all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. (Laughter) You don\'t think to yourself,\n""Well, I feel better about today."" You\'re thinking,\n""Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off\nand guillotine me?"" Things like that. CA: So you\'ve got this vision of future cities with these rich,\n3D networks of tunnels underneath. Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\nto use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we\'ve been\nsort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\nadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative\nideas in transport. And it actually ends up being\nthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that,\nbut it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might -- so we\'ve built a little pusher car\nto push the student pods, but we\'re going to try seeing\nhow fast we can make the pusher go if it\'s not pushing something. So we\'re cautiously optimistic we\'ll be able to be faster\nthan the world\'s fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it\'s -- yeah. It\'s either going to smash\ninto tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that\nin order to make a tunnel, you have to -- In order to seal against the water table, you\'ve got to typically design\na tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out\nthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\nto resist the water table, it is automatically\ncapable of holding vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel\nis in Elon\'s future to running Hyperloop? EM: I think there\'s no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you\'d probably want\nto go underground the entire way because it\'s a high-density area. You\'re going under\na lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think,\nwell, it\'s going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\ntunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\nto detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you\'re able\nto detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money\nfor that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect\ntunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol\nthat try and detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is incredibly good\nat absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth\nis below a certain level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive\nseismic instrument, you might be able to detect it. CA: So you\'ve started\na new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny. (Laughter) EM: What\'s funny about that? (Laughter) CA: How much of your time is this? EM: It\'s maybe ... two or three percent. CA: You\'ve called it a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk\nhobby looks like. (Laughter) EM: I mean, it really is, like -- This is basically interns\nand people doing it part time. We bought some second-hand machinery. It\'s kind of puttering along,\nbut it\'s making good progress, so -- CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying\ncars and transport through Tesla. Is one of the motivations\nfor the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric\nand where they\'re self-driving, there may end up being\nmore cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think\nthat when you make cars autonomous, they\'ll be able to go faster\nand that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy\nwhere it\'s much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car\nwill be better than that of a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla\nwith the goal of persuading the world that electrification\nwas the future of cars, and a few years ago,\npeople were laughing at you. Now, not so much. EM: OK. (Laughter) I don\'t know. I don\'t know. CA: But isn\'t it true that pretty much\nevery auto manufacturer has announced\nserious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future? EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker\nhas some electric vehicle program. They vary in seriousness. Some are very serious\nabout transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it. And some, amazingly,\nare still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won\'t last much longer. CA: But isn\'t there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory\nand say, you know, ""We did it."" Let the world electrify,\nand you go on and focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla\nas far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of exciting\nthings that we have coming. Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon. We\'ll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we\'re going to come to this. So Model 3, it\'s supposed\nto be coming in July-ish. EM: Yeah, it\'s looking quite good\nfor starting production in July. CA: Wow. One of the things\nthat people are so excited about is the fact that it\'s got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology\nwould look like. EM: Yeah. CA: There\'s obviously autopilot\nin Model S right now. What are we seeing here? EM: Yeah, so this is using\nonly cameras and GPS. So there\'s no LIDAR\nor radar being used here. This is just using passive optical,\nwhich is essentially what a person uses. The whole road system\nis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don\'t solve vision,\nit\'s not solved. So that\'s why our focus is\nso heavily on having a vision neural net that\'s very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people\nare going the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most of it. EM: You can absolutely\nbe superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it\nten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars being sold right now\nhave eight cameras in them. They can\'t yet do what that showed. When will they be able to? EM: I think we\'re still on track\nfor being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end\nof the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end\nof the year, you\'re saying, someone\'s going to sit in a Tesla\nwithout touching the steering wheel, tap in ""New York,"" off it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won\'t ever have to touch the wheel --\nby the end of 2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,\nNovember or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way\nfrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point\nduring the entire journey. (Applause) CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you\'ve already got a fleet\nof Teslas driving all these roads. You\'re accumulating a huge amount\nof data of that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thing\nthat will be interesting is that I\'m actually fairly confident\nit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it\'s fairly easy -- If you say I\'m going to be really good\nat one specific route, that\'s one thing, but it should be able to go,\nreally be very good, certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country. So it\'s not sort of limited\nto LA to New York. We could change it\nand make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time. So you were going from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: So leaving aside\nregulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone, the time when someone\nwill be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands\noff the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they\'ve arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I think that\'s about two years. So the real trick of it\nis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashes\none in a thousand times, then you\'re probably still not going\nto be comfortable falling asleep. You shouldn\'t be, certainly. (Laughter) It\'s never going to be perfect. No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it\'s perhaps -- the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes,\nor a thousand lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow,\nif I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely\nnever experience a crash, then that\'s probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours\nis that people may actually get seduced too early\nto think that this is safe, and that you\'ll have some horrible\nincident happen that puts things back. EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances. The thing to appreciate\nabout vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there\'s some chance that any time\na human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accident\nthat is their fault. It\'s never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy\nneed to be than a person before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get\nliterally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt\nthe whole industry seems massive, because at that point you\'ve spoken\nof people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work,\nand then you let it go and provide a sort of Uber-like\nservice to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost\nof your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free. Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutely\nthis is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose\nto use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used\nonly by friends and family, only by other drivers\nwho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes\nbut not other times. That\'s 100 percent what will occur. It\'s just a question of when. CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you\'re planning\nto announce this in September, but I\'m curious whether there\'s\nanything you could show us today? EM: I will show you\na teaser shot of the truck. (Laughter) It\'s alive. CA: OK. EM: That\'s definitely a case\nwhere we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah. (Laughter) CA: We can\'t see that much of it, but it doesn\'t look like\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kind of badass. What sort of semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,\nlong-range semitruck. So it\'s the highest weight capability and with long range. So essentially it\'s meant to alleviate\nthe heavy-duty trucking loads. And this is something which\npeople do not today think is possible. They think the truck doesn\'t have enough\npower or it doesn\'t have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi. And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill. (Laughter) (Applause) CA: That\'s pretty cool.\nAnd short term, these aren\'t driverless. These are going to be trucks\nthat truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be\nreally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve\nwith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kind\nof internal combustion engine car, you\'ve got a torque RPM curve\nthat looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this\naround like a sports car. There\'s no gears.\nIt\'s, like, single speed. CA: There\'s a great movie\nto be made here somewhere. I don\'t know what it is\nand I don\'t know that it ends well, but it\'s a great movie. (Laughter) EM: It\'s quite bizarre test-driving. When I was driving the test prototype\nfor the first truck. It\'s really weird,\nbecause you\'re driving around and you\'re just so nimble,\nand you\'re in this giant truck. CA: Wait, you\'ve\nalready driven a prototype? EM: Yeah, I drove it\naround the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. EM: It\'s just like,\ndriving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool.\nOK, from a really badass picture to a kind of less badass picture. This is just a cute house\nfrom ""Desperate Housewives"" or something. What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustrates\nthe picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve. You\'ve got an electric car\nin the driveway. If you look in between\nthe electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls\nstacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof. So that\'s an actual solar glass roof. CA: OK. EM: That\'s a picture of a real --\nwell, admittedly, it\'s a real fake house. That\'s a real fake house. (Laughter) CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them\nbasically solar power, the ability to -- EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust\nthe texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there\'s\nsort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you\'re looking\nat the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell\nbehind it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it\nfrom a helicopter, you would be actually able\nto look through and see that some of the glass tiles have\na solar cell behind them and some do not. You can\'t tell from street level. CA: You put them in the ones\nthat are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs\nsuper affordable, right? They\'re not that much more expensive\nthan just tiling the roof. EM: Yeah. We\'re very confident\nthat the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity -- A solar glass roof will be less\nthan the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity. So in other words, this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great, and it will last -- We thought about having\nthe warranty be infinity, but then people thought, well, that might sound\nlike were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed and there\'s nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there. (Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool. So you\'re rolling this out\nin a couple week\'s time, I think, with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we\'re starting off\nwith two, two initially, and the second two\nwill be introduced early next year. CA: And what\'s the scale of ambition here? How many houses do you believe\ncould end up having this type of roofing? EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof. The thing is to consider\nthe time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don\'t start replacing\nall roofs immediately. But eventually,\nif you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof\nthat does not have solar. CA: Is there a mental model thing\nthat people don\'t get here that because of the shift in the cost,\nthe economics of solar power, most houses actually have\nenough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much\npower all their needs. You could go off-grid, kind of. EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is\nrelative to the roof area, but it\'s a fair statement to say that most houses in the US\nhave enough roof area to power all the needs of the house. CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses is the falling price\nof lithium-ion batteries, which you\'ve made a huge bet on as Tesla. In many ways, that\'s almost\nthe core competency. And you\'ve decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build\nthe world\'s largest manufacturing plant to double the world\'s supply\nof lithium-ion batteries, with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that\'s the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there\'s sort of\na diamond shape overall, and when it\'s fully done,\nit\'ll look like a giant diamond, or that\'s the idea behind it, and it\'s aligned on true north. It\'s a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours\nof batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\nWe think probably more, but yeah. CA: And they\'re actually\nbeing produced right now. EM: They\'re in production already.\nCA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That\'s the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it\'s running at full speed, you can\'t actually see the cells\nwithout a strobe light. It\'s just blur. (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\nabout what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer\nfeel guilty about energy. Help us picture this. How many Gigafactories, if you like,\ndoes it take to get us there? EM: It\'s about a hundred, roughly. It\'s not 10, it\'s not a thousand. Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take to move the world\noff this vast fossil fuel thing. It\'s like you\'re building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it\'s kind of cool\nthat you can picture that project. And you\'re planning to do, at Tesla --\nannounce another two this year. EM: I think we\'ll announce locations for somewhere between two\nand four Gigafactories later this year. Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. (Applause) No more teasing from you for here? Like -- where, continent? You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool. I think we should talk for -- Actually, global market. I\'m going to ask you one question\nabout politics, only one. I\'m kind of sick of politics,\nbut I do want to ask you this. You\'re on a body now\ngiving advice to a guy -- EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn\'t\nreally believe in climate change, and there\'s a lot of people out there\nwho think you shouldn\'t be doing that. They\'d like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all, I\'m just on two advisory councils where the format consists\nof going around the room and asking people\'s opinion on things, and so there\'s like a meeting\nevery month or two. That\'s the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree\nthat there are people in the room who are arguing in favor\nof doing something about climate change, or social issues, I\'ve used the meetings I\'ve had thus far to argue in favor of immigration\nand in favor of climate change. (Applause) And if I hadn\'t done that, that wasn\'t on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen,\nbut at least the words were said. CA: OK. (Applause) So let\'s talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like\na kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets\nthat were actually reusable. And you\'ve only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.\nWhat are we looking at here? EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from\nvery high and fast in space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I think this might have been\nat sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage. (Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up -- EM: That was the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: I thought that was\nthe sped-up version. But I mean, that\'s amazing, and several of these failed before you finally\nfigured out how to do it, but now you\'ve done this,\nwhat, five or six times? EM: We\'re at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you\'ve actually reflown\none of the rockets that landed. EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again\nand flew it again, so it\'s the first reflight\nof an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it\'s important to appreciate\nthat reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft\nto Boeing in-between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowing you\nto dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you\'ve designed\nthis outrageous rocket to do it. Help us understand\nthe scale of this thing. EM: Well, visually\nyou can see that\'s a person. Yeah, and that\'s the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that\'s like, did I read that,\na 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah. The thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times\nthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\nrocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.\nEM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only about\na quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there\'s 40 747s. So this would be the thrust equivalent\nof 120 747s, with all engines blazing. CA: And so even with a machine\ndesigned to escape Earth\'s gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually\ntake a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take\na fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers,\nmaximum cargo on the 747 -- this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this, you presented recently\nthis Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what,\n30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket. EM: I\'m hopeful it\'s sort of\nan eight- to 10-year time frame. Aspirationally, that\'s our target. Our internal targets\nare more aggressive, but I think -- (Laughter) CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison\nwith other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat. The future spaceships\nwill be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people\non it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of\nwhat you\'ve said you\'d love to do? EM: I think it\'s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning\nand you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What\'s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we\'re not out there, if the future does not include\nbeing out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it\'s incredibly depressing if that\'s not the future\nthat we\'re going to have. (Applause) CA: People want to position this\nas an either or, that there are so many desperate things\nhappening on the planet now from climate to poverty\nto, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn\'t be thinking about this. You should be solving what\'s here and now. And to be fair, you\'ve done\na fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I think there\'s -- I look at the future\nfrom the standpoint of probabilities. It\'s like a branching\nstream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take\nthat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing\nor slow down another thing. I may introduce something new\nto the probability stream. Sustainable energy\nwill happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\nif Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It\'s tautological. If you don\'t have sustainable energy,\nit means you have unsustainable energy. Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics\nwill drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value\nof a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\nthe advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good\nof a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\npotentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That\'s what I consider to be the fundamental\naspirational good of Tesla. Then there\'s becoming a multiplanet\nspecies and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable. It\'s very important to appreciate\nthis is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future\nI think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization\nis definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able\nto send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only\ntake people to low Earth orbit. Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States\ncould take no one to orbit. So that\'s the trend. The trend is like down to nothing. People are mistaken when they think that technology\njust automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people\nwork very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think,\nby itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations\nlike Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans,\nthey built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it. CA: Elon, it almost seems,\nlistening to you and looking at the different\nthings you\'ve done, that you\'ve got this unique\ndouble motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work\nfor humanity\'s long-term good. The other is the desire\nto do something exciting. And often it feels like you feel\nlike you need the one to drive the other. With Tesla, you want\nto have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy,\nexciting cars to do it. Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs.

Not just a few astronauts -- thousands of people\nare going to colonize Mars. And I am telling you\nthat they\'re going to do this soon. Some of you will end up\nworking on projects on Mars, and I guarantee that some\nof your children will end up living there. That probably sounds preposterous, so I\'m going to share with you\nhow and when that will happen. But first I want to discuss\nthe obvious question: Why the heck should we do this? 12 years ago, I gave a TED talk on 10 ways\nthe world could end suddenly. We are incredibly vulnerable\nto the whims of our own galaxy. A single, large asteroid\ncould take us out forever. To survive we have to reach\nbeyond the home planet. Think what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished\nwere suddenly obliterated. And there\'s another reason we should go: exploration is in our DNA. Two million years ago\nhumans evolved in Africa and then slowly but surely\nspread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness\nthat was beyond their horizons. This stuff is inside us. And they prospered doing that. Some of the greatest advances\nin civilization and technology came because we explored. Yes, we could do a lot of good with the money it will take\nto establish a thriving colony on Mars. And yes we should all be taking\nfar better care of our own home planet. And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars\nthe way we\'ve screwed up Earth. But think for a moment, what we had when John F. Kennedy\ntold us we would put a human on the moon. He excited an entire generation to dream. Think how inspired we will be\nto see a landing on Mars. Perhaps then we will look back at Earth and see that that is\none people instead of many and perhaps then\nwe will look back at Earth, as we struggle to survive on Mars, and realize how precious\nthe home planet is. So let me tell you about the extraordinary\nadventure we\'re about to undertake. But first, a few fascinating facts\nabout where we\'re going. This picture actually represents\nthe true size of Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not our sister planet. It\'s far less than half\nthe size of the Earth, and yet despite the fact\nthat it\'s smaller, the surface area of Mars\nthat you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area\nof the Earth that you can stand on, because the Earth\nis mostly covered by water. The atmosphere on Mars is really thin -- 100 times thinner than on Earth -- and it\'s not breathable,\nit\'s 96 percent carbon dioxide. It\'s really cold there. The average temperature\nis minus 81 degrees, although there is\nquite a range of temperature. A day on Mars is about as long\nas a day on Earth, plus about 39 minutes. Seasons and years on Mars\nare twice as long as they are on Earth. And for anybody who wants to strap\non some wings and go flying one day, Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth, and it\'s the kind of place where you can jump over your car\ninstead of walk around it. Now, as you can see,\nMars isn\'t exactly Earth-like, but it\'s by far the most livable\nother place in our entire solar system. Here\'s the problem. Mars is a long way away, a thousand times farther away\nfrom us than our own moon. The Moon is 250,000 miles away and it took Apollo astronauts\nthree days to get there. Mars is 250 million miles away and it will take us\neight months to get there -- 240 days. And that\'s only if we launch\non a very specific day, at a very specific time, once every two years, when Mars and the Earth\nare aligned just so, so the distance that the rocket\nwould have to travel will be the shortest. 240 days is a long time to spend\ntrapped with your colleagues in a tin can. And meanwhile, our track record\nof getting to Mars is lousy. We and the Russians,\nthe Europeans, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians, have actually sent 44 rockets there, and the vast majority of them\nhave either missed or crashed. Only about a third of the missions\nto Mars have been successful. And we don\'t at the moment have\na rocket big enough to get there anyway. We once had that rocket, the Saturn V. A couple of Saturn Vs\nwould have gotten us there. It was the most magnificent\nmachine ever built by humans, and it was the rocket\nthat took us to the Moon. But the last Saturn V was used in 1973\nto launch the Skylab space station, and we decided to do\nsomething called the shuttle instead of continuing on to Mars\nafter we landed on the Moon. The biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough\nto get us anything to Mars. So getting to Mars is not going to be easy and that brings up\na really interesting question ... how soon will the first humans\nactually land here? Now, some pundits think\nif we got there by 2050, that\'d be a pretty good achievement. These days, NASA seems to be saying\nthat it can get humans to Mars by 2040. Maybe they can. I believe that they can get\nhuman beings into Mars orbit by 2035. But frankly, I don\'t think they\'re going to bother\nin 2035 to send a rocket to Mars, because we will already be there. We\'re going to land on Mars in 2027. And the reason is this man is determined\nto make that happen. His name is Elon Musk,\nhe\'s the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Now, he actually told me\nthat we would land on Mars by 2025, but Elon Musk is more\noptimistic than I am -- and that\'s going a ways -- so I\'m giving him\na couple of years of slack. Still ... you\'ve got to ask yourself, can this guy really do this\nby 2025 or 2027? Well, let\'s put a decade with Elon Musk\ninto a little perspective. Where was this 10 years ago? That\'s the Tesla electric automobile. In 2005, a lot of people\nin the automobile industry were saying, we would not have\na decent electric car for 50 years. And where was that? That is SpaceX\'s Falcon 9 rocket, lifting six tons of supplies\nto the International Space Station. 10 years ago, SpaceX had not launched anything,\nor fired a rocket to anywhere. So I think it\'s a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizing\nthe automobile industry in less than 10 years and the person who created an entire\nrocket company in less than 10 years will get us to Mars by 2027. Now, you need to know this: governments and robots\nno longer control this game. Private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy\nto take you to Mars. And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there? Now, NASA may not be able\nto get us there until 2040, or we may get there\na long time before NASA, but NASA has taken a huge responsibility\nin figuring out how we can live on Mars. Let\'s look at the problem this way. Here\'s what you need to live on Earth: food, water, shelter and clothing. And here\'s what you need to live on Mars: all of the above, plus oxygen. So let\'s look at the most\nimportant thing on this list first. Water is the basis\nof all life as we know it, and it\'s far too heavy for us to carry\nwater from the Earth to Mars to live, so we have to find water\nif our life is going to succeed on Mars. And if you look at Mars,\nit looks really dry, it looks like the entire\nplanet is a desert. But it turns out that it\'s not. The soil alone on Mars\ncontains up to 60 percent water. And a number of orbiters that we still\nhave flying around Mars have shown us -- and by the way,\nthat\'s a real photograph -- that lots of craters on Mars\nhave a sheet of water ice in them. It\'s not a bad place to start a colony. Now, here\'s a view of a little dig\nthe Phoenix Lander did in 2008, showing that just below\nthe surface of the soil is ice -- that white stuff is ice. In the second picture, which is four days later\nthan the first picture, you can see that\nsome of it is evaporating. Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts\nof underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. In fact, if only the water ice\nat the poles on Mars melted, most of the planet\nwould be under 30 feet of water. So there\'s plenty of water there, but most of it\'s ice,\nmost of it\'s underground, it takes a lot of energy to get it\nand a lot of human labor. This is a device cooked up\nat the University of Washington back in 1998. It\'s basically a low-tech dehumidifier. And it turns out the Mars atmosphere\nis often 100 percent humid. So this device can extract\nall the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars. Next we have to worry\nabout what we will breathe. Frankly, I was really shocked to find out that NASA\nhas this problem worked out. This is a scientist at MIT\nnamed Michael Hecht. And he\'s developed this machine, Moxie. I love this thing. It\'s a reverse fuel cell, essentially, that sucks in the Martian atmosphere\nand pumps out oxygen. And you have to remember that CO2 -- carbon dioxide, which is\n96 percent of Mars\' atmosphere -- CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen. Now, the next big rover\nthat NASA sends to Mars in 2020 is going to have one\nof these devices aboard, and it will be able\nto produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely. But the secret to this -- and that\'s just for testing -- the secret to this is that this thing\nwas designed from the get-go to be scalable by a factor of 100. Next, what will we eat? Well, we\'ll use hydroponics to grow food, but we\'re not going to be able to grow more than 15 to 20 percent\nof our food there, at least not until water is running\non the surface of Mars and we actually have the probability\nand the capability of planting crops. In the meantime, most of our food will arrive from Earth, and it will be dried. And then we need some shelter. At first we can use inflatable,\npressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves. But this really only works\nduring the daytime. There is too much solar radiation\nand too much radiation from cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground. Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars, by and large,\nis perfect for making bricks. And NASA has figured this one out, too. They\'re going to throw\nsome polymer plastic into the bricks, shove them in a microwave oven, and then you will be able to build\nbuildings with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground\nin caves or in lava tubes, of which there are plenty. And finally there\'s clothing. On Earth we have miles\nof atmosphere piled up on us, which creates 15 pounds of pressure\non our bodies at all times, and we\'re constantly\npushing out against that. On Mars there\'s hardly\nany atmospheric pressure. So Dava Newman, a scientist at MIT, has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together, block radiation and keep us warm. So let\'s think about this for a minute. Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ... we can do this. We really can. But it\'s still a little complicated\nand a little difficult. So that leads to the next big -- really big step -- in living the good life on Mars. And that\'s terraforming the planet: making it more like Earth, reengineering an entire planet. That sounds like a lot of hubris, but the truth is that the technology to do everything\nI\'m about to tell you already exists. First we\'ve got to warm it up. Mars is incredibly cold\nbecause it has a very thin atmosphere. The answer lies here, at the south pole\nand at the north pole of Mars, both of which are covered with an incredible amount\nof frozen carbon dioxide -- dry ice. If we heat it up, it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere\nthe same way it does on Earth. And as we know, CO2 is an incredibly\npotent greenhouse gas. Now, my favorite way of doing this\nis to erect a very, very large solar sail and focus it -- it essentially serves as a mirror -- and focus it on the south pole\nof Mars at first. As the planet spins, it will heat up\nall that dry ice, sublime it, and it will go into the atmosphere. It actually won\'t take long for the temperature\non Mars to start rising, probably less than 20 years. Right now, on a perfect day at the equator, in the middle of summer on Mars, temperatures can\nactually reach 70 degrees, but then they go down\nto minus 100 at night. (Laughter) What we\'re shooting for\nis a runaway greenhouse effect: enough temperature rise\nto see a lot of that ice on Mars -- especially the ice in the ground -- melt. Then we get some real magic. As the atmosphere gets thicker,\neverything gets better. We get more protection from radiation, more atmosphere makes us warmer,\nmakes the planet warmer, so we get running water and that makes crops possible. Then more water vapor goes into the air,\nforming yet another potent greenhouse gas. It will rain and it will snow on Mars. And a thicker atmosphere\nwill create enough pressure so that we can\nthrow away those space suits. We only need about five pounds\nof pressure to survive. Eventually, Mars will be made\nto feel a lot like British Columbia. We\'ll still be left\nwith the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable, and frankly that could take\n1,000 years to accomplish. But humans are amazingly smart\nand incredibly adaptable. There is no telling what our future\ntechnology will be able to accomplish and no telling what we can do\nwith our own bodies. In biology right now, we are on the very verge of being\nable to control our own genetics, what the genes\nin our own bodies are doing, and certainly, eventually, our own evolution. We could end up with a species\nof human being on Earth that is slightly different\nfrom the species of human beings on Mars. But what would you do there?\nHow would you live? It\'s going to be\nthe same as it is on Earth. Somebody\'s going to start a restaurant, somebody\'s going to build an iron foundry. Someone will make\ndocumentary movies of Mars and sell them on Earth. Some idiot will start a reality TV show. (Laughter) There will be software companies, there will be hotels, there will be bars. This much is certain: it will be the most disruptive\nevent in our lifetimes, and I think it will be the most inspiring. Ask any 10-year-old girl\nif she wants to go to Mars. Children who are now in elementary school\nare going to choose to live there. Remember when we landed\nhumans on the Moon? When that happened,\npeople looked at each other and said, ""If we can do this, we can do anything."" What are they going to think\nwhen we actually form a colony on Mars? Most importantly, it will make us a spacefaring species. And that means humans will survive\nno matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last of our kind. Thank you.

And today, after briefly describing what they found, I\'m going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery, namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth, the Milky Way and other distant galaxies, we may find that our universe is not the only universe, but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one. I mean, most of us were raised to believe that the word ""universe"" means everything. And I say most of us with forethought, as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born. And last year I was holding her and I said, ""Sophia, I love you more than anything in the universe."" And she turned to me and said, ""Daddy, universe or multiverse?"" (Laughter) But barring such an anomalous upbringing, it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes of their own. And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there\'s reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right. I\'m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts. In part one, I\'m going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. In part two, I\'ll offer a solution to that mystery. It\'s based on an approach called string theory, and that\'s where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story. Finally, in part three, I\'m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation, which will pull all the pieces of the story together. Okay, part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us, establishing that space itself is stretching, it\'s expanding. Now this was revolutionary. The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static. But even so, there was one thing that everyone was certain of: The expansion must be slowing down. That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward, the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space. Now let\'s fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing. And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies, allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here\'s the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down. Instead they found that it\'s speeding up, going faster and faster. That\'s like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. Now if you saw an apple do that, you\'d want to know why. What\'s pushing on it? Similarly, the astronomers\' results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize, but they raised an analogous question. What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed? Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein\'s. You see, we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing, pulls objects together. But in Einstein\'s theory of gravity, his general theory of relativity, gravity can also push things apart. How? Well according to Einstein\'s math, if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy, sort of like a uniform, invisible mist, then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive, repulsive gravity, which is just what we need to explain the observations. Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy, but I\'ve made it smokey white here so you can see it -- its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other, driving expansion to speed up, not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here in part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed in the relevant unit, it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder, should you care? Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail of interest to experts, but of no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter. Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality, and this peculiar number may be doing just that, as the only approach that\'s so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes -- an idea that naturally emerges from string theory, which takes me to part two: string theory. So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory. First off, what is it? Well it\'s an approach to realize Einstein\'s dream of a unified theory of physics, a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe. And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely, at first you\'ll find molecules and then you\'ll find atoms and subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller, much smaller than we can with existing technology, you\'d find something else inside these particles -- a little tiny vibrating filament of energy, a little tiny vibrating string. And just like the strings on a violin, they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. These little fundamental strings, when they vibrate in different patterns, they produce different kinds of particles -- so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons, all other particles would be united into a single framework, as they would all arise from vibrating strings. It\'s a compelling picture, a kind of cosmic symphony, where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little, tiny strings can play. But there\'s a cost to this elegant unification, because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn\'t quite work. It has internal inconsistencies, unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space. That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space. And you can think about those as height, width and depth. But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales, there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. And in string theory, vibration determines everything. So particle masses, the strengths of forces, and most importantly, the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions, we should be able to calculate these features, calculate the amount of dark energy. The challenge is we don\'t know the shape of the extra dimensions. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed, there were only about five different candidate shapes, so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands -- A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze, since after all, graduate students need something to do. But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions, until today. The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500. So, what to do? Well some researchers lost heart, concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each giving rise to different physical features, string theory would never make definitive, testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head, taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. Here\'s the idea. Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other. Each is as real as every other, in the sense that there are many universes, each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery: the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results. Because you see, if there are other universes, and if those universes each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions, then the physical features of each universe will be different, and in particular, the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we\'ve now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context, the laws of physics can\'t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn\'t just one number, there are many numbers. Which means we have been asking the wrong question. It\'s that the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we\'ve measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there? And that\'s a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours, whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies, the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don\'t form. And in those universes that have much less dark energy, well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that, again, galaxies don\'t form. And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes. So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we\'ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life. And that would be that. Mystery solved, multiverse found. Now some find this explanation unsatisfying. We\'re used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. But the point is, if the feature you\'re observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality, then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades trying to explain this number, but he never succeeded, and we know why. Kepler was asking the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars. So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is, why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance, instead of any of the other possibilities? And again, that\'s a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn\'t exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they\'re so cold that, again, our form of life would not take hold. So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. And when it comes to planets and their distances, this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. The point is, when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain, it may also be the right kind of reasoning. One key difference, of course, is we know that there are other planets out there, but so far I\'ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together, we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my final part, part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang. You see, when we speak of the Big Bang, we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward. But there\'s a little secret. The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important, the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory. It\'s called inflationary cosmology, which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it\'s virtually impossible to use it all up, which means in the inflationary theory, the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event. Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang, but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs, each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes. And now, when we meld this with string theory, here\'s the picture we\'re led to. Each of these universes has extra dimensions. The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes. The different shapes yield different physical features. And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it\'s only in our universe that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy, are right for our form of life to take hold. And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remaining question, of course, is, could we ever confirm the existence of other universes? Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. The inflationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded, tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world, yielding a distinctive fingerprint, a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots, across space, which powerful telescopes have now observed. Going further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes. I\'ll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expanding, that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up, in the very far future, those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won\'t be able to see them -- not because of technological limitations, but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit, even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light, will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static, inky, black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit -- a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era, like ours, attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge? Or would they believe in the black, static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal? I suspect the latter. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today\'s astronomers, by turning powerful telescopes to the sky, have captured a handful of starkly informative photons -- a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. Thank you very much. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you. The range of ideas you\'ve just spoken about are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible. How do you think of where cosmology is now, in a sort of historical side? Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion? BG: Well it\'s hard to say. When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out, the natural question is, maybe we\'re already in that position and certain deep, critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective, maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. On the other hand, we now can understand how old the universe is. We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. Holy cow! That\'s just amazing. So on the one hand, it\'s just incredible where we\'ve gotten, but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future. CA: You\'re going to be around for the next few days. Maybe some of these conversations can continue. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)

128,0,Why do we sleep? | Russell Foster,"Russell Foster is a circadian neuroscientist: He studies the sleep cycles of the brain. And he asks: What do we know about sleep? Not a lot, it turns out, for something we do with one-third of our lives.

Now, there is a sound -- (Alarm clock) Ah, it worked! A sound that is desperately\nfamiliar to most of us, and of course it\'s the sound\nof the alarm clock. And what that truly ghastly,\nawful sound does is stop the single most important\nbehavioral experience that we have, and that\'s sleep. If you\'re an average sort of person, 36 percent of your life\nwill be spent asleep, which means that if you live to 90, then 32 years will have\nbeen spent entirely asleep. Now what that 32 years is telling us\nis that sleep at some level is important. And yet, for most of us,\nwe don\'t give sleep a second thought. We throw it away. We really just don\'t think about sleep. And so what I\'d like to do today\nis change your views, change your ideas\nand your thoughts about sleep. And the journey\nthat I want to take you on, we need to start by going back in time. ""Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."" Any ideas who said that? Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar. Yes, let me give you a few more quotes. ""O sleep, O gentle sleep,\nnature\'s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee?"" Shakespeare again, from --\nI won\'t say it -- the Scottish play. (Laughter) From the same time: ""Sleep is the golden chain\nthat ties health and our bodies together."" Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,\nanother Elizabethan dramatist. But if we jump forward 400 years, the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison,\nfrom the beginning of the 20th century: ""Sleep is a criminal waste of time\nand a heritage from our cave days."" Bang! (Laughter) And if we also jump into the 1980s,\nsome of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher\nwas reported to have said, ""Sleep is for wimps."" And of course the infamous --\nwhat was his name? -- the infamous Gordon Gekko\nfrom ""Wall Street"" said, ""Money never sleeps."" What do we do in the 20th\ncentury about sleep? Well, of course, we use\nThomas Edison\'s light bulb to invade the night,\nand we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we\'ve treated sleep as an illness, almost. We\'ve treated it as an enemy. At most now, I suppose,\nwe tolerate the need for sleep, and at worst perhaps\nmany of us think of sleep as an illness that needs\nsome sort of a cure. And our ignorance about sleep\nis really quite profound. Why is it? Why do we abandon\nsleep in our thoughts? Well, it\'s because you don\'t do anything\nmuch while you\'re asleep, it seems. You don\'t eat. You don\'t drink. And you don\'t have sex. Well, most of us anyway. And so, therefore it\'s -- Sorry. It\'s a complete waste of time, right? Wrong. Actually, sleep is an incredibly\nimportant part of our biology, and neuroscientists\nare beginning to explain why it\'s so very important. So let\'s move to the brain. Now, here we have a brain. This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn\'t know what\nit was or indeed, how to use it, so -- (Laughter) Sorry. So I borrowed it. I don\'t think they noticed. OK. (Laughter) The point I\'m trying to make\nis that when you\'re asleep, this thing doesn\'t shut down. In fact, some areas of the brain\nare actually more active during the sleep state\nthan during the wake state. The other thing that\'s really\nimportant about sleep is that it doesn\'t arise from a single\nstructure within the brain, but is to some extent a network property. If we flip the brain on its back -- I love this little bit\nof spinal cord here -- this bit here is the hypothalamus, and right under there is a whole raft\nof interesting structures, not least the biological clock. The biological clock tells us\nwhen it\'s good to be up, when it\'s good to be asleep, and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas\nwithin the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus,\nthe ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. All of those combine, and they send projections\ndown to the brain stem here. The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex,\nthis wonderfully wrinkly bit over here, with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us\nwith our consciousness. So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions\nwithin the brain, and essentially,\nsleep is turned on and off as a result of a range\nof interactions in here. OK. So where have we got to? We\'ve said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life. But what I haven\'t explained\nis what sleep is about. So why do we sleep? And it won\'t surprise\nany of you that, of course, as scientists, we don\'t have a consensus. There are dozens of different ideas\nabout why we sleep, and I\'m going to outline three of those. The first is sort of the restoration idea, and it\'s somewhat intuitive. Essentially, all the stuff\nwe\'ve burned up during the day, we restore, we replace,\nwe rebuild during the night. And indeed, as an explanation,\nit goes back to Aristotle, so that\'s what -- 2,300 years ago. It\'s gone in and out of fashion. It\'s fashionable at the moment because what\'s been shown\nis that within the brain, a whole raft of genes have been shown\nto be turned on only during sleep, and those genes are associated\nwith restoration and metabolic pathways. So there\'s good evidence\nfor the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation? Again, perhaps intuitive. You essentially sleep to save calories. Now, when you do the sums,\nthough, it doesn\'t really pan out. If you compare an individual\nwho has slept at night, or stayed awake\nand hasn\'t moved very much, the energy saving of sleeping\nis about 110 calories a night. Now, that\'s the equivalent\nof a hot dog bun. Now, I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated\nand demanding behavior as sleep. So I\'m less convinced\nby the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I\'m quite attracted to, which is brain processing\nand memory consolidation. What we know is that,\nif after you\'ve tried to learn a task, and you sleep-deprive individuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed. It\'s really hugely attenuated. So sleep and memory consolidation\nis also very important. However, it\'s not just\nthe laying down of memory and recalling it. What\'s turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up\nwith novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep. In fact, it\'s been estimated\nto give us a threefold advantage. Sleeping at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be going on\nis that, in the brain, those neural connections\nthat are important, those synaptic connections\nthat are important, are linked and strengthened, while those that are less important\ntend to fade away and be less important. OK. So we\'ve had three explanations\nfor why we might sleep, and I think the important thing to realize\nis that the details will vary, and it\'s probable we sleep\nfor multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an indulgence. It\'s not some sort of thing that we can\ntake on board rather casually. I think that sleep was once\nlikened to an upgrade from economy to business class,\nyou know, the equivalent of. It\'s not even an upgrade\nfrom economy to first class. The critical thing to realize is that\nif you don\'t sleep, you don\'t fly. Essentially, you never get there. And what\'s extraordinary\nabout much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep-deprived. So let\'s now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors of society\nare sleep-deprived, and let\'s look at our sleep-o-meter. So in the 1950s, good data\nsuggests that most of us were getting around eight hours\nof sleep a night. Nowadays, we sleep one and a half\nto two hours less every night, so we\'re in the six-and-a-half-hours\nevery-night league. For teenagers, it\'s worse, much worse. They need nine hours\nfor full brain performance, and many of them, on a school night,\nare only getting five hours of sleep. It\'s simply not enough. If we think about other sectors\nof society -- the aged; if you are aged, then your ability\nto sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted,\nand many sleep, again, less than five hours a night. Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary, perhaps 20 percent\nof the working population, and the body clock does not shift\nto the demands of working at night. It\'s locked onto the same\nlight-dark cycle as the rest of us. So when the poor old\nshift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day,\ndesperately tired, the body clock is saying,\n""Wake up. This is the time to be awake."" So the quality of sleep\nthat you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor,\nagain in that sort of five-hour region. And then, of course, tens of millions\nof people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag? Well, my goodness gracious. Well, thank you very much\nindeed for not falling asleep, because that\'s what your brain is craving. One of the things that the brain does\nis indulge in micro-sleeps, this involuntary falling asleep, and you have essentially\nno control over it. Now, micro-sleeps can be sort\nof somewhat embarrassing, but they can also be deadly. It\'s been estimated\nthat 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel\nat least once in their life, and in the US, the statistics\nare pretty good: 100,000 accidents on the freeway\nhave been associated with tiredness, loss of vigilance, and falling asleep --\na hundred thousand a year. It\'s extraordinary. At another level of terror, we dip into the tragic\naccidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger, which was so tragically lost. And in the investigations\nthat followed those disasters, poor judgment as a result\nof extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk\nof those disasters. When you\'re tired and you lack sleep, you have poor memory,\nyou have poor creativity, you have increased impulsiveness, and you have overall poor judgment. But my friends,\nit\'s so much worse than that. (Laughter) If you are a tired brain, the brain is craving things to wake it up. So drugs, stimulants. Caffeine represents\nthe stimulant of choice across much of the Western world. Much of the day is fueled by caffeine, and if you\'re a really naughty\ntired brain, nicotine. Of course, you\'re fueling the waking state\nwith these stimulants, and then, of course, it gets\nto 11 o\'clock at night, and the brain says to itself, ""Actually, I need\nto be asleep fairly shortly. What do we do about that\nwhen I\'m feeling completely wired?"" Well, of course,\nyou then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol, short-term,\nyou know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you,\ncan be very useful. It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware of\nis that alcohol doesn\'t provide sleep. A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you. So it actually harms\nsome of the neural processing that\'s going on during memory\nconsolidation and memory recall. So it\'s a short-term acute measure, but for goodness sake, don\'t become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night. Another connection\nbetween loss of sleep is weight gain. If you sleep around\nabout five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent\nlikelihood of being obese. What\'s the connection here? Well, sleep loss seems to give rise\nto the release of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone. Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain. The brain says, ""I need carbohydrates,"" and what it does is seek out carbohydrates\nand particularly sugars. So there\'s a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition\nfor weight gain: stress. Tired people are massively stressed. And one of the things of stress,\nof course, is loss of memory, which is what I sort of just then\nhad a little lapse of. But stress is so much more. So, if you\'re acutely stressed,\nnot a great problem, but it\'s sustained stress associated\nwith sleep loss that\'s the problem. Sustained stress leads\nto suppressed immunity. And so, tired people tend to have\nhigher rates of overall infection, and there\'s some very good studies showing that shift workers, for example,\nhave higher rates of cancer. Increased levels of stress\nthrow glucose into the circulation. Glucose becomes a dominant part\nof the vasculature and essentially you become\nglucose intolerant. Therefore, diabetes 2. Stress increases cardiovascular disease\nas a result of raising blood pressure. So there\'s a whole raft of things\nassociated with sleep loss that are more than just\na mildly impaired brain, which is where I think most people think\nthat sleep loss resides. So at this point in the talk,\nthis is a nice time to think, ""Well, do you think on the whole\nI\'m getting enough sleep?"" So a quick show of hands. Who feels that they\'re getting\nenough sleep here? Oh. Well, that\'s pretty impressive. Good. We\'ll talk more about that later,\nabout what are your tips. So most of us, of course,\nask the question, ""How do I know whether\nI\'m getting enough sleep?"" Well, it\'s not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to get\nyou out of bed in the morning, if you are taking a long time to get up, if you need lots of stimulants, if you\'re grumpy, if you\'re irritable, if you\'re told by your work colleagues\nthat you\'re looking tired and irritable, chances are you are sleep-deprived. Listen to them. Listen to yourself. What do you do? Well -- and this is slightly offensive -- sleep for dummies. (Laughter) Make your bedroom a haven for sleep. The first critical thing is make it\nas dark as you possibly can, and also make it slightly cool. Very important. Actually, reduce your amount\nof light exposure at least half an hour\nbefore you go to bed. Light increases levels of alertness\nand will delay sleep. What\'s the last thing that most of us\ndo before we go to bed? We stand in a massively lit bathroom, looking into the mirror\ncleaning our teeth. It\'s the worst thing we can possibly do\nbefore we go to sleep. Turn off those mobile phones.\nTurn off those computers. Turn off all of those things\nthat are also going to excite the brain. Try not to drink caffeine\ntoo late in the day, ideally not after lunch. Now, we\'ve set about reducing light\nexposure before you go to bed, but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological\nclock to the light-dark cycle. So seek out morning light. Basically, listen to yourself. Wind down. Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey-heavy dew of slumber. OK. That\'s some facts. What about some myths? Teenagers are lazy. No. Poor things. They have a biological predisposition\nto go to bed late and get up late, so give them a break. We need eight hours of sleep a night. That\'s an average. Some people need more.\nSome people need less. And what you need to do\nis listen to your body. Do you need that much or do you need more? Simple as that. Old people need less sleep. Not true. The sleep demands of the aged\ndo not go down. Essentially, sleep fragments\nand becomes less robust, but sleep requirements do not go down. And the fourth myth\nis early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Well, that\'s wrong\nat so many different levels. (Laughter) There is no evidence that getting up early\nand going to bed early gives you more wealth at all. There\'s no difference\nin socioeconomic status. In my experience, the only difference between morning\npeople and evening people is that those people that get up\nin the morning early are just horribly smug. (Laughter) (Applause) OK. So for the last few minutes, what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new,\nbreaking areas of neuroscience, which is the association\nbetween mental health, mental illness and sleep disruption. We\'ve known for 130 years\nthat in severe mental illness, there is always, always sleep disruption, but it\'s been largely ignored. In the 1970s, when people started\nto think about this again, they said, ""Yes, well, of course you have\nsleep disruption in schizophrenia, because they\'re on antipsychotics. It\'s the antipsychotics causing\nthe sleep problems,"" ignoring the fact that\nfor a hundred years previously, sleep disruption had been reported\nbefore antipsychotics. So what\'s going on? Several groups are studying conditions like depression,\nschizophrenia and bipolar and what\'s going on\nin terms of sleep disruption. We have a big study which we published\nlast year on schizophrenia, and the data were quite extraordinary. In those individuals with schizophrenia, much of the time, they were awake\nduring the night phase and then they were asleep during the day. Other groups showed no 24-hour\npatterns whatsoever -- their sleep was absolutely smashed. And some had no ability to regulate\ntheir sleep by the light-dark cycle. They were getting up later and later\nand later and later each night. It was smashed. So what\'s going on? And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep\nare not simply associated, but they are physically linked\nwithin the brain. The neural networks that predispose\nyou to normal sleep, give you normal sleep, and those that give you normal\nmental health, are overlapping. And what\'s the evidence for that? Well, genes that have been shown to be very important\nin the generation of normal sleep, when mutated, when changed, also predispose individuals\nto mental health problems. And last year, we published a study which showed that a gene\nthat\'s been linked to schizophrenia, when mutated, also smashes the sleep. So we have evidence\nof a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. Other work flowed from these studies. The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types\nof mental illness, and we\'ve shown that\nin those young individuals who are at high risk\nof developing bipolar disorder, they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical\ndiagnosis of bipolar. The other bit of data\nwas that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate, make worse,\nthe mental illness state. My colleague Dan Freeman\nhas used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep\nand reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by 50 percent. So what have we got? We\'ve got, in these connections,\nsome really exciting things. In terms of the neuroscience, by understanding these two systems, we\'re really beginning to understand\nhow both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated\nwithin the brain. The second area\nis that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption\nas an early warning signal, then we have the chance of going in. If we know these individuals\nare vulnerable, early intervention then becomes possible. And the third, which I think\nis the most exciting, is that we can think\nof the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target. Stabilize sleep in those individuals\nwho are vulnerable, we can certainly make them healthier, but also alleviate some of the appalling\nsymptoms of mental illness. So let me just finish. What I started by saying is:\nTake sleep seriously. Our attitudes toward sleep\nare so very different from a pre-industrial age, when we were almost wrapped in a duvet. We used to understand intuitively\nthe importance of sleep. And this isn\'t some sort\nof crystal-waving nonsense. This is a pragmatic response\nto good health. If you have good sleep,\nit increases your concentration, attention, decision-making,\ncreativity, social skills, health. If you get sleep, it reduces\nyour mood changes, your stress, your levels of anger, your impulsivity, and your tendency to drink and take drugs. And we finished by saying that an understanding\nof the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes\nof mental illness, and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly\ndebilitating conditions. Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said, ""Sleep is God. Go worship."" And I can only recommend\nthat you do the same. Thank you for your attention.

Now, I promise to tell the truth tonight, but just to humor that demographic, I've started this talk with a falsehood. [The Paris Climate Accord\nis a product of the recognition that climate change\nis a global problem ...] This statement was not made\nby President Obama. It was made by President Reagan, and it wasn't about climate change\nand the Paris Climate Accord. It was actually\nabout the Montreal Protocol and stratospheric ozone depletion. Now, I'm sure that many of you aren't\nfamiliar with this environmental problem, but you should be, because it's a rare\nenvironmental success story. And it's worth revisiting, because sometimes, we need\nto examine the world we've avoided in order to find guidance\nfor the choices we make today. So let's go back to the 1970s, when some questionable choices were made: first of all -- hoo --\nhairstyles. (Laughs) Second of all, objectively\nterrible quantities of hairspray, and third, CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, man-made chemicals that were used\nas propellant in aerosol spray cans. And see, it turns out\nthese CFCs were a problem because they were destroying\nthe ozone layer. Now I'm sure most of you\nhave heard of the ozone layer, but why does it matter? Well, quite simply,\nthe ozone layer is earth's sunscreen, and it's really fragile. If you could take all of the ozone, which is mostly about\n10 to 20 miles up above our heads, and compress it down\nto the surface of the earth, it would form a thin shell\nonly about two pennies thick, about an eighth of an inch. And that thin shell does\nan amazing amount of work, though. It filters out more than 90 percent\nof the harmful UV radiation coming from the sun. And while I'm sure many of you\nenjoy that suntan that you get from the remaining 10 percent,\nit causes a lot of problems: cataracts, damage to crops, damage to immune systems and also skin cancer. It's not an exaggeration to say that a threat to the ozone layer\nis a threat to human safety. And actually, ironically,\nit was human safety that motivated the invention\nof CFCs in the first place. You see, in the early days\nof refrigeration, refrigerators used toxic\nand flammable chemicals like propane and ammonia. For good reason,\nthe refrigeration industry wanted a safe alternative, and they found that in 1928, when a scientist named Thomas Midgley synthesized the first\ncommercially viable CFCs. And in fact, Midgley famously\ninhaled CFCs and blew out a candle to demonstrate,\nat a scientific conference, that they were safe and nonflammable. And in fact, as a scientist,\nI can tell you there is no way you could get away\nwith that kind of antic today. I mean, wow. But really, at the time, CFCs were a really remarkable invention. They allowed what we now know\nas modern-day refrigeration and air-conditioning and other things. So it wasn't actually until\nover 40 years later, in the 1970s, when scientists realized that CFCs\nwould break down high in the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer. And this finding really set off\na lot of public concern. It led, ultimately, to the banning\nof CFC usage in aerosol spray cans in the US and a few\nother countries in 1978. Now, the story doesn't end there, because CFCs were used\nin much more than just spray cans. In 1985, scientists discovered\nthe Antarctic ozone hole, and this was a truly alarming discovery. Scientists did not expect this at all. Before the Antarctic ozone hole, scientists expected\nmaybe a five or 10 percent reduction in ozone over a century. But what they found\nover the course of less than a decade was that more than a third of the ozone\nhad simply vanished, over an area larger\nthan the size of the US. And although we now know that CFCs\nare the root cause of this ozone hole, at the time, the science\nwas far from settled. Yet despite this uncertainty, the crisis helped spur nations to act. So that quote that I started\nthis talk with, about the Montreal Protocol,\nfrom President Reagan -- that was his signing statement\nwhen he signed the Montreal Protocol after its unanimous ratification\nby the US Senate. And this is something\nthat's truly worth celebrating. In fact, yesterday was the 30th\nanniversary of the Montreal Protocol. (Applause) Because of the protocol, ozone-depleting substances\nare now declining in our atmosphere, and we're starting to see the first signs\nof healing in the ozone layer. And furthermore, because many\nof those ozone-depleting substances are also very potent greenhouse gases, the Montreal Protocol\nhas actually delayed global warming by more than a decade. That's just wonderful. But I think it's worth\nasking the question, as we face our current\nenvironmental crisis, global warming, what lessons can we learn from Montreal? Are there any? I think there are. First, we don't need\nabsolute certainty to act. When Montreal was signed, we were less certain then\nof the risks from CFCs than we are now of the risks\nfrom greenhouse gas emissions. A common tactic that people\nwho oppose climate action use is to completely ignore risk\nand focus only on uncertainty. But so what about uncertainty? We make decisions in the face\nof uncertainty all the time, literally all the time. You know, I'll bet those of you\nwho drove here tonight, you probably wore your seat belt. And so ask yourself, did you wear your seat belt\nbecause someone told you with a hundred percent [certainty] that you would get\nin a car crash on the way here? Probably not. So that's the first lesson. Risk management and decision making\nalways have uncertainty. Ignoring risk and focusing\nonly on uncertainty is a distraction. In other words, inaction is an action. Second, it takes a village\nto raise a healthy environment. The Montreal Protocol wasn't just\nput together by industry and governments or environmental advocacy\ngroups and scientists. It was put together by all of them. They all had a seat at the table, and they all played\nan important role in the solution. And I think in this regard, we're actually seeing\nsome encouraging signs today. We see not just environmental groups\nconcerned about climate change but also civic and religious groups, the military and businesses. So wherever you find yourself\non that spectrum, we need you at the table, because if we're going\nto solve global warming, it's going to take actions at all levels, from the individual to the international and everything in between. Third lesson: don't let the perfect\nbe the enemy of the good. While Montreal has become the brake pedal\nfor stopping ozone depletion, at its beginning, it was more\njust like a tap on the brakes. It was actually the later\namendments to the protocol that really marked the decision\nto hit the brakes on ozone depletion. So to those who despair that the Paris Climate Accord\ndidn't go far enough or that your limited actions on their own\nwon't solve global warming, I say don't let the perfect\nbe the enemy of the good. And finally, I think it helps us\nto contemplate the world we've avoided. Indeed, the world we have avoided\nby enacting the Montreal Protocol is one of catastrophic changes to our environment\nand to human well-being. By the 2030s, we'll be avoiding millions\nof new skin cancer cases per year with a number that would only grow. If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough\nto see the end of this animation and to see the ozone hole\nrestored to its natural state. So as we write the story\nfor earth's climate future for this century and beyond, we need to ask ourselves,\nwhat will our actions be so that someone can stand on this stage in 30 or 50 or a hundred years to celebrate the world\nthat they've avoided. Thank you. (Applause)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Brian Little is more interested in moments when we transcend those traits — sometimes because our culture demands it of us, and sometimes because we demand it of ourselves.

(Laughter) I\'ve had the opportunity\nover the last couple of days of listening in on some\nof your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it\'s fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms\nI would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might\nlike to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you\na few facts and stories, in which you may catch\na glimpse of yourself. I\'m in the field of research\nknown as personality psychology, which is part of a larger\npersonality science which spans the full spectrum,\nfrom neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may\nbe saying of yourself, ""I\'m not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person\nin the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people\nas a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness\nand your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist,\nreally fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches\nin personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions\nwhich are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects\nof difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more\nlackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast\nto more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those\ndecidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have\nimplications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness\nare very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success\nthrough being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people\nachieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as\nhaving some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness\nare both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example,\nI find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes\ngive them a basic fact that might be revealing\nwith respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually\nimpossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried\nto lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those\nwho have not only tried, but they have successfully\nlicked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail\nwith extroversion, because it\'s consequential\nand it\'s intriguing, and it helps us understand\nwhat I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature --\nour neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural\nand social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you\nindividually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes\nextroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved\nby finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties\nand social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts\nforming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I\'ve seen you. The introverts are more likely\nto spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able\nto reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued\nas being antisocial, but you\'re not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize\nthat you do better when you have a chance\nto lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it\'s an internal\nstimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better\nwith extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office\nat nine o\'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they\'re not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks\nthey\'re engaged in -- and they\'ve had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they\'re quantitative, introverts may give the appearance\nof not being particularly quantitative. But it\'s a misconstrual. So here are the consequences\nthat are really quite intriguing: we\'re not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which\nindividuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female;\nintrovert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I\'m sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle\nall the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently,\nextroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter\npunctuated by closeness. They\'d like to stand close\nfor comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms\nwhen they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,""\nand then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he\'s given\na pass to be more intimate by the person he\'s talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white,\nconcrete, simple language. Introverts prefer --\nand I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert\nas you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract\nI shared with a colleague who\'s as different from me\nas two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn\'t. (Laughter) Secondly, he\'s six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he\'s as extroverted\na person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can\'t even have a cup of coffee\nafter three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project\na fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought\nthe project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him\nasked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I\'ll tell you\nwhat Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears\nheard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have\na tendency at times of behaving in a way\nthat some of us might see as perhaps more assertive\nthan is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that\'s what I said: he\'s an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain\n""assholic"" qualities in this man\'s behavior, but I\'m not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks\nlike one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something\nthat we should be heedful of? Of course. It\'s important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we\'re not. Remember, you\'re like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion\nor your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively\nElizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you\nbetter than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you\'re\na certain type of person. I\'m uncomfortable putting\npeople in pigeonholes. I don\'t even think pigeons\nbelong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It\'s the doings that we have\nin our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you\'ve been back three times\nto the hospital, and they still don\'t know what\'s wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you\'d been acting out of character. These are free traits. You\'re very agreeable,\nbut you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers\nof administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something\nfor your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They\'re where we enact a script in order to advance\na core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don\'t ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core\nprojects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I\'m an introvert, but I have a core project,\nwhich is to profess. I\'m a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can\'t wait to tell them\nabout what\'s new, what\'s exciting, what I can\'t wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement\nto keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find\nthat we don\'t take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period\nof pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured\nthe strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men\'s room to escape the slings and arrows\nof outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day\nwhen I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came\nin beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various\nevacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that\'s why we flush\nduring as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard\nthis gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed\nto constipate an introvert for six months, it\'s talking on the john. (Laughter) That\'s where I\'m going now. Don\'t follow me. Thank you. (Applause)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And she called, and she said, ""I\'m really struggling with how\nto write about you on the little flyer."" And I thought,\n""Well, what\'s the struggle?"" And she said, ""Well, I saw you speak, and I\'m going to call you\na researcher, I think, but I\'m afraid if I call you\na researcher, no one will come, because they\'ll think\nyou\'re boring and irrelevant."" (Laughter) And I was like, ""Okay."" And she said, ""But the thing\nI liked about your talk is you\'re a storyteller. So I think what I\'ll do\nis just call you a storyteller."" And of course, the academic,\ninsecure part of me was like, ""You\'re going\nto call me a what?"" And she said, ""I\'m going\nto call you a storyteller."" And I was like, ""Why not \'magic pixie\'?"" (Laughter) I was like, ""Let me think\nabout this for a second."" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know,\nI am a storyteller. I\'m a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that\'s what I do. And maybe stories\nare just data with a soul. And maybe I\'m just a storyteller. And so I said, ""You know what? Why don\'t you just say\nI\'m a researcher-storyteller."" And she went, ""Ha ha.\nThere\'s no such thing."" (Laughter) So I\'m a researcher-storyteller,\nand I\'m going to talk to you today -- we\'re talking about\nexpanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you\nand tell some stories about a piece of my research\nthat fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed\nthe way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher,\ndoctoral student, my first year, I had\na research professor who said to us, ""Here\'s the thing, if you cannot\nmeasure it, it does not exist."" And I thought he was just\nsweet-talking me. I was like, ""Really?""\nand he was like, ""Absolutely."" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor\'s\nand a master\'s in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,\nso my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of\nbelieved in the ""life\'s messy, love it."" And I\'m more of the, ""life\'s messy,\nclean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."" (Laughter) And so to think that I had found my way,\nto found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayings\nin social work is, ""Lean into the discomfort of the work."" And I\'m like, knock discomfort\nupside the head and move it over and get all A\'s. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what,\nthis is the career for me, because I am interested\nin some messy topics. But I want to be able\nto make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things\nthat I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time\nyou\'re a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection\nis why we\'re here. It\'s what gives purpose\nand meaning to our lives. This is what it\'s all about. It doesn\'t matter whether\nyou talk to people who work in social justice,\nmental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection,\nthe ability to feel connected, is -- neurobiologically\nthat\'s how we\'re wired -- it\'s why we\'re here. So I thought, you know what,\nI\'m going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation\nfrom your boss, and she tells you 37 things\nthat you do really awesome, and one ""opportunity for growth?"" (Laughter) And all you can think about\nis that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way\nmy work went as well, because, when you ask people about love,\nthey tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they\'ll tell you their most excruciating\nexperiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me\nwere about disconnection. So very quickly -- really about six weeks\ninto this research -- I ran into this unnamed thing\nthat absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn\'t understand\nor had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need\nto figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood\nas the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that,\nif other people know it or see it, that I won\'t be worthy of connection? The things I can tell you about it: It\'s universal; we all have it. The only people who don\'t experience shame have no capacity for human\nempathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it,\nthe more you have it. What underpinned this shame,\nthis ""I\'m not good enough,"" -- which, we all know that feeling: ""I\'m not blank enough.\nI\'m not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough,\nsmart enough, promoted enough."" The thing that underpinned this\nwas excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order\nfor connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves\nto be seen, really seen. And you know how I feel\nabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measuring stick. I\'m going in, I\'m going\nto figure this stuff out, I\'m going to spend a year,\nI\'m going to totally deconstruct shame, I\'m going to understand\nhow vulnerability works, and I\'m going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know,\nit\'s not going to turn out well. (Laughter) You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I\'d have to borrow\neveryone else\'s time. But here\'s what I can tell you\nthat it boils down to -- and this may be one of the most important\nthings that I\'ve ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds\nof long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were\nsending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is\nwhat shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory,\nbut something was not okay -- and what it was is that, if I roughly\ntook the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really\nhave a sense of worthiness -- that\'s what this comes down to,\na sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense\nof love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering\nif they\'re good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense\nof love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging believe they\'re worthy\nof love and belonging. That\'s it. They believe they\'re worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing\nthat keeps us out of connection is our fear that we\'re not\nworthy of connection, was something that,\npersonally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took\nall of the interviews where I saw worthiness,\nwhere I saw people living that way, and just looked at those. What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction,\nbut that\'s another talk. So I had a manila folder,\nand I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going\nto call this research? And the first words that came\nto my mind were ""whole-hearted."" These are whole-hearted people,\nliving from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top\nof the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day,\nvery intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews,\nthe stories, pulled the incidents. What\'s the theme? What\'s the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this\nJackson Pollock crazy thing, where I\'m just writing\nand in my researcher mode. And so here\'s what I found. What they had in common\nwas a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage\nand bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original\ndefinition of courage, when it first came\ninto the English language -- it\'s from the Latin word ""cor,""\nmeaning ""heart"" -- and the original definition was to tell\nthe story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply,\nthe courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind\nto themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can\'t practice compassion\nwith other people if we can\'t treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection,\nand -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go\nof who they thought they should be in order to be who they were,\nwhich you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had\nin common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them\nvulnerable made them beautiful. They didn\'t talk about vulnerability\nbeing comfortable, nor did they really talk\nabout it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier\nin the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness\nto say, ""I love you"" first ... the willingness to do something\nwhere there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe\nthrough waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They\'re willing to invest\nin a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged\nallegiance to research, where our job -- you know, the definition of research\nis to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit\nreason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer\nthat the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown -- (Laughter) -- which actually looked more like this. (Laughter) And it did. I call it a breakdown; my therapist\ncalls it a spiritual awakening. (Laughter) A spiritual awakening\nsounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away\nand go find a therapist. Let me tell you something:\nyou know who you are when you call your friends and say,\n""I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?"" Because about five\nof my friends were like, ""Wooo, I wouldn\'t want\nto be your therapist."" (Laughter) I was like, ""What does that mean?"" And they\'re like,\n""I\'m just saying, you know. Don\'t bring your measuring stick."" (Laughter) I was like, ""Okay."" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana -- I brought in my list of the way\nthe whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, ""How are you?"" And I said, ""I\'m great. I\'m okay."" She said, ""What\'s going on?"" And this is a therapist\nwho sees therapists, because we have to go to those,\nbecause their B.S. meters are good. (Laughter) And so I said, ""Here\'s the thing,\nI\'m struggling."" And she said, ""What\'s the struggle?"" And I said, ""Well, I have\na vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability\nis the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it\'s also\nthe birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem,\nand I need some help."" And I said, ""But here\'s the thing:\nno family stuff, no childhood shit."" (Laughter) ""I just need some strategies."" (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So she goes like this. (Laughter) And then I said, ""It\'s bad, right?"" And she said, ""It\'s neither good nor bad."" (Laughter) ""It just is what it is."" And I said, ""Oh my God,\nthis is going to suck."" (Laughter) And it did, and it didn\'t. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability\nand tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that\'s not me, and B: I don\'t even hang out\nwith people like that. (Laughter) For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand\nwhat they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making,\nand what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling\nwith vulnerability? No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability -- when we\'re waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out\non Twitter and on Facebook that says, ""How would you\ndefine vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?"" And within an hour and a half,\nI had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what\'s out there. Having to ask my husband for help\nbecause I\'m sick, and we\'re newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal\nwith it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there\'s evidence -- and it\'s not the only reason\nthis evidence exists, but I think it\'s a huge cause -- We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated\nadult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is -- and I learned this\nfrom the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can\'t say, here\'s the bad stuff. Here\'s vulnerability,\nhere\'s grief, here\'s shame, here\'s fear, here\'s disappointment. I don\'t want to feel these. I\'m going to have a couple of beers\nand a banana nut muffin. (Laughter) I don\'t want to feel these. And I know that\'s knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. (Laughter) You can\'t numb those hard feelings without numbing\nthe other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking\nfor purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers\nand a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think\nwe need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn\'t just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make\neverything that\'s uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief\nin faith and mystery to certainty. ""I\'m right, you\'re wrong. Shut up."" That\'s it. Just certain. The more afraid we are,\nthe more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There\'s no discourse anymore. There\'s no conversation. There\'s just blame. You know how blame\nis described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there\'s anyone who wants their life\nto look like this, it would be me, but it doesn\'t work. Because what we do is we take fat\nfrom our butts and put it in our cheeks. (Laughter) Which just, I hope in 100 years,\npeople will look back and go, ""Wow."" (Laughter) And we perfect,\nmost dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think\nabout children. They\'re hardwired for struggle\nwhen they get here. And when you hold those perfect\nlittle babies in your hand, our job is not to say,\n""Look at her, she\'s perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team\nby fifth grade and Yale by seventh."" That\'s not our job. Our job is to look and say, ""You know what? You\'re imperfect,\nand you\'re wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."" That\'s our job. Show me a generation\nof kids raised like that, and we\'ll end the problems,\nI think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do\ndoesn\'t have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate -- whether it\'s a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we\'re doing doesn\'t have a huge impact\non other people. I would say to companies,\nthis is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic\nand real and say ... ""We\'re sorry. We\'ll fix it."" But there\'s another way,\nand I\'ll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen,\ndeeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts,\neven though there\'s no guarantee -- and that\'s really hard, and I can tell you as a parent,\nthat\'s excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy\nin those moments of terror, when we\'re wondering,\n""Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?"" just to be able to stop and, instead of\ncatastrophizing what might happen, to say, ""I\'m just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable\nmeans I\'m alive."" And the last, which I think\nis probably the most important, is to believe that we\'re enough. Because when we work from a place,\nI believe, that says, ""I\'m enough"" ... then we stop screaming\nand start listening, we\'re kinder and gentler\nto the people around us, and we\'re kinder and gentler to ourselves. That\'s all I have. Thank you.

132,0,How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change | Allan Savory,"""""Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,"""" begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality, and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology, and that\'s very understandable. Now, this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population, rising towards 10 billion people, land that is turning to desert, and, of course, climate change. Now there\'s no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change. Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert, and this happens only when we create too much bare ground. There\'s no other cause. And I intend to focus on most of the world\'s land that is turning to desert. But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine. We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year. On those, it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground. No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly. And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness, and that is where desertification is occurring. Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space, and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. Generally, what you see in green is not desertifying, and what you see in brown is, and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying. I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters -- that\'s an inch of rain -- was falling. Think of it in terms of drums of water, each containing 200 liters. Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day. The next day, the land looked like this. Where had that water gone? Some of it ran off as flooding, but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again, exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. Now, because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter, when we damage soils, you give off carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Now you\'re told over and over, repeatedly, that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world, and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence. But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them, you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you\'ve just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae, leading to increased runoff and evaporation. That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock, mostly cattle, sheep and goats, overgrazing the plants, leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. Almost everybody knows this, from nobel laureates to golf caddies, or was taught it, as I was. Now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments in Africa where I grew up, and I loved wildlife, and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. Well, I have news for you. We were once just as certain that the world was flat. We were wrong then, and we are wrong again. And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. When I was a young man, a young biologist in Africa, I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting, drum-beating people to protect the animals, than the land began to deteriorate, as you see in this park that we formed. Now, no livestock were involved, but suspecting that we had too many elephants now, I did the research and I proved we had too many, and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain. Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make, and it was political dynamite, frankly. So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research. They did. They agreed with me, and over the following years, we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage. And it got worse, not better. Loving elephants as I do, that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life, and I will carry that to my grave. One good thing did come out of it. It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions. When I came to the United States, I got a shock, to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa. And there\'d been no livestock on this land for over 70 years. And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural. So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification, but I found the opposite, as we see on this research station, where this grassland that was green in 1961, by 2002 had changed to that situation. And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to ""unknown processes."" Clearly, we have never understood what is causing desertification, which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally. We have never understood it. Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here, and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it\'s just covered with litter, plant litter. You have changed the microclimate. Now, by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world\'s land, you are changing macroclimate. But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago? Why has it accelerated lately? We had no understanding of that. What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world, the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals, and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators. Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds, and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals. Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food, and they have to keep moving, and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants, while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil, as we see where a herd has passed. This picture is a typical seasonal grassland. It has just come through four months of rain, and it\'s now going into eight months of dry season. And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. Now, all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season, and if it doesn\'t, the grassland and the soil begin to die. Now, if it does not decay biologically, it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process, and this smothers and kills grasses, leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil, releasing carbon. To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire. But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon, and worse than that, burning one hectare of grassland gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants than 6,000 cars. And we are burning in Africa, every single year, more than one billion hectares of grasslands, and almost nobody is talking about it. We justify the burning, as scientists, because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow. Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry, what could we do to keep that healthy? And bear in mind, I\'m talking of most of the world\'s land now. Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change. What are we going to do? There is only one option, I\'ll repeat to you, only one option left to climatologists and scientists, and that is to do the unthinkable, and to use livestock, bunched and moving, as a proxy for former herds and predators, and mimic nature. There is no other alternative left to mankind. So let\'s do that. So on this bit of grassland, we\'ll do it, but just in the foreground. We\'ll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature, and we\'ve done so, and look at that. All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung, urine and litter or mulch, as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand, and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain, to store carbon, and to break down methane. And we did that, without using fire to damage the soil, and the plants are free to grow. When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification, I was faced with a real dilemma. How were we to do it? We\'d had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals, but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world. Then we\'d had 100 years of modern rain science, and that had accelerated desertification, as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States, and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government. Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals, and humans, over thousands of years, had never been able to deal with nature\'s complexity. But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this. So rather than reinvent the wheel, I began studying other professions to see if anybody had. And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need, and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing, a planning process, and that does address all of nature\'s complexity and our social, environmental, economic complexity. Today, we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds, plan their grazing to mimic nature, and where we have them hold their animals overnight -- we run them in a predator-friendly manner, because we have a lot of lands, and so on -- and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields, we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well. Let\'s look at some results. This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe. It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year, and it\'s going into the long dry season. But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it, has evaporated from the soil surface. Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended, and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid. Now let\'s go to our land nearby on the same day, with the same rainfall, and look at that. Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. It\'s fine. The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife, everything is now more productive, and we have virtually no fear of dry years. And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent, planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo, giraffe and other animals that we have. But before we began, our land looked like that. This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got. Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. This was another site where it had been bare and eroding, and at the base of the marked small tree, we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay? And again, watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature. And there are fallen trees in there now, because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc. This land in Mexico was in terrible condition, and I\'ve had to mark the hill because the change is so profound. (Applause) I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland, and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. And look at the amazing change in this one, where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature, and once more, we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying. The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher, and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers. They put 25,000 sheep in one flock, really mimicking nature now with planned grazing, and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year. We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture. Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals. I remind you that I am talking about most of the world\'s land here that controls our fate, including the most violent region of the world, where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land. What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as, I believe, fossil fuels, and maybe more than fossil fuels. But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty, violence, social breakdown and war, and as I am talking to you, millions of men, women and children are suffering and dying. And if this continues, we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing, even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels. I believe I\'ve shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents, and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that, for illustrative purposes, if we do what I am showing you here, we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years, and if we just do that on about half the world\'s grasslands that I\'ve shown you, we can take us back to pre-industrial levels, while feeding people. I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet, for your children, and their children, and all of humanity. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, Chris. Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have, and I\'m sure everyone here has, A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you. I\'m just going to ask you one quick question. When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals, it\'s desert. What do they eat? How does that part work? How do you start? Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time, and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation, where it\'s 100 percent bare. But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe, where I offered a £5 note in a hundred-mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred-mile drive, and on that, we trebled the stocking rate, the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding, just by the movement, mimicking nature, and using a sigmoid curve, that principle. It\'s a little bit technical to explain here, but just that. CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea. The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful. CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk, and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way. Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1. I\'ve also lived in Biosphere 2. And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres. And hopefully from that I get to learn something. So what did I learn? Well, here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza. So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough. And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese. It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza. Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes, because I pick up the phone and I call and say, ""Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"" So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre, entirely sealed, miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes. (Laughter) Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass, underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed. So we had our own miniature rainforest, a private beach with a coral reef. We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert. We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything. And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived. Back in the mid-\'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2, we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean, what is a biosphere? Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right? Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you\'re going to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material -- and energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is. This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen, walked in, to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we\'d put in there to hopefully keep him alive, the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin, or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus. But of course none of that happened. And over the ensuing few years, there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2. But by 1991 we finally had this thing built. And it was time for us to go in and give it a go. We needed to know, is life this malleable? Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale, and jam it into a little bottle, and will it survive? Big questions. And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance, would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it? We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in. Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby. Let\'s take it on a maiden voyage. Will it work? Or will something happen that we can\'t understand and we can\'t fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres? So eight of us went in: four men and four women. More on that later. (Laughter) And this is the world that we lived in. So, on the top, we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean, and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it, which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that. One of the Biospherians called it ""garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier."" And then also we had the human habitat of course, with the laboratories, and all of that. This is the agriculture. It was essentially an organic farm. The day I walked into Biosphere 2, I was, for the first time, breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world, except seven other people. At that moment I became part of that biosphere. And I don\'t mean that in an abstract sense; I mean it rather literally. When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing. And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes. (Laughter) And those sweet potatoes became part of me. In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again. I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. When it came to our atmosphere, however, it wasn\'t that much of a joke over the long term, because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen. And we knew that we were losing CO2. And so we were working to sequester carbon. Good lord -- we know that term now. We were growing plants like crazy. We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement, growing plants, going around, around, around, trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere. We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere. We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could. We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air. But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected, because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module. And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek. We had lost seven tons of oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent -- my goodness, do you feel dreadful. I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere. And we had sleep apnea at night. So you\'d wake up gasping with breath, because your blood chemistry has changed. And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) -- take a breath and it wakes you up. And it\'s very irritating. And everybody outside thought we were dying. I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying. And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, ""No, Mum, it\'s fine, fine. We\'re not dead. We\'re fine. We\'re fine."" And the doctor was, in fact, checking us to make sure we were, in fact, fine. But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. And one day he couldn\'t add up a line of figures. And it was time for us to put oxygen in. And you might think, well, ""Boy, your life support system was failing you. Wasn\'t that dreadful?"" Yes. In a sense it was terrifying. Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time, if it really got bad, though who was going to say, ""I can\'t take it anymore!""? Not me, that was for sure. But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project, because we could really crank this baby up, as a scientific tool, and see if we could, in fact, find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone. And we did indeed find it. And we found it in the concrete. Essentially it had done something very simple. We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost. It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air; it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete. Pretty straightforward really. So at the end of the two years when we came out, we were elated, because, in fact, although you might say we had discovered something that was quite ""uhh,"" when your oxygen is going down, stopped working, essentially, in your life support system, that\'s a very bad failure. Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it. And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that. And we proved the concept, more or less. People, on the other hand, was a different subject. We were -- yeah I don\'t know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts, I will say. And the day I came out of Biosphere 2, I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends. For two years I\'d been seeing people through the glass. And everybody ran up to me. And I recoiled. They stank! People stink! We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant, and all kinds of stuff. Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean, but nothing with perfume. And boy do we stink out here. Not only that, but I lost touch of where my food came from. I had been growing all my own food. I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from. I didn\'t even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating. In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops, reading all the names on all of the things. People must have thought I was nuts. It was really quite astonishing. And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in. In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday, and it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally. So I went about my business: Paragon Space Development Corporation, a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere, because I had nothing else to do. And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres, and what can you do with them? And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station, for 16 months, where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are. And I\'m also proud to announce that you\'re getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we\'re going to announce that we\'re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon, which is going to be pretty fun. And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing: an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars. And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system. As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places, in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa. Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia, is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful, incredibly stark, and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there. It is so dry. This is what I saw. But this is also what I saw. I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand, and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it. And it will produce a food crop. In this case it was oilseed. It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves in a plantation. And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals, so that they could produce milk and whatnot, like we had in the Biosphere. And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms. Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth, frankly, from an environmental point of view. They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. They also pollute their next-door neighbors. So they\'re all shitting each other\'s ponds, quite literally. And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these, and turning them into all of this food. They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people. They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense. I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program, under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol system. And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp, I was thinking to myself, ""How do you put a box around this?"" When I\'m modeling a plant in a box, literally, I know where to draw the boundary. In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth. And understand its interactions with the entire Earth. And put your project in that context. Around the world today we\'re seeing an incredible transformation, from what I would call a biocidal species, one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time. This is in fact, this beautiful photograph, is in fact over the Amazon. And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation. And those beautiful wispy clouds are, in fact, fires, human-made fires. We\'re in the process of transforming from this, to what I would call a biophilic society, one where we learn to nurture society. Now it may not seem like it, but we are. It is happening all across the world, in every kind of walk of life, and every kind of career and industry that you can think of. And I think often times people get lost in that. They go, ""But how can I possibly find my way in that? It\'s such a huge subject."" And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. This is the story of a rake in my backyard. This was my backyard, very early on, when I bought my property. And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down. And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out, and I want to throttle them. It\'s a certain type of aesthetic. We\'re very uncomfortable with untidiness. And I threw away my rake. And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property. And over time, essentially what have I been doing? I\'ve been building topsoil. And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks. And I have an oasis. This is what happens every spring. For six weeks, six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis. This is actually in a riparian area. And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake. The small stuff counts. The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus -- has given us this, the ability to light up the world. It has also given us this, the ability to look at the world from the outside. Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to, and compare it to this biosphere. But we can look at the world, and try to understand where we are in its context, and how we choose to interact with it. And if you lose where you are in your biosphere, or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere, I would say to you, take a deep breath. The yogis had it right. Breath does, in fact, connect us all in a very literal way. Take a breath now. And as you breathe, think about what is in your breath. There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you. Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. It also connects us in time. There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs. There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren. Thank you.

134,0,What I learned from going blind in space | Chris Hadfield,"There's an astronaut saying: In space, """"there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse."""" So how do you deal with the complexity, the sheer pressure, of dealing with dangerous and scary situations? Retired colonel Chris Hadfield paints a vivid portrait of how to be prepared for the worst in space (and life) -- and it starts with walking into a spider's web.

Or another way to say it is, what\'s the most dangerous \nthing that you\'ve ever done? And why did you do it? I know what the most dangerous thing is that I\'ve ever done because NASA does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches, the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight, the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40. Not great odds, so it\'s a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you\'re going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you\'re either going to be floating \neffortlessly, gloriously in space, or you\'ll be dead. You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center, the suit-up room, the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in, that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad -- in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad, and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center, it\'s normally predawn, and in the distance, lit up by the huge xenon lights, is your spaceship -- the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet. The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed, almost holding hands, looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger. We ride the elevator up and we crawl in, on your hands and knees into the spaceship, one at a time, and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed, and suddenly, what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real, something that I dreamed about, in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old, is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening. In the astronaut business -- the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle; it\'s the most complicated flying machine ever built. And in the astronaut business, \nwe have a saying, which is, there is no problem so bad that you can\'t make it worse. (Laughter) And so you\'re very conscious in the cockpit; you\'re thinking about all of the things that you might have to do, all the switches and all the \nwickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer and closer, this excitement is building. And then about three and a \nhalf minutes before launch, the huge nozzles on the back, like the size of big church bells, swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle, like the vehicle is alive underneath you, like an elephant getting up \noff its knees or something. And then about 30 seconds before launch, the vehicle is completely alive -- it is ready to go -- the APUs are running, the computers are all self-contained, it\'s ready to leave the planet. And 15 seconds before launch, this happens: (Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six -- (Space shuttle preparing for takeoff) -- start, two, one, booster ignition, and liftoff of \nthe space shuttle Discovery, returning to the space station, paving the way ... (Space shuttle taking off) Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things. You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It\'s shaking you so hard you can\'t focus on the instruments in front of you. It\'s like you\'re in the jaws of some enormous dog and there\'s a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space, accelerating wildly straight up, shouldering your way through the air, and you\'re in a very complex place -- paying attention, watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face. After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines, the hydrogen and oxygen, and it\'s as if you\'re in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you\'ve never accelerated. You get lighter and lighter, the force gets on us heavier and heavier. It feels like someone\'s pouring cement on you or something. Until finally, after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so, we are finally at exactly the right altitude, exactly the right speed, the right direction, the engine shut off, and we\'re weightless. And we\'re alive. It\'s an amazing experience. But why would we take that risk? Why would you do something that dangerous? In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me, it was just an obvious thing -- I want to somehow turn myself into that. But the real question is, how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it? How do you deal with fear versus danger? And having the goal in mind,\nthinking about where it might lead, directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible, to be able to launch and go \nhelp build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that\'s going around the world at five miles a second, eight kilometers a second, around the world 16 times a day, with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside. But maybe even more importantly, allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means, to be able to look down and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would -- the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic, constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see, because of the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit, and you\'re going through space with the world. It\'s an entirely different perspective, you\'re not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going \nthrough the universe together. And you\'re holding on with one hand, looking at the world turn beside you. It\'s roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything, it\'s unfathomable blackness, with a texture you feel like you \ncould stick your hand into. and you are holding on with one hand, one link to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind, and I didn\'t know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn\'t figure out why my eye wasn\'t working. I was thinking, what do I do next? I thought, well maybe that\'s why we have two eyes, so I kept working. But unfortunately, without gravity, tears don\'t fall. So you just get a bigger and \nbigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually, the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it \nacross the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes ""goosh"" into your other eye, and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. So what\'s the scariest thing you\'ve ever done? (Laughter) Maybe it\'s spiders. A lot of people are afraid of spiders. I think you should be afraid of spiders -- spiders are creepy and they\'ve got long, hairy legs, and spiders like this one, the brown recluse -- it\'s horrible. If a brown recluse bites you, you end with one of these \nhorrible, big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you, in fact. And how do you know? And so a spider lands on you, and you go through this great, spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say, well \nis there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not? I don\'t know. Are there brown recluses here? So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about \n50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000. And if you\'re in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there\'s about 720, \n730 different types of spiders and there\'s one -- one -- that is venomous, and its venom isn\'t even fatal, it\'s just kind of like a nasty sting. And that spider -- not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it\'s like ""I\'m dangerous. I got a big radiation \nsymbol on my back, it\'s the black widow."" So, if you\'re even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider -- and it lives close the ground, you\'re walking along, you are \nnever going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this, it doesn\'t build those, it builds them down in the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn\'t care about you. So in fact, the next time you walk into a spiderweb, you don\'t need to panic and go \nwith your caveman reaction. The danger is entirely different than the fear. How do you get around it, though? How do you change your behavior? Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure \nit\'s not a black widow spider, and then walk into it. And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. It\'s just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It\'s not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is \nno more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you \nwalk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior, your caveman reaction, and you will now be able to walk \nin the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb -- or into your grandma\'s attic or whatever, into your own basement. And you can apply this to anything. If you\'re outside on a spacewalk and you\'re blinded, your natural reaction would be to panic, I think. It would make you nervous and worried. But we had considered all the venom, and we had practiced with a whole \nvariety of different spiderwebs. We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times. And we don\'t just practice things going right, we practice things going wrong all the time, so that you are constantly walking \nthrough those spiderwebs. And not just underwater, but \nalso in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it\'s realistic. So when you finally actually \nget outside on a spacewalk, it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you\'re blinded, your natural, panicky reaction doesn\'t happen. Instead you kind of look around and go, ""Okay, I can\'t see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over and help me."" We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue, so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to. I could find my own way back. It\'s not nearly as big a deal. And actually, if you keep on crying for a while, whatever that gunk was that\'s \nin your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again, and Houston, if you negotiate with them, they will let you then keep working. We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside, Jeff got some cotton batting and took \nthe crusty stuff around my eyes, and it turned out it was just the anti-fog, sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye. And now we use Johnson\'s No More Tears, which we probably should\'ve been using right from the very beginning. (Laughter) But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger, where is the real risk? What is the real thing that you should be afraid of? Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. You can fundamentally change \nyour reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... where you could see the \nhardpan south of the Sahara, or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike, or the unconscious gingham \nof Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles. You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge, just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. It\'s time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship, the Soyuz, that little one. Three of us climb in, and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere. These two parts here actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere. The only part that survives is the little bullet that we\'re riding in, and it falls into the atmosphere, and in essence you are riding a meteorite home, and riding meteorites is scary, and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth -- (Laughter) -- instead, 20 years previously we had started studying Russian, and then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian, and then we learned vehicle control theory, and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact, you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So in fact, when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz, we weren\'t screaming, we were laughing; it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened, we knew that if it didn\'t open there\'s a second parachute, and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back, we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan. (Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters, once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi-8 helicopters. Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds, a.m. Central Time. CH: And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your \nspaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end, but you\'re ready for it you\'re in a custom-built seat, you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach in, drag you out, plunk you into a chair, and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy, which were impossible and dauntingly scary, dauntingly terrifying, and put them into practice, and figured out a way to reprogram yourself, to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song, and it\'s really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself, but it\'s also, I think, a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe, we are people, and we\'re taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place.

I\'m going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper\nin The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. I\'m going to go way out on a limb and say\nthat it is the most diverting paper ever published in\nThe Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine. The title is ""Observations\nof In-Utero Masturbation."" (Laughter) Okay. Now on the left you can see\nthe hand -- that\'s the big arrow -- and the penis on the right.\nThe hand hovering. And over here we have, in the words of radiologist\nIsrael Meisner, ""The hand grasping the penis in a fashion\nresembling masturbation movements."" Bear in mind this was an ultrasound, so it would have been moving images. Orgasm is a reflex\nof the autonomic nervous system. Now, this is the part\nof the nervous system that deals with the things\nthat we don\'t consciously control, like digestion, heart rate\nand sexual arousal. And the orgasm reflex can be triggered\nby a surprisingly broad range of input. Genital stimulation. Duh. But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm\nby having someone stroke her eyebrow. People with spinal cord injuries, like paraplegias, quadriplegias, will often develop a very,\nvery sensitive area right above the level of their injury, wherever that is. There is such a thing\nas a knee orgasm in the literature. I think the most curious one\nthat I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time\nshe brushed her teeth. (Laughter) Something in the complex\nsensory-motor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm. And she went to a neurologist,\nwho was fascinated. He checked to see\nif it was something in the toothpaste, but no -- it happened with any brand. They stimulated her gums with a toothpick,\nto see if that was doing it. No. It was the whole, you know, motion. And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman\nwould have excellent oral hygiene. (Laughter) Sadly -- this is what it said\nin the journal paper -- ""She believed that she was\npossessed by demons and switched to mouthwash\nfor her oral care."" It\'s so sad. (Laughter) When I was working on the book, I interviewed a woman\nwho can think herself to orgasm. She was part of a study\nat Rutgers University. You\'ve got to love that. Rutgers. So I interviewed her in Oakland,\nin a sushi restaurant. And I said, ""So, could you\ndo it right here?"" And she said, ""Yeah, but you know I\'d rather\nfinish my meal if you don\'t mind."" (Laughter) But afterwards, she was kind enough\nto demonstrate on a bench outside. It was remarkable.\nIt took about one minute. And I said to her, ""Are you just doing this all the time?"" (Laughter) She said, ""No. Honestly, when I get home,\nI\'m usually too tired."" (Laughter) She said that the last time\nshe had done it was on the Disneyland tram. (Laughter) The headquarters for orgasm,\nalong the spinal nerve, is something called the sacral nerve root, which is back here. And if you trigger,\nif you stimulate with an electrode, the precise spot,\nyou will trigger an orgasm. And it is a fact that you can trigger\nspinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person,\na beating-heart cadaver. Now this is somebody who is brain-dead, legally dead, definitely checked out, but is being kept alive on a respirator, so that their organs will be oxygenated\nfor transplantation. Now in one of these brain-dead people, if you trigger the right spot, you will see something every now and then. There is a reflex called\nthe Lazarus reflex. And this is -- I\'ll demonstrate\nas best I can, not being dead. It\'s like this. You trigger the spot. The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that. Very unsettling for people\nworking in pathology labs. (Laughter) Now, if you can trigger\nthe Lazarus reflex in a dead person, why not the orgasm reflex? I asked this question\nto a brain death expert, Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough\nto return my emails. (Laughter) I said, ""So, could you conceivably\ntrigger an orgasm in a dead person?"" She said, ""Yes, if the sacral nerve\nis being oxygenated, you conceivably could."" Obviously it wouldn\'t be\nas much fun for the person. But it would be an orgasm -- (Laughter) nonetheless. There is a researcher\nat the University of Alabama who does orgasm research. I said to her,\n""You should do an experiment. You know? You can get cadavers\nif you work at a university."" I said, ""You should actually do this."" She said, ""You get the human subjects\nreview board approval for this one."" (Laughter) According to 1930s marriage manual author, Theodoor van De Velde, a slight seminal odor can be detected\non the breath of a woman within about an hour\nafter sexual intercourse. Theodoor van De Velde was something\nof a semen connoisseur. (Laughter) This is a guy writing a book,\n""Ideal Marriage,"" you know. Very heavy hetero guy. But he wrote in this book,\n""Ideal Marriage"" -- he said that he could differentiate\nbetween the semen of a young man, which he said had a fresh,\nexhilarating smell, and the semen of mature men,\nwhose semen smelled, quote, ""Remarkably like that of the flowers\nof the Spanish chestnut. Sometimes quite freshly floral, and then again sometimes\nextremely pungent."" (Laughter) Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel,\na man began hiccupping. And this was one of those cases\nthat went on and on. He tried everything his friends suggested. Nothing seemed to help. Days went by. At a certain point, the man,\nstill hiccupping, had sex with his wife. And lo and behold, the hiccups went away. He told his doctor,\nwho published a case report in a Canadian medical journal\nunder the title, ""Sexual Intercourse as a Potential\nTreatment for Intractable Hiccups."" I love this article because\nat a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers\ncould try masturbation. (Laughter) I love that because there is like a whole\ndemographic: unattached hiccuppers. (Laughter) Married, single, unattached hiccupper. In the 1900s, early 1900s, a lot of gynecologists believed\nthat when a woman has an orgasm, the contractions serve to suck\nthe semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it\nreally quickly to the egg, thereby upping the odds of conception. It was called the ""upsuck"" theory. (Laughter) If you go all the way back to Hippocrates, physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful\nfor conception, but necessary. Doctors back then\nwere routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives. Marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer\nTheodoor van De Velde -- (Laughter) has a line in his book. I loved this guy. I got a lot of mileage\nout of Theodoor van De Velde. He had this line in his book that supposedly comes\nfrom the Habsburg Monarchy, where there was an empress Maria Theresa, who was having trouble conceiving. And apparently the royal\ncourt physician said to her, ""I am of the opinion that the vulva\nof your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time\nprior to intercourse."" (Laughter) It\'s apparently, I don\'t know,\non the record somewhere. Masters and Johnson: now we\'re moving forward to the 1950s. Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics, which is also really fun to say. They didn\'t buy it. And they decided,\nbeing Masters and Johnson, that they would get to the bottom of it. They brought women into the lab\n-- I think it was five women -- and outfitted them with cervical caps\ncontaining artificial semen. And in the artificial semen\nwas a radio-opaque substance, such that it would show up on an X-ray. This is the 1950s. Anyway, these women\nsat in front of an X-ray device. And they masturbated. And Masters and Johnson looked to see\nif the semen was being sucked up. Did not find any evidence of upsuck. You may be wondering,\n""How do you make artificial semen?"" (Laughter) I have an answer for you.\nI have two answers. You can use flour and water,\nor cornstarch and water. I actually found three\nseparate recipes in the literature. (Laughter) My favorite being the one that says -- you know, they have\nthe ingredients listed, and then in a recipe\nit will say, for example, ""Yield: two dozen cupcakes."" This one said, ""Yield: one ejaculate."" (Laughter) There\'s another way that orgasm\nmight boost fertility. This one involves men. Sperm that sit around in the body\nfor a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective\nat head-banging their way into the egg. British sexologist Roy Levin\nhas speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic\nand frequent masturbators. He said, ""If I keep tossing myself off\nI get fresh sperm being made."" Which I thought\nwas an interesting idea, theory. So now you have an evolutionary excuse. (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) All righty. There is considerable evidence\nfor upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs, for instance. In Denmark, the Danish National Committee\nfor Pig Production found out that if you\nsexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her, you will see a six-percent increase\nin the farrowing rate, which is the number of piglets produced. So they came up with this five-point\nstimulation plan for the sows. There is posters they put in the barn,\nand they have a DVD. And I got a copy of this DVD. (Laughter) This is my unveiling,\nbecause I am going to show you a clip. (Laughter) So, okay. Now, here we go, la la la, off to work. It all looks very innocent. He\'s going to be doing things\nwith his hands that the boar would use\nhis snout, lacking hands. Okay. (Laughter) This is it. The boar has a very odd\ncourtship repertoire. (Laughter) This is to mimic the weight of the boar. (Laughter) You should know, the clitoris\nof the pig is inside the vagina. So this may be\nsort of titillating for her. Here we go. (Laughter) And the happy result. (Applause) I love this video. There is a point in this video,\ntowards the beginning, where they zoom in for a close up\nof his hand with his wedding ring, as if to say,\n""It\'s okay, it\'s just his job. He really does like women."" (Laughter) Okay. When I was in Denmark,\nmy host was named Anne Marie. And I said, ""So why don\'t you just\nstimulate the clitoris of the pig? Why don\'t you have the farmers do that? That\'s not one of your five steps."" I have to read you\nwhat she said, because I love it. She said, ""It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch\nunderneath the vulva. So we thought, let\'s not mention\nthe clitoris right now."" (Laughter) Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however,\ncan purchase a -- this is true -- a sow vibrator, that hangs on the sperm\nfeeder tube to vibrate. Because, as I mentioned,\nthe clitoris is inside the vagina. So possibly, you know,\na little more arousing than it looks. And I also said to her, ""Now, these sows. I mean,\nyou may have noticed there. The sow doesn\'t look to be\nin the throes of ecstasy."" And she said, you can\'t make\nthat conclusion, because animals don\'t register\npain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do. Pigs, for example, are more like dogs. They use the upper half of the face;\nthe ears are very expressive. So you\'re not really sure\nwhat\'s going on with the pig. Primates, on the other hand,\nwe use our mouths more. This is the ejaculation face\nof the stump-tailed macaque. (Laughter) And, interestingly, this has been\nobserved in female macaques, but only when mounting another female. (Laughter) Masters and Johnson. In the 1950s, they decided,\nokay, we\'re going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle, from arousal, all the way through orgasm,\nin men and women -- everything that happens in the human body. Okay, with women,\na lot of this is happening inside. This did not stop Masters and Johnson. They developed an artificial\ncoition machine. This is basically\na penis camera on a motor. There is a phallus, clear acrylic phallus,\nwith a camera and a light source, attached to a motor\nthat is kind of going like this. And the woman would have sex with it. That is what they would do.\nPretty amazing. Sadly, this device has been dismantled. This just kills me,\nnot because I wanted to use it -- I wanted to see it. (Laughter) One fine day, Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance\ntraveled by ejaculated semen. This was not idle curiosity. Doctor Kinsey had heard -- and there was a theory going around\nat the time, this being the 1940s -- that the force with which\nsemen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility. Kinsey thought it was bunk,\nso he got to work. He got together in his lab 300 men, a measuring tape,\nand a movie camera. (Laughter) And in fact, he found\nthat in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out. It wasn\'t spurted or thrown\nor ejected under great force. However, the record holder landed just shy of the eight-foot mark,\nwhich is impressive. (Laughter) (Applause) Yes. Exactly. (Laughter) Sadly, he\'s anonymous.\nHis name is not mentioned. (Laughter) In his write-up\nof this experiment in his book, Kinsey wrote, ""Two sheets were laid down to protect\nthe oriental carpets."" (Laughter) Which is my second favorite line\nin the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey. My favorite being, ""Cheese crumbs\nspread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female,\nbut not the male."" (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thanks!']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

every vital commodity is fallen we're seeing a lot of these markets hit coronavirus has oil below $50 a barrel US demand in China has dropped off substantially you're impacted demand for copper iron or even gold is going down America's Department of Labor has recorded the highest ever number of new and employment claims in the past two weeks just under 10 million government's had modeled the impact of a pandemic on their economies but when in no way prepare the indication is that economic activity has been sledge-hammered in the course of a couple of points just how deep is the crisis for the world economy over the past two months the world's biggest stock markets have turned red it falls like that because investors certainly have to recalculate the future for the economy and the future of corporate profits and adjust their figures sharply downwards and then they tend to sell assets which are the most liquid often those are the big companies in the S&P 500 the S&P 500 had its quickest bear market decline in history when the.com bubble burst in 2000 it took almost two years for the S&P 500 to drop by 49 percent the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis led to a fall of almost 60 percent in just over a year the corona virus pandemic has already seen the market fall by a third in just one month this class has been so quick because it was such a shock in the financial crisis there was actually quite a long lead-up it was a good long 18 months of bad news but this is genuinely a deus ex machina a bolt from the blue where investors and were just not pricing in the risk of a pandemic and of course governments have never in the past imposed the kind of lockdown on a global economy that they have this time so this was not something people had in their models in an effort to stop the deadly virus businesses have been forced to close and citizens isolated at home on an unprecedented scale worldwide it's caused a unique economic crisis the impact of which will be greater on some industries in particular the industries which are hit hardest are those which are related to the consumer so that's retailing that's entertainment that's hospitality both hotels and restaurants many of which have simply been locked down and many of these companies will have high costs which they'll need to keep meeting so certainly you have lots of cost continuing and absolutely no revenues which is the worst possible outcome for these businesses but even if a business isn't directly losing out from people staying at home lockdowns are having a devastating ripple effect modern industry relies on goods and materials crossing borders when they can't production around the world is endangered the coronavirus caused a break in the biggest link in this vast global supply chain the problem started in China where the disease started really to be seen in December and then had a huge impact in January China is the bedrock of the global supply chain businesses started to look for alternative suppliers but of course that was a race to try and find the few that had spare capacity as the virus spread alternative suppliers have become fewer and further between it's going to take a very very long time for them to rebuild their supply chains and in the interim was very little demand for finished products a few companies are going to want to resurrect that supply chain instantly until they know that the economy has settled down the true extent of the damage to the world economy will only start to become clear with the speed and strength of its recovery the big questions that economists are still trying to grapple with is whether this is what they call a v-shaped recession or or a u-shaped position or an l-shaped recession in a v-shape recession the economy suffers a rapid fall but rebounds very quickly as opposed to a longer economic trough before recovery or long term recession now the most encouraging news we've had so far is that in China which was the first economy to be hit and the latest figures suggest the most hopeful possibility which is that this is a v-shaped recession now if China can do that the hope is that Europe and America can do that later on when the lock downs are lifted Europeans and Americans are also being helped by unprecedented government responses 330 billion pounds 2.2 trillion dollars and urgently needed relief these short-term protections might reduce the damage the economy suffers but this pandemic could last a long time so the difficult calculation for governments is trading off the lives of people who will die from the coronavirus versus the economic damage to the economy year-long lock downs would cost America and the eurozone perhaps 1/3 of their GDP models looking at America suggest that ending lock downs would lessen that damage but would lead to around 1 million extra deaths in the last 75 years since the second world war we've seen nothing like this governments have not reacted on the scale so although it's terrible in a way it shows our humanity that we want to reduce the number of deaths so much that we're willing to put up with all these restrictions and well willing to accept a big hit to economic activities I'm Philip Coggan I'm reporting for The Economist on the financial crisis that's been created by the pandemic if you want to read more click on the link opposite and thank you for

137,0,China’s Vanishing Muslims: Undercover In The Most Dystopian Place In The World,"China’s Uighur minority live a dystopian nightmare of constant surveillance and brutal policing. At least one million of them are believed to be living in what the U.N. described as a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy,” while many Uighur children are taken to state-run orphanages where they're indoctrinated into Chinese customs.The Uighurs' plight has largely been kept hidden from the world, thanks to China’s aggressive attempts to suppress the story at all costs.VICE News’ Isobel Yeung posed as a tourist to gain unprecedented access to China’s western Xinjiang region, which has been nearly unreachable by journalists.She and our crew experienced China’s Orwellian surveillance and harassment first-hand during their time in Xinjiang, and captured chilling hidden-camera footage of eight Uighur men detained by police in the middle of the night. We spoke with members of the Uighur community about their experience in these camps, and about China’s attempts to silence their history and lifestyle under the cover of darkness.Subscribe to VICE

ethnic separatism their response to detain over 1 million people in massive new facilities where they're taken for so-called re-education the government has presented these as joyful training schools where they're correcting extremist behavior for the US Defense Department has called them concentration camps in an effort to clamp down on information leaking out of the region journalists have been

should be a little bit more lacks traveling around the region but it doesn't mean that there's about a million people trying to get on a train we had the outside the main city Regas are essentially living in open prisons in places where surveillance is even tighter so we took a 17 hour train ride to the ancient city of kashgar to find out if that rang true we splurged on a sleeper cabin which we

was at the same time that China began sending hundreds of thousands of weaker adults to the camps we identified several more compounds in Houghton all built around the same time and with the same

140,0,Why some Asian accents swap Ls and Rs in English,"A linguistic stereotype, explained. This video is presented by Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/Vox/Thank you the Video Lab members (Janet, Martian, and Mariko) who helped me with this video.

A foreign accent is when someone speaks a second language with the rules of their first language, and one of the most persistent and well-studied foreign-accent features is a lack of L/R contrast among native Japanese speakers learning English. It’s so well-known that American soldiers in World War II reportedly used codewords like “lallapalooza” to distinguish Japanese spies from Chinese allies. But American movies and TV shows have applied this linguistic stereotype to Korean and Chinese characters too, like Kim Jong Il in Team America: World Police, or Chinese restaurant employees singing “fa ra ra ra ra” in A Christmas Story. However, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese  are completely different languages that each handle L-sound and R-sounds differently. In this episode of Vox Observatory, we take a look at each language and how it affects pronunciation for English-language learners.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines. Check out http://www.vox.com.Watch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyEFollow Vox on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06oOr Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H",Vox,2yzMUs3badc,"['There’s a saying in Hong Kong kung fu movies: “Wai faai bat po.” It means ""only speed is unbreakable."" “Wai faai bat po.” That’s in Cantonese, a language with tones, which English speakers have trouble distinguishing.\nSo when an American says that phrase with the wrong tones— “wifi bat po”—you\nget a Cantonese meme. ""It became kind of a joke that people will\nsend to each other. It\'s like oh, this bad-ass wifi is so good. “Wai faai bat po.” It\'s\nquite funny. If English is your first language though,\nyou might be more familiar with a different joke: “Supplies!” That’s the notion that East Asians mix up\ntheir Rs and Ls in English: “Oh herro prease.” It’s a running gag in Lost in Translation, an Oscar-winning film about two Americans\nwho are sad in Japan. “Lat pack. You know lat pack?” “Rat?\nRat pack.” The movie makes communication with the locals\nseem hopeless. “Hey. Lip my stocking.” “Hey? Lip them?” And at one point Scarlett Johansson\'s character asks: ""Why do they switch the Rs and the L’s here?"" ""Oh, for yucks."" This movie may be a bit rrrrr— rude, but it’s not a terrible question to ask.\nBecause if you’re genuinely curious, a foreign accent gives us chance to learn something\nabout another language. So this trope has been applied to Japanese,\nKorean, and Chinese speakers. ""McFry!"" ""Herro."" ""Fa ra ra ra ra."" But, all of these languages deal with Rs and Ls in different ways. First though, we need to talk about the R sound in English. It turns out that there isn’t\njust one way to pronounce it. ""Oh it’s incredibly varied."" Eleanor Lawson uses ultrasound to study English phonetics.\n""You have trilled r’s which are sort of a rrr sound. You can probably hear my tapped\nr. So I do a ara sound. Varied. You can have a retroflex R where your tongue essentially\ncurls upside down under your palatal arch. ""Run. Run.""\nShe says the bunched-r, which is common in North American english, is particularly complex. ""Nurse. Nurse."" Say the word fur. Fur. How would you tell\nsomeone where to put their tongue to make that R? The middle of the tongue rises up in the mouth, while the root of the tongue is pulling backwards. You might have some lip rounding as well. R sounds like this, where the air flow isn’t\nblocked by the tongue or the lips, are called “approximates” in phonetics. ""So forming all of these structures at the same time could be very difficult for someone\nwho is not used to producing that."" The r-sound is one of the last consonants\nthat english-speaking kids learn to say. It takes up to 5 adorable years for them to figure\nit out. “Purple. And red” And the L-sound in English can change depending on its position in a word. Say the words “ladle”\nor “level.” That first L is a ""clear L."" You can probably\nfeel your tongue touching the top of the mouth, right behind your front teeth. As in “led.”\nBut the l at the end of the word is a “dark L,"" where the tip of the tongue might not\neven touch top of your mouth at all. ""A dark L is where the back of the tongue\nis moving up toward the soft palate and it gives it an o-ish sound like an ""Uhh O"". “Level.”\n“Level.” So the English R and L are complicated, but\nstill, ""Lat Pack,"" rrr, llll-- they seem like pretty different sounds. It might help to look at Spanish - say the word salero. “Salero. Salt Shaker.” “Salero”\n“Salero” This R is made with a flap of the tongue on\nthe ridge behind the front teeth - \xa0that’s not too far away from where the L is pronounced. Japanese has that R-sound. It doesn’t have\nthe lll in “lake” or the rrr in “red.” ""We have ra ri ru re ro, which sounds kind\nof similar to both L and R."" Those are the 5 syllables in Japanese that\ncontain the tongue-flap sound: “ra ri ru re ro"" Try saying them: “ra ri ru re\nro.” When they’re converted into the Latin alphabet,\nthey’re spelled like this, with the letter “r”. But the Japanese R-sound is actually\ncloser to our L-sound “la” than it is to the english ""ra.""\n""My name is Mariko and for all my english-speaking friends, their intuition to say is marie-ko.\nAnd how I explain to them is just imagine my name spelled with M-a-l-i-k-o and you should\nbe fine. When words migrate from English to Japanese,\nboth Rs and Ls become Japanese Rs. “Garasu.” “Karendaa.” “Boringu.” “Raito.” There are thousands of these loan words that Japanese speakers have to relearn with rrrs\nand llls, which are two sounds that Japanese ears weren’t tuned to distinguish in the first\nplace. Like Japanese, Korean doesn’t have the English\nrrr sound. They have this letter. It\'s ""rieul."" ""leer?"" ""lee-ul."" ""lee-er."" ""Ul."" ""Ul. Lee-ul."" ""Like my tongue is going straight up to the roof of my mouth. Ul. ""Rieul.""\nIt takes on a different sound depending on its position within the word.\nSo when it\'s followed by a vowel, it has the flap sound like a Japanese R. “Duriseo.\nDuriseo."" That also means it’s written with the letter “r” when converted into Latin\nscript. “Duriseo.” But when it’s at the end of a word or is followed by a consonant,\nit sounds more like an L-sound and it’s transcribed in the Latin alphabet as “L”. So it’s pretty unlikely that Korean speakers would say “herro” since their L-sound\ncan map on to the english L. But the “dark L” doesn’t exist in Korean.\n\xa0So when they’re new to english, Koreans might to use their own L sound in spots\nwhere we would use a dark L, near the end of words. \xa0“As the story unfolds, someone\nmay change the world.” There are at least 8 major Chinese languages,\nbut we’ll look at Mandarin and Cantonese. They both have a clear L sound. And it’s\nrestricted to the beginning of syllables. ""Leng. It’s like ‘pretty.’"" ""La. ‘drag.’"" So the notion that they would switch “fa la la"" into “fa ra ra” is just wrong and\nthe makers of a Christmas story should feel bad. Like Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese don\'t have the dark L sound as in “pull”. But\nwhen they come across an L near the end of a word in english, they tend pronounce it\nmore like a vowel. ""A hundred years old, 90 years old. I said\nwe should respect this kind of people."" ""He chose the coldest possible. Really."" Mandarin does have an r sound. At the beginning of a syllable it sounds like this: ""zrr. zrr.\nSo like actually, maybe the R sounds more like the S in ""treasure."" zrr Rènxìng.” And at the end of a syllable: ""er."" It means ""son."" Cantonese, on the other hand, doesn’t have an R sound at all. So when speaking English,\nthey sometimes use a w sound, or an L sound. ""We just tried very hard to prove ourselves."" Our ability to produce sounds in a new language\ndepends in part on whether those sounds are meaningfully distinct in our first language.\nSo a Japanese speaker hearing lll and rrr -- it’s a lot like an English speaker hearing\ntones in Chinese. ""Leng. Leng. Leng. Leng."" ""Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Yeah I know, people\'s minds\njust blown away."" We all carry the rules of our native language\nwith us when we learn new languages. ""Accent is your identity. So I don’t want\nto sound like an American person or British person."" So if you hear a foreign accent, remember that it’s a unique hybrid, it\'s like a lion with\nstripes — something you can only get if you’re brave enough to venture beyond the comfort\nof your mother tongue.

141,0,How Trump wins press conferences,"Trump has turned press conferences into a ritual of hate -- is it still worth watching?Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-labSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOThe White House press conference has always been a frustrating spectacle, with reporters trying to pry information from government officials who do everything in their power to avoid sharing too much information. But these press conferences are typically appreciated because of their symbolic value -- they reaffirm the democratic idea that the government must answer to the people.That symbolic value has changed under Trump, who uses press conferences to stage high profile fights with the press and mobilize his base.On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

""Let\'s go, let\'s go, come on."" ""If you don\'t mind, Mr. President, that this caravan wasn\'t an invasion."" Get him, Jim.\nHit him with the truth. ""Caravan was not an invasion, it\'s a group of migrants."" ""I consider it an invasion you and I have a difference of opinion."" Oh snap, you gonna let that slide Jim? ""Think you should let me run the country, you run CNN. If you did it well, your ratings would be much better."" Ohhhh hell yeah — Okay, look. I know I should . be rooting for Jim Acosta here, the brave\njournalists sticking it to the man asking tough questions day after day — ""The president of the United States should not refer to us as \'the enemy of the people.\' "" — but to be honest these press conferences feel kind of performative, like I\'m\nwatching professional wrestling or something. You\'ve got your villains — ""Our very great President Donald J. Trump ."" ""Hello, everybody."" — you\'ve got your trash-talking: ""He made a joke, maybe\nyou guys should get a sense of humor and try it sometime."" And you got your fighting — ""I\'m not finished. I\'m not finished, fake news."" So much fighting. [Numerous agitated exchanges] News networks have become obsessed with\nthese press conferences, airing them live like title fights in the middle of the\nday. ""Now all eyes are on the press briefing. We have Sarah Sanders starting\nto speak now. Oh, do we? Okay, perfect."" And recapping them once the chaos is over. ""Okay so that\nwraps up what is fair to say an epic briefing. We\'ve got a whole team of\nreporters and panelists that are ready to get to it with you."" Don\'t get me wrong,\nit\'s a lot of fun to watch. I have Jim Acosta\'s face tattooed on my butt just\nlike everyone else, but I can\'t remember the last time I learned something from\none of these. ""Can you give us a question?"" ""I am not going to give you a question."" ""You are fake news."" And it\'s got me wondering: do we care\nabout these things because they\'re important or because they put on a\nreally good? ""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome: Donald Trump!"" I could do this video in a typical\nboring Strikethrough format, but this episode is about spectacles goddamnit so\nwe\'re gonna put on a freaking show and by that I mean a no-holds-barred cage\nmatch between two experts who\'ve done a lot of thinking about this issue. In one corner, the academic: NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen AKA Jackhammer Jay. Nobody calls me that. In the other corner, the veteran former White House\nreporter for The Associated Press, Jennifer Loven AKA The Heartbreaker. I don\'t think I can do it. The debate: has the White House press briefings become a spectacle? Jay, you\'re up\nfirst. Well the briefing has always been problematic since television came to it.\nThe presence of the cameras means that there\'s a temptation towards\nself-dramatization and theatrical confrontation sort of for its own sake. A brutal opening statements, let\'s see how Loven deals with that: I would disagree\nwith the notion that it\'s that much more of a spectacle now than it used to be. Wait what? It is a show and it\'s a show for the White House and it\'s a show for\nthe reporters who are sitting in the room. No, it\'s not a double-kill they\'re\nbasically agreeing with each other. Goddamn it you guys. Okay, forget the cage\nmatch thing. DOMINA — I said forget it. So it turns out, nobody really loves the White House\npress conferences. The White House hates them because they have to answer tough\nquestions from reporters ""Are you worried at all that you\'ve lost control of the process on how this bill\'s received?"" And reporters hate them because the White House does\neverything in its power to avoid answering those questions. ""I don\'t have an update for you."" ""I don\'t have any information with which to answer that\nquestion."" ""I appreciate the invitation to get involved in here, but I\'m not gonna RSVP."" They bring out random guests to stall for time, ""I have two special guests\ntalk to you about a new ruling on labels for cigarettes."" They punt questions to\nother agencies. ""I\'d refer you to the State Department on that."" ""I\'d refer you to HHS."" ""I will refer you to the Postal Service."" You never really get the big gotcha\nmoments you\'re hoping for. The whole thing is like pulling teeth. Every administration uses not only the briefing, but every tool at their disposal to go\naround the media. So the briefing is really no different. Trying to get\ninformation from a White House that doesn\'t want to give it to you unless\nthey want to give it to you. These press events became even more of a\nspectacle after Eisenhower introduced\ncameras in 1955. ""Motion picture cameras join newspaper reporters for an historic\npresidential press conference."" Once everyone could watch these things on TV, it became much more about putting on a good show. ""I see we\'re trying a new experiment\nthis morning. I hope it doesn\'t prove to be a disturbing influence."" It did. So if nobody\'s really getting what they want out of these press conferences, why\ndo we pay so much attention to them? Why air them on TV at all? Rosen has a theory. One way we could look at the White House briefing is that it\'s much more of a\nritual act of communication, than it is transmitting information. Rituals like\nthe White House press conference are intended to show that there is some\naccountability there, that the president has to answer questions, respond to doubts. And this is one way in which American power legitimates itself and in\ndemocratic system. You can\'t really see it here, but my brain lit up when he said\nthat because that ritual theory, it kind of makes everything click. And in ritual, you\'re not trying to move information. Instead, you reaffirm values, you\nadvertise the community what it believes in. We don\'t care about the press\nconference because it\'s important, it\'s important because we care about it. Because\nthey affirm this idea that the government has to answer to the public. The ideal of the briefing is that you have this operation in which you get a\nchance to ask questions of people who run the most powerful office in the\nworld. That is accountability and that is important, even if the execution isn\'t\nperfect. Which is why we pay so much attention when the White House clashes\nwith reporters. ""What was it like inside that very tense briefing room today?"" To those of us at home it looks like accountability. ""Why were you holding back\nthis information? This is directly relevant. Why did you hold it back?"" The term that journalists had for this is ""sparring,"" they loved the idea of sparring\nwith the officeholder. They\'re showing how they are the Accountability Police, which is a fascinating image because it suggests boxing, but it\'s\nreally boxing when you\'re practicing, it\'s like play-acting in a way. Kind of like wrestling? Which brings us back to this: ""That\'s enough. That\'s enough. That\'s. Enough."" The thing about symbolic rituals like this is they only work if everyone agrees\nthey\'re important. If both sides can respect each other enough to keep the\nritual going. If a professional wrestler starts trying to actually murder their\nopponent in the ring, the whole ritual falls apart. The same is true for these\npress conferences. Journalists don\'t like to talk about this, but there\'s always\nbeen a necessary level of cooperation. Person in power has to agree that is\nimportant to hold me to account. Trump doesn\'t agree with that. ""I called the fake\nnews the enemy of the people and they are. They are the enemy of the people."" His political strategy is built on attacking the press as illegitimate and dangerous,\nbut instead of abandoning the press conference altogether,\nTrump has transformed it into a platform for staging high profile fights with the\npress. ""You\'re very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible."" Now the ritual has turned into a ritual of hate. The press has become a hate object and the\nbriefing actually assists in that. For Trump, the point of the ritual isn\'t\naccountability, it\'s to create an enemy. To give viewers at home a visual of a\nbad guy to root against. ""See when you talk about division, it\'s people like\nthis that cause division. Great division."" From a PR standpoint it\'s a great\nstrategy. Trump can attack the media on Twitter all day, but these press\nconferences turn that anger into a real visceral image, one that gets looped on\nTV screens across the country. ""We also have highlights from the president\'s\nsmackdown of CNN\'s Jim Acosta."" ""The president smacking down mainstream media\nfor fake news."" ""They\'re very fake news. That\'s right."" I\'m a hundred percent sure he relishes the\nback-and-forth and understands that with a certain segment of his base, it helps\nhim. Trump has taken other steps to make these press conferences as dramatic as\npossible. The White House is having fewer press briefings now than it used to.\nThese lines represent the number of press briefings Obama and Bush held\nwhile in office and this little guy down here is Trump. Which means when the White\nHouse does have a press conference, Trump knows everyone is watching. ""It\'s very good to have you here, because a free press —"" ""I do too. Actually I do too."" ""It\'s called \'earned media.\' It\'s worth billions, go ahead."" These briefings are getting shorter too. The average White House Q&A is\nnow well under 20 minutes, which forces reporters to fight dramatically for\nquestions before time runs out. [Various reporters struggling to ask questions] is a staple of Hollywood movies and television shows. When you have these confrontations, it\nhelps him cement his support with his core supporters. ""Did you see the insane\ngrandstanding and the White House press briefing today? He was badgered by some\nmembers of the national left-wing media. I don\'t know how you do your job."" Important understand that in symbolic politics, people not only identify with\nthe leader, but they identify against the opponent. [Crowd chanting ""CNN sucks.""] Which explains why, despite\nhating CNN, Trump and Sanders keep calling on Acosta press conference after\npress conference. They know he\'ll put on a good show. ""Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter?"" And the\ngenius of Trump strategy is it\'s really tempting to play along. For one, news\nnetwork\'s benefit from the spectacle too. If you\'re not a trump supporter, these\npress conferences still look like a fight between a good guy and a bad guy,\njust with the roles reversed. From the journalist\'s side, theater works by\nportraying a heroic battler for truth who says ""answer my question, you didn\'t\nanswer the question"" ""President, will you stop calling us the enemy of the people, sir?"" ""Will you stop calling the press the \'enemy of the people,\' sir?"" And that image is also\ndeeply ingrained in American culture. Which is why CNN keeps sending Acosta\nof these things and fixating on the White House\'s reaction. It\'s good PR. ""Well, Jake when they go low we keep doing our jobs."" ""That is our job, to ask these\nquestions. We here at CNN keep doing our job the president should start doing his."" But more than that, it feels good watching people yell at Trump and\nSanders when they lie. It\'s cathartic because we want to believe the ritual\nstill works, that the president can still be publicly shamed into telling the\ntruth. But can he? I think the most important yardstick we can use to\ndiscover whether these events are still worth it or not is, is the\npresident actually held accountable for anything? Is he being more disciplined by the confrontation with the facts that\njournalists are trying to state? If there\'s one thing we can say about the\nTrump administration, is that this sort of accountability to fact has completely\nfailed. That doesn\'t mean we should abandon the press conference altogether.\nThere\'s a ton of useful information reporters get out of these things when\nthey\'re not in WWE mode. I mean, I get that it feels like a spectacle when you\nsee the tense parts of it, but there\'s a lot of really prosaic day-to-day\ninformation gathering that has to happen on that beat. ""What is the US stance on Venezuela at this point?"" ""What will be executive order\nthat\'s coming out this afternoon?"" ""Is the president planning on pardoning Paul Manafort?"" Trying to gather a lot of, really, just logistical information about what is going to happen here in this building so we can be prepared to cover it properly. But we should ask if watching reporters and Trump scream at each other is\nactually that valuable anymore. ""We are awaiting the start of the White House\npress briefing and it should be quite a show."" If it\'s worth giving Trump the\ntitle fight he\'s looking for. ""I love this, I\'m having a good time doing it. The public gets it, you know. When I go to rallies, they turn around they start\nscreaming at CNN."" We can\'t make Trump care about the symbolic value of press conferences, but what we can do is avoid treating these things like a high-stakes\nstruggle between a hero and a villain. After all, nothing deflates a wrestling\nmatch more than one side refusing to take the bait. It\'s boring, it ruins the spectacle. And right\nnow, that might be our best option.

That\'s Todd Vanderwerff, Vox.com\'s culture\neditor. We got together to talk about makeover movies. You know the ones. ""Given the right look, the right boyfriend,\nbam, in six weeks she\'s the one being crowned prom queen."" For all that it gets made fun of, and justifiably\nmade fun of, I think Rachel Leigh Cook sells the makeover sells the makeover in She\'s All\nThat to the degree that I\'m like ""Okay, sure"" nobody noticed that she looked like Rachel\nLeigh Cook until now. One of the very first movies with a makeover\nas its central plotline was a film called Now, Voyager starring Bette Davis. Charlotte, played by Davis pretty much had\nevery single convention you see in makeover movies today. She was shy and nervous, she wore glasses,\nshe had a unibrow and after a brief stint in a sanatorium, she came out looking like\nreal winner. ""I\'ve lost over 25 pounds it won\'t fit!"" It\'s rooted in Cinderella it\'s rooted in any\nstory of the girl or the boy who discovers they are secretly royalty which is a famous\nfairytale convention. ""Me, a princess? Shut up!"" Alright, so there are a few things that always\nhappen in a makeover movie. 1. You have to establish that the girl or guy\nis invisible to the people around them or clumsy or both. 2. You have to find them a seemingly unattainable\nlove interest. "" Yeah see what\'d I tell you? Hot right?"" 3. Their friends convince them that the only\nway to get out of their shitty situation is a makeover. ""Let\'s do a makeover"" 4. The big reveal. ""She looks beautiful"" It\'s occasionally been\ngender flipped and you have the guy like does his hair a different way and suddenly everyone\nis like ""Oh wow, what a good looking guy!"" ""Yes yes, big improvement."" What I think is interesting about the makeover\nstory is that, at least in past 30 years, we don\'t want it to be that easy. Clueless is perfect for this. ""Sher\'s main thrill in life is a makeover\nokay it gives her a sense of control in a world full of chaos."" Clueless is based on the Jane Austen novel,\nEmma. It gets at some of her themes of social class\nand propriety and what women are allowed to be. The character that who needs the makeover\nbasically is Alicia Silver Stone\'s character. She doesn\'t realize that until the very end\nand like in someways the audience doesn\'t as well. It\'s a marvelously structured movie if you\nlook at it at that level. Let me just do a shout out the recent movie,\nThe Duff. ""How could you guys not tell me this whole\ntime that I was your ""Duff"" ""Your what?"" ""Your designated ugly fat friend."" The Duff really got understood that Mae Whitman\'s\ncharacter in that movie was not going to put on a pink prom dress and suddenly be Taylor\nSwift. She was always going to be kind of the quirky\nfunny girl. ""Are you wearing pajamas?"" ""Oh my God! You know, I get it Wesley! I\'m a disgusting, I\'m a swamp thing, I\'m a\nregular Bela Lugosi!"" The makeover was not about becoming someone\nthat was conventionally attractive to dudes, and more about becoming the kind of girl she\nwould be when was a junior in college and had sort of figured her shit out. ""With some intensive work, she\'ll be ready\nfor the world\'s finest trailer park."" Makeover movies aren\'t the most sophisticated\nstories in the world, but it\'s a trope that resonates with people. Teenagers constantly want to hear they\'re\nokay the way they are. That\'s ultimately what the makeover movie\nis about. It\'s about that when you put the glasses back\non and the prom dress comes off, you\'re dressed in your artsy pain spattered overalls, you\'re\nstill a worthwhile person.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,0,Fox News keeps breaking its own rules,"Sean Hannity appeared on stage at a Trump rally before the midterm elections. It's the latest example of Fox News’ transformation from right-wing news network into full-on Republican campaign operation. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail. On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

It was November 5th and the show was airing from a Trump rally\nin Missouri. It\'s election eve. We\'re in the great Show-Me State. How are we all doing? And while Hannity\'s show is always rah rah\nTrump, this one felt especially campaign-y. So much is at stake. In a few short hours... you ready? Hannity opened the show by running through a literal list of Trump\'s accomplishments, including gems like ""successful trip to Asia"" and ""drafted plan to defeat ISIS."" Well, you gotta to start somewhere. He listed the Democrats agenda if they won\nthe midterms, including -- of course -- open borders. He constantly repeated the phrase ""promises made, promises kept."" Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept."" Which, surprise surprise, was one of the GOP\'s\nmidterm slogans. Promises made, promises kept. And he tried to put on a brave face before the impending Blue Wave. So what are we going to see tomorrow? I mean, as far as I\'m concerned the polls\nare meaningless. They are meaningless. The show ended with Hannity privately interviewing\nTrump, in a coffin I think, and asking hardball questions like: ""you spent three and a half billion on the\nborder wall. And I know you\'re disappointed, you want the\nrest."" And that was the end of the show. But the weirdness was only beginning. See, a few days earlier, the Trump campaign announced that Hannity would be appearing as a special guest during\nthe rally. Hannity denied that he\'d appear on stage, claiming he was only going there to interview\nTrump. But a few minutes after Hannity\'s show finished\nairing... Let\'s get it over with, right? Sean Hannity, come on up. Sean Hannity. Promises made, promises kept. By the way, all those people in the back are\nfake news. That freaked a lot of people out, and not just because Hannity was literally\ncalling other Fox News reporters in the room fake\nnews. Fox News issued a statement saying they didn\'t condone talent participating in\ncampaign events and Hannity claimed the whole thing with a\ntotal surprise. The president, I had no idea. It was not planned. And then... nothing. The midterms came and went. Hannity went back to his show and that was\nit. Welcome to Hannity. Jam packed hour. What would have been an immediate firing on any other network was barely a PR blip\nfor Fox. Because as shocking as that whole fiasco might\nlook, it\'s just the latest example in how Fox News\nis transforming from a right-wing news network into a full blown campaign operation. You have the power to shock the world again. Just think of what it\'s going to be like to watch the corrupt media. They will lose their minds. I want to start off by saying this is not\na video about Fox News being too conservative. It is normal for journalists to have political\nbeliefs. Hannity is obviously a right-winger and I\nam obviously an antifa supersoldier. What\'s not normal is for news organizations to be directly involved in campaigns they\'re\ncovering. It\'s why you\'ve never seen Rachel Maddow give a stump speech for Democrats. It\'s unethical. Also that speech would be 45 minutes long and never get to the point. Not again. As an experiment, I asked my bosses if I could\nspeak at a Democratic campaign rally -- that I made up because they have too much\nfree time on my hands -- and here\'s what they said. No. Come on. Of course not. Why not? Because you\'re journalists. You\'re not working for a campaign. This is a pretty widely accepted rule in journalism and it\'s actually one that Fox News used to\nfollow. In 2010, Hannity spent a week promoting his\nappearance at a Tax Day Tea Party rally in Cincinnati. Tax Day, we will be in Cincinnati. And hopefully you can be a part of the studio\naudience. But after Fox News found out the rally organizers were using Hannity\'s appearance to sell tickets, they pulled the plug. NewsCorp. CEO Rupert Murdoch said ""I don\'t think we should be supporting the\nTea Party or any other party."" And that was the last time Fox News pretended\nto give a shit. In 2016, Hannity appeared in a bananas pro-Trump\ncampaign ad. And of course he\'s going to build that wall, he says he\'s going to have Mexico pay for\nit. Sean! You shot it on an iPhone? With a tucked in polo? If any other journalist did that they\'d be\nso ridiculously fired. But Fox News did not fire Hannity. Instead, they said they didn\'t know he was\nappearing in the ad and promised that he wouldn\'t do it again. And since then, the problem has exploded. Hannity now regularly appears at Republican\nfundraising and campaign events. Here he is campaigning for Ted Cruz in Texas. We need Ted Cruz now than ever. And for Ron Desantis in Florida. The media hates that I\'m here and I\'m like\n""too bad."" But it\'s not even just Hannity anymore. Pete Hegseth, who co-hosts Fox and Friends\non the weekend, has repeatedly spoken at GOP fundraisers. Here he is in Washington in 2017. Keep giving. Keep fighting. Don\'t apologize for President Trump. Here he is in Tennessee in April. Please write a bigger check than you thought you were going to write tonight. He does a ton of these. We are correct. That\'s why you\'re a Republican. Here\'s Fox host Laura Ingraham campaigning for Republican Kelli Ward in Arizona. Let\'s push her over the finish line. Let\'s get it done for Kelli. Right after Hannity got pulled on stage at\nthat Trump rally, another Fox host, Jeanine Pirro, also went\non stage. Get em\' out to vote for Donald Trump and all the people who are running for the\nRepublican Party. Pirro has bragged about speaking at GOP fundraisers\non TV. Last night, I was in Morgantown, West Virginia where I gave a speech at the annual Republican\nReagan Dinner. She\'s a constant fixture at GOP fundraisers\nacross the country. God, you gotta love that sorority pose, though. I\'m getting away with it! The problem goes deeper than Fox hosts appearing at these events. These campaigns are now slowly infecting Fox News programming. Before Hannity went onstage at that Trump\nrally, he went district by district attacking individual\nDemocrats. Liberal radical leftist incumbent Claire McCaskill. Radical leftist Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Democratic do-nothing Schumer Democrat Bill\nNelson. While endorsing Republican candidates. American hero Martha McSally. Bob Hugin. Marine. Semper Fi, Bob. Ted Cruz needs to be back in the U.S. Senate. It wasn\'t the first time he\'d done that. Hannity had been running that segment for\ndays before the midterms. We will point out 10 key races a night. So you know if it\'s your district that matters. Republican Mark Harris, he needs your help. We need that seat to stay Republican. And again, it\'s not just Hannity. If you call yourself a conservative and a\nRepublican, it\'s actually immoral not to vote for Donald\nTrump. Vote for the America that is great again. And the more comfortable Fox has gotten with\ncampaigning, the more GOP candidates are relying on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. Look at this softball interview Hannity did with GOP candidate Karin Housley in October. Karin Housley is with us. Karin, let\'s talk about Keith Ellison and\nthe double standard. Yeah. Thank you so much for having me, Sean. What the- That is not a question. That is a campaign stop. And Housley knew it. She immediately repackaged that interview\ninto a campaign ad. You can win this race. I believe tha- Lots of Republicans do this now. Clip Hannity\'s softball coverage and repackage it for their campaign. A former police chief, Eddie Edwards. I\'m with the police chief tonight. Republican challenger Wendy Rogers, in a district that President Trump only carried\nby one point. By the way good luck in your run for governor\ndown in South Carolina. I have a lot of friends down there. It\'s become cliche to mock Fox News as Trump\nTV or state propaganda. But what\'s happened over the past few years goes way beyond ideology. Congressman Desantis joins us now. Full disclosure, I did do town halls with\nhim. And I endorsed you and I don\'t regret it. Fox News is quietly allowing itself to evolve\ninto a massive, highly influential get-out-the-vote operation. Congressman Desantis, congratulations. I remember you and I talking after we did\nthat debate on Fox News and you were like ""you\'re not going to be behind much longer\nafter this."" And sure enough, I mean, we really pulled\nahead. The problem isn’t that Hannity got on stage\nat a campaign event. It\'s that Fox News is the campaign event. One that\'s becoming deeply embedded in the\nGOP\'s strategy for winning elections from here on out. So let me get this straight.

It's from the Blue\nBook Modeling Agency in 1945. It says Norma Jean, who you might also know as Marilyn Monroe, was in fact, a size 12. LYNN BOORADY: She was. but back in the 50s, a size 12 was very thin. That was a model. You know, a size 12 then would be about a size 6 now. Well, to be exact, she would be a size 8 at\nTopshop, 6 at Zara, and 4 to 6 at American Apparel. ..to actually show you the inconsistencies,\nI went shopping. I bought 3 jeans at 3 different stores, all\nin the same size. We’re already off to a bad start. These all look different. This is not a 4. This one is the one in the middle. This one fits! Hold up. It won’t zip. I give up. Let’s wind back a little bit. It was the Napoleonic wars and later\nthe Civil War in the US that demanded a sizing system for the mass production of clothing for the first time. It was for men’s uniforms. After that, men’s suit sizes were based\non the chest measurement and the rest was calculated accordingly, assuming that their bodies were in proportion. The demands for mass production of uniforms escalated and ready-made clothing became really popular. By the end of the nineteenth century, most\npeople were wearing ready-made clothes. In 1939, the US government funded statisticians\nto collect the weight and 58 measurements of 15,000 women. LYNN BOORADY: They only used white women, even\nthough they took measurements of women of color, they didn’t include them in the study\nor the calculations. The women who would’ve turned out for these studies were the poor women because they would be paid. So the data set even back then was possibly malnourished women, certainly poor women, and not very diverse group of women… and that’s what\nwe started with. They were looking for key measurements that\ncould predict the sizes of other parts of the body, the way chest sizes had for men. But women’s bodies, with variable breast\nand hip sizes, were much harder to summarize with a single number. So, the data was used to create a\nsystem in 1958 with sizes from 8 to 42, an arbitrary number based on bust size, combined\nwith a letter for height and a plus or minus for hips. The sizing chart was really unpopular, so\nthey made some updates, but finally in 1983 it was completely withdrawn. In the 1970s and 80s, companies started labeling the sizes down, and adding lower numbers like\n2, zero and now even double zero. So the waist measurement that used to be a\nsize 12 became an 8. LYNN BOORADY: Vanity sizing specifically, is when the size on the label is lowered artificially, in order to tempt to get somebody to buy\nthe garment. So you’re appealing to the person’s vanity. Sizing has become a marketing tool. LYNN BOORADY: I think it’s done because the women are getting bigger,\nwe’re just addressing that. When the first standardizing chart came out\nin 1958 it was mostly built out of malnourished, white women. Now, that there’s such a wide group of people\nto cover, the retailers are picking a certain group of people to sell to, honing in what\nworks with that group and what doesn’t. LYNN BOORADY: I think we’re more aiming for our own target markets. So, when Abercrombie & Fitch does their sizing,\nthey’re sizing to their target market not to me. We kept tweaking that information\nuntil we sold more garments and could lower the return rate. That means, even brands owned by the same company will have inconsistent sizes. A size 8 at Banana Republic will have the\nsame hip size as a size 2 at the Gap. So if you get frustrated while shopping…. LYNN BOORADY: It’s not you, it’s the industry, it’s not women’s bodies, we’re fine the way we are. They are just random numbers, they don’t\nmean anything. And if you don’t like your size just cut\nit out of your clothes.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,0,We measured pop music’s falsetto obsession,"From Justin Timberlake to the Bee Gees, we charted the popularity of men singing high.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIt’s nearly impossible to turn on the radio and not hear a male artist singing really high. Likely he’s a tenor, and more often than not he’ll sing in falsetto. Think Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Drake, Charlie Puth, Shawn Mendes, Adam Levine, Sam Smith ... the list goes on and on and on. This isn’t a trend — it has been the status quo for decades. Using the data diving know-how of The Pudding, and drawing on the expertise of Anthony Roth Costanzo, a professional opera singer, I dig into the world of the high male vocal range by tracking how pervasive it really is across the decades.

This one hasn’t either nor has this one. None of these have. That because I made them, along with Matt\nhere. My name is Matt Daniels and I'm a journalist\nat the Pudding, which is a publication for visually led storytelling. Well, mainly Matt made them, I just sent him\na bunch of emails. These charts are the result of a year long\nobsession I’ve had over a very specific trend I’ve noticed in music. Men singing really high. When I listen to the radio, I’ve come to\nexpect one thing. Male pop stars exploiting their upper register. Bruno Mars, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Charlie\nPuth, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Adam Lavine, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, Khalid,\nChildish Gambino, Frank Ocean, all of One Direction, BTS, Chris Martin, One Republic,\nand Sam Smith. I’m not the first person to pick up on this. In 2015 alone it seemed every guy was singing\nhigh. There was Jason Derulo “Just the thought of you, gets me so high\n(so high)” Maroon 5 “I’m right here, cause I need a little\nlove a little sympathy” And Justin Bieber “Yeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?” But maybe this fact is best illustrated by\nthis 10 week period on the Billboard Charts. When The Weekend battled for the top spot\nagainst Justin Bieber “And I know she'll be the death of me” “What do you mean?” And then Himself “I only call you when it's half past five” until finally his Michael Jackson inspired\nvoice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.” “Hello, It’s Me” Really the only way to know if this hypothesis\nholds up, though, is to crunch the numbers and quantify it. And that’s where Matt came in. It kind of fits a really good mold of the\nquestions that I really like, where we have a cultural question about vocal ranges and\nusage of falsetto and music and there is no perfect data set for that. We wanted to make a chart that showed how\nprevalent the male falsetto was in pop music, not just in the last 5 years, but as far back\nas we could go. That meant looking at music streaming services. Every streaming platform tags the millions\nof songs in their respective libraries with metadata, but each one does it a little differently. For example, Spotify has over 35 millions\nsongs in their library, but their metadata is algorithmically driven and pretty broad. Matt: some of it was around the tempo of music\nand how danceable it was or its somber or positive tone. Pandora, on the other hand has a smaller library,\nbut they are committed to very specific data. In their case it wasn’t algorithmically\ndriven. They were actually having humans review songs\nand say what its DNA, or what its genome was. The result is a library of 2 million songs\nwith up to 450 individual identifying markers. So that was interesting to me because falsetto\nand vocal range, while could be determined by a computer, often lends itself to the human\near because there is some subjectivity to it. So, we asked Pandora if they had vocal data. They did. And they shared it with us. So do you actually have available the original\ndataset that we received? Oh yeah yeah I can. Should I just bring that up? It's forty two thousand rows. The first entry is by George P. Watson from\n1911 He was a Yodeler. One hundred and eight years later and 42,948\nrows down we have the iconic high voice of Thom Yorke. Sudden words We’ll get to exactly how these are scored\nin a bit, but damn that’s a lot of songs. So what we said was “OK this is great to\nsee these forty three thousand songs but really we only care about songs that charted.” So we created a data set of the Billboard\nHot 100, a 28,000 song list of the 100 most popular songs in the US every week since 1958. and we went back to Pandora. And said we only really want the falsetto\ndata for these songs, and not only do we want the falsetto data, but we also\nneed data about the register. And a few other important things, like the\ngender of the person singing. It’s not just a matter of like putting\ninto their system and it spits out the falsetto data. We need to match the names of the songs and\nthe artists names to whatever Pandora has. Wait. So you have to do that manually? We write fancy programs to guess that there's\na match and confirm that there's a match. So with Matt’s fancy program we matched\n20,075 songs. So the biggest gap in the data is actually\nthe missing songs that aren't on streaming services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100\nand did have very valid falsetto data behind them. So in 1958 we have data for 50% of the songs\nthat charted. In 2018 we have data for 95% of the songs\nthat charted. The good thing though is, you think of an\naverage number one hit from 1958 - that's more likely to appear on Pandora than a song\nthat hit number 100 for one week. When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet,\nI immediately wanted to see how songs that I thought had a lot of falsetto had actually\nbeen scored. The first song that I looked for was Childish\nGambino’s “Redbone.” “If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh” His voice is super high and very memorable. Not only that, a lot of articles about this\nsong mentioned it had a lot of falsetto. To my astonishment, Pandora determined there\nwas no falsetto in the song, instead they said it was just sung in a high register This trend was most stark in the hard rock\nand heavy metal genres. Def Leppard’s “Rock of Ages” had a falsetto\nscore of zero but register score of 9 out of 10. I don't care if it takes all night\nI gonna set this town alight, come on Knowing this, let’s define what falsetto\nand vocal register actually are. To do that I’ve brought in an actual opera\nsinger. Hi I'm Anthony Roth Costanzo and I'm a countertenor\nand opera singer. Prove it. Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first. The voices starting from the bottom in the\nclassical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor, contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano. Countertenor is kind of a catch all term and\nit's a range that goes up and down. Most male pop stars today are tenors. That means their average range is somewhere\nbetween here and here. Pandora’s data scores vocal register - which\nmeasures a singers ability to go up and down their range consistently. A super high register Pandora rates songs from 0-10 from low to\nhigh. “Rock of Ages” ranked super high with\na 9 - Pharrell’s voice in “Get Lucky” was\ngiven an 8 “I’m up all night to get some, she’s\nup all night for good fun, I’m up all night to get lucky” As was Elton John in “Crocodile Rock” “I never knew me a better time and I guess\nI never will” So I think it's safe to say that between a\n7 and 8 is pretty high on the vocal register range. But it's not crazy. So when these artists want to access even\nhigher notes they’ll likely switch to their falsetto register. Falsetto is an Italian word which means “false\nlittle voice.” Falsetto is typically a technique ascribed\nto a male singer that switches from their chest voice to their head voice. Whenever you're going from chest voice - meaning\nthe speaking register - to head voice, there's often a little break because there are two\ndifferent sets of muscles handing off to each other, and that's how you yodel right. [demonstrates yodeling] And that's what yodeling\nis. George, you’re back! It’s not just Yodeling. It happens in pop all the time, though that\ntransition is often more invisible. Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chest\nvoice to falsetto when he says the word “decline” “A built-in remedy\nFor Kruschev and Kennedy At anytime an invitation\nYou can't decline” Okay so let me just pause for a second and\nsay that “falsetto,” as a term, has been around forever, but its definition has changed and\nevolved. Many vocal coaches would say that falsetto\nis that breathy, light sound you heard from Freddie Mercury. And they say the generic term “head voice”\nshould describe crisper, reinforced high notes. A perfect example of that is from this 90s\nclassic. “I knew I loved you before I met you. I knew I loved you.” That's amazing. I mean you know that's like a really well\nintegrated instrument. For your average music listener, aka me, the\ntechnical distinction between head voice and falsetto is less important than the fact that\nthey both just sound impossibly high. That brings us again to the scoring system. A 10 on the Pandora scale is a song that’s\nsung entirely in Falsetto “Staying alive” That’s pretty extreme, and according to our data set, it’s also pretty\nrare. So here’s the tricky determination I’ve\ngot to make. What falsetto score is enough to really define\na song. I think a good place to start is a song literally\ncalled “Falsetto” “Now I got her talking like this, in a falsetto. She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah” Pandora gave this song a 6 - in their ears,\nThe-Dream only used the technique moderately. This is where I could split hairs all day. Because while, yeah, The-Dream doesn’t use\na falsetto the whole time, the technique plays does play a central role in the track. The hook of the song, the most memorable part,\nis sung in falsetto. Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River”\nalso got a 6. “Cry me a river (go on and just)\nCry me a river (go on and just) Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)” So, I’m going to look at songs with a falsetto\nabove a 5 If there’s one thing I can’t stress enough,\nit’s that this data can be addressed in a 1,000 different ways. To keep things simple, though we’ve separated\nfalsetto and vocal register as two separate data points. I think this is probably the first chart I\nmade that just was super simple and just said all right “What is the average value of\nall the songs that charted in a year.” First let's focus on vocal register. I was not expecting to see this just a very\nclear like march to the top in the late 80s The average vocal register for male singer\nin 1988 was a 7.1. But as you can see across any time period,\nthat average never really dropped below 5.4. Because there were so many songs in 1988 that\nhad a register of 7 or higher, we’re going to make this a little bit tougher. I’m going to boost the register to an 8\nand only allow songs that made it in the top 10. We’ve got a strong hard rock and heavy metal\nshowing. “She's got a smile it seems to me” There’s my man Phil Collins “I'm always right there beside her\nWe're two hearts” I’ve literally never heard this song “I can rocket 2 u” Okay, wow. If we push the Falsetto score up to a 6, we’re\nleft with just two songs from 1988. “Smooth Criminal”\n“He came into her apartment He left the bloodstains on the carpet” and “Nite and Day” by Al B Sure! “I can tell you how I feel about you night\nand day” With Nite and Day just barely edging out to\nwin. The 1980s blew a high male vocal register\nout of the water. So let’s see how this chart changes when\nwe just focus on falsetto. Things start to shift going back from the\n1980s to the 1970s - the disco era. 1975 was the highest year for falsetto. Where 18% of songs had a value over 4. It also serves as a turning point for the\nBee Gees. This might be surprising to hear, but before\n1975 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was around 0.8. After 1975 it rose to a 5.5. And that makes sense. They had to compete with the likes of Earth,\nWind, and Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield - all artists whose careers\nwere defined by their high voices. I can imagine a record executive in a room\nlistening to a song and they're like “Yeah that's great but you should put some falsetto\nin there somewhere” It wasn’t until 1976 that their now trademark\nfalsetto hit number one. “You should be dancing, yeah” Looking back at both of these charts, it’s\nobvious something shifted after the 1980s. The thing that changed after the 80s is you\nhave hip hop becoming massively popular. And today it's the most popular genre. If you look at the average song there just\nisn't as many opportunities for for a falsetto because there's just less singing. So how do we account for that? So I created this toggle that basically said\nis there singing in this song which is also from the Pandora data, they basically have\na spoken variable. So first let’s see what happens when we\ntoggle the singing function for songs in the top 10. 1996 and 2015 really shoot up. Let’s focus on 1996 first. This was the year Neo-Seoul went mainstream. Artists like D’Angelo and Maxwell led the\ncharge. Their voices were a modern twist on the soul\nartists of the 1970s. I mean just listen to D’Angelo next to Curtis\nMayfield. “When I first saw you baby\nI wanted to die Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine” “So In Love, every time we kiss” 2\n1996 was a huge year for Falsetto, but so was 2015. And here are maybe your your your ears hearing\nthe right thing, relative to other years, 2015 was the year of high voices. Regardless of which toggle we select or which\ncombination of falsetto and register we choose, we did find this: if a song has falsetto,\nwhether it’s a 1 or a 10, it’s going to chart higher — and longer. This is true across nearly every year. Not only that, Top 10 Hits are more likely\nto use falsetto. Take a look at that huge spike in 2015. 66% of songs that peaked in the top 10 had\nfalsetto. Regardless of the decade, high male voices\nare iconic. From the Frankie Vallie belting Sherry “Sherry baby” To the 70s swagger of Bloodstone’s “Natural\nHigh” “I'm trying to make something out of nothing\nAnd I don't even know you” To the Weeknd’s hazy R&B “None of these toys on lease too, ah\nMade your whole year in a week too, yah” It feels like today is very good for the commercial\nviability of the high male voice. And I think that's true if the window of time is the millennials' lifetime. But if you were to talk to your parents or\nyour parents parents they'd be like Oh you think today is good. In nineteen seventy five it's not even comparable. The reason why it might feel like a trend\ntoday is because this is all we've ever known.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Press secretary for March for Our Lives. He\'s a survivor of the Parkland massacre, and he\'s become one of the most recognizable\nfaces in the movement for gun control. He\'s also probably one of the most vilified\npeople in right-wing media right now. It\'s literally been about six weeks, and I\'m already being compared to Hitler. Google Hogg\'s name and you\'ll find sites accusing\nhim of being a crisis actor, an FBI plant, a brainwashed hate-monger, a fascist. I can\'t really even think of the top five because there\'s about 50 million. If I experienced even a fraction of that, I would collapse into a puddle of soy milk. But rather than crumbling under the pressure, Hogg and his friends have flourished, keeping their cause in the national spotlight while repeatedly dunking on their critics. So, David, The guy, is it David Hogg? He started off as this balanced, nice kid. He\'s just now become a real bomb thrower. Someone like this I think isn\'t helping the\nconversation. To David six weeks ago, I would say get some more coffee and get an external charger. You\'re going to need it. It\'s kind of hard to believe, but just a few months ago, David Hogg was a typical nerdy high school\nkid. A debater, his school\'s news director, an amateur video producer. And like any good nerd journalist, Hogg knew a bit about the right-wing fever\nswamp. Before all of this, I did know who Alex Jones\nwas. I did know who Laura Ingraham was. Well, actually, I didn\'t know who Laura was. But I did know who Alex Jones was because of all the insane things that he said to the Sandy Hook survivors. That background ended up coming in handy. After the Parkland shooting, Hogg and his\nfriends became central figures in the debate over\ngun control. And that made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine. Forgive me if I don\'t want a lesson on the Second Amendment from a 16-year-old. You\'re too immature to carry a firearm, you\'re too immature to make policy. What a conceited, arrogant know-it-all. It\'s hard not to just go after this kid. Authoritarianism is always about youth marches. These poor children, they have no soul. Hogg is funded by George Soros, a literal Nazi collaborator. Honestly, I figured a lot more of our attacks would be against our policies, not really\nagainst me. The most notable of these have been the conspiracy theories. On social media, right-wing conspiracy theories going viral about David Hogg. Falsely accused survivor David Hogg of being\na crisis actor. That video was viewed more than 200,000 times before it was taken down. And when I ask Hogg about those, he\'s visibly frustrated. I literally interviewed people in the school during the shooting thinking I was going to\nfucking die. I don\'t know how else to prove to these people that I was there, because I was. This is how the right-wing smear machine works: by bombarding the target with a flood of ridiculous but inflammatory personal attacks. Victims can either ignore the smears and risk becoming defined by them, or they can try to respond, burning a ton of time and energy trying to keep up with each new attack. Either way, the target’s original message\ngets lost. It\'s like a never-ending game of bullshit\nwhack-a-mole. No matter what I show, it\'s always going to\nbe, ""Oh, that\'s false."" Or, ""Oh, that..."" It\'s insane. You can see the toll that trying to keep up with all this stuff has taken on Hogg. But then something happens. Hogg catches himself. And for the rest of the interview, he’s\nway more relaxed. They\'ve gone from saying that I wasn\'t at\nthe school at the time to saying that I\'m a crisis actor to saying that I\'m a 27-year-old that has\na facelift to saying that I\'m actually 135 years old\nand that I\'m a, like, shape-shifting lizard, essentially. I mean, I don\'t know about you guys, but last time I checked, getting a facelift doesn\'t make your acting career any better. So. That moment, that ""breathe,"" is really important. Hogg realizes he\'s getting caught up in the\nbullshit and decides not to take the bait. I\'m a debate kid, and I\'ve always been made\nfun of throughout my life. I\'m used to it, and a lot of us are too, sadly. Yeah, I feel that. If you continue to pursue whatever path they\'re leading you down, which is a dead\nend, it\'s going to end up distracting you and draining your resources, and you don\'t need that. Instead of playing whack-a-mole, the Parkland students have chosen to pick\ntheir battles, engaging their trolls strategically. One of the most notable ways they do this\nis through humor. Some of them called you actors. Well, I am an actor, actually. I’m in Spring Awakening right now. We just joke around a lot, and that\'s how we\'re dealing with a lot of this and kind\nof coping in some weird way. Look at the Twitter feeds of many of the Parkland\nsurvivors and you\'ll find them using humor to respond\nto their critics, turning smears and conspiracy theories into\njokes that get them thousands of retweets. At this point, it\'s just, it\'s so stupid. It is funny for all of us to witness the ridiculousness\nof the situation. Laughing it off is a coping mechanism, for\nsure. But Hogg says it\'s also a good PR move. Laughing it off is great because it keeps\nyou in the news more. Not only do you get a laugh but your followers\nget a laugh, and you get a follow too. Laughing it off also works because it lets students respond to their critics without giving them too much credit. When you\'re laughing, you\'re showing that\nyou don\'t care, and it makes people realize how ridiculous\nthese individuals are, because they\'re only going to be taken seriously if you take them seriously. That approach works well when you\'re dealing with fringe commentators like Alex Jones, people who are already ripe for mockery. I don\'t want to see him kissing goblins. Having political succubus with goblins. Ingratiating goblins. But sometimes the troll isn\'t some fringe\nperson you can laugh at. Sometimes it\'s the host of a major television\ntalk show, like Fox News\'s Laura Ingraham, who in March decided to mock Hogg on Twitter for getting turned down by a few colleges. In cases like that, Hogg responds a little\ndifferently. I was actually sitting at dinner with my sister, and I was thinking about it for a minute. My friends have responded plenty; maybe I\njust should lay off. And then I\'m like, ""Mmm, I\'m too petty for that."" Hogg responded by tweeting a list of Laura\nIngraham\'s advertisers, and before long, he had tens of thousands\nof retweets. What\'s the one thing that\'s common in all\nconflict? Economics. What does Laura care about more than anything? Her $4 million salary. Within 24 hours, major advertisers had yanked their ads from Ingraham\'s show. Ingraham publicly apologized ""in the spirit\nof Holy Week."" And Hogg got another round of earned national media coverage for his cause. What I want to get on from is the negativity\nin this situation, and I want to focus on what\'s ahead for our\nmovement. You don\'t need to go after these people personally because that\'s just immature, and that\'s what they\'re trying to do to you. Go after their advertisers and them making\nmoney. This is a David-and-Goliath story. It appears David has won. Before we ended our interview, I asked Hogg what advice he\'d give to other\nactivists, especially students, who might find themselves in the crosshairs of the right-wing smear machine. Whenever somebody calls you a dick or whatever, just say, “I love you,” honestly. That\'s what this world needs. We don\'t need anybody else being super mean\nto each other like Laura was to me or anybody else. Point out the few that are just absolutely\nridiculous, and after that, people will start fighting\nfor you because you shouldn\'t have to, obviously. Yeah, they shouldn\'t. It is deeply disturbing that teenagers who survived a mass shooting have to worry about how to deal with this stuff. But under the weight of intense media attention\nand pressure, these students are putting on a master class in how to deal with bullies.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether it’s sugar or grease or carbs, pretty\nmuch bring it on! And I spend a lot of time in Montana, so for\nme, that medium rare, grass fed ribeye steak? Pretty much as good as it gets. I know. I don’t do it often and when I do, I gotta\nadmit I feel a little conflicted. And that’s for a lot of reasons, including\nthe planet. But how big of a problem is what I eat? I mean, does it really make much of a dent\nin something as huge as global warming? It turns out, what we put on our plates matters\na lot. About 25 percent of all the global climate\nchange problems we’re seeing can be attributed back to the food and the choices that we’re\nactually making about what we eat on a daily basis. This is greater than all of the cars on the\nplanet. In fact, it’s about twice as much global\nwarming pollution as the cars. Ben Houlton and Maya Almaraz study the connection\nbetween climate and diet at the University of California, Davis. They track how the way we produce food creates\ngreenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. With their data, the team has crunched the\nnumbers to figure out how much carbon pollution is produced by different foods and different\ndiets. A lot of people feel really helpless when\nit comes to climate change, like they can’t make a difference. And what our research is showing is that your\npersonal decisions really can have a big impact. So, take that grass fed ribeye steak I love. If you really look at everything that went\ninto making a single serving of beef, you end up emitting about 330 grams of carbon. That’s like driving a car three miles. Now, if I choose to have chicken instead,\nthere’s more than a five-fold drop in emissions. Switch to fish and you see the number go down\neven more. Now, look at veggies. If I swapped beef out entirely for lentils,\nwell, I’m down to practically nothing! So, why does beef and lamb, too, for that\nmatter - pack such a powerful punch to the planet? Livestock accounts for a little over 14 percent\nof global greenhouse gas emissions. If that sort of seems low to you, consider\nit’s about equal to transportation. We’re talking all the cars, trucks, planes,\ntrains and ships on the planet combined! This is partly because ruminant animals like\ncows and sheep - they’re just gassy! And the methane they produce is at least 25\ntimes more potent than carbon dioxide. Plus it takes lot of land, fertilizer and\nabout a billion tons of grain to feed all that livestock. And you could feed 3.5 billion people with\nthat grain; if we were just directly eating these grains ourselves, it would eliminate\na lot of the CO2 that is emitted from cattle production. So it’s clear that meat has a pretty big\ncarbon load, but it’s also worth remembering that not all livestock is raised equally. In parts of the American West, for instance,\nranchers are working to raise livestock in ways that actually help restore the land. And they’re experimenting with ways that\nsoil and grasslands can be used to keep carbon pollution out of the air. But even these sustainable ranchers will really\ntell you, we’re probably eating too much meat. I know a lot of people who if you don’t\nserve them meat for lunch or dinner, they’re kind of like ""well, when is the meat coming out?"" It\'s to the point now where the U.S. actually\nhas one of the highest meat footprints per capita. So, what about not eating meat at all? Vegan is the way to go for the least impact\non the planet, but it’s not that much different, in terms of emissions, than say, a vegetarian\ndiet. And the team found that the environmental\nimpact of the Mediterranean diet is pretty similar to vegan and vegetarian diets. It’s a lot less meat-heavy than what Americans\nare used to - so, fish and poultry a few times a week; beef maybe once a month, plenty of\nplant-based foods, and of course, loads of olive oil. Eliminating like 90 percent of your meat intake\nis more important than eliminating all of your meat. We don’t all have to be vegan. We don’t all even have to be vegetarian. If we can just reduce our meat intake, every\nlittle bit helps. And if you can bring it down a lot, you can\nhelp the climate a lot. If we all just switched to a Mediterranean\ndiet, it could actually solve 15 percent of global warming pollution by 2050. If everyone were to move towards it, that\nis equivalent to taking somewhere around a billion cars off of the streets, in terms\nof vehicle emissions each year. So, that kind of a footprint is big-time. But say you still want more meat than the\nMediterranean diet recommends? Just cutting down your portion size to the\ndoctor-recommended 4 ounces can reduce your emissions by half. That’s huge! In fact, the doctors are telling us we’re\neating about twice as much meat as we really need for a healthy diet. The good news is, we are listening to our\ndoctors. In the last decade, there’s been a 19 percent\ndrop in the amount of beef we eat. All these things that you\'re already being\ntold are good for you also happen to be good for the planet. So what we eat really is a big part of the\nclimate puzzle. I mean, we may not all be able to afford an\nelectric car or putting solar panels on our house, but we all have to eat every day. And these choices we make can add up to really\nbig numbers. And since meat has a pretty big carbon load,\nwe need to be thoughtful about how much we eat. As for that ribeye steak that I really love,\nI am honestly trying to cut back! Maybe it’s just a smaller piece of steak;\nor simply swapping out a meat dish for a veggie burger. It may seem like a small thing, but it really\ndoes add up to big impacts. Hey, so what did you have for dinner last\nnight?

And immediately we started geeking out over the masked emcee,\nMF Doom. His flow I have to be careful with his flow\nbecause his flow lives in my mind and in my heart. I can almost get into his mind on how\nhe writes. You know? This is what MF Doom sounds like. Just listen. He’ll have entire bars that rhyme. Like\nthe entire set up bar rhymes with every syllable in the punchline bar. It’s incredible. It made me wonder: What can I learn from rappers simply by looking\nat how they rhyme with the beat? I try to start off with 16 dots on the paper. That’s Rakim. He’s widely regarded as\none of the most influential MCs of all time. If 4 bars was this long. I see like a graph\nbetween them four bars. I could place so many words and so many syllables. I could take\nit to the point where there were no other words you could put in those 4 bars. So, before we get into rhymes we need to know\nwhat beats and bars are. Martin: I always try to find the beat of the\nmusic first. That’s Martin Connor. He’s analyzed the\nmost rhythmically dense rap songs down to the last syllable. And he writes about it. Martin: A bar is a grouping together of 4\nbeats. Before guys like Rakim came along, rhymes\nin rap songs were pretty basic. Take one of the first commercially successful\nrap songs from 1980, “The Breaks” by Kurtis Blow This simple AA BB rhyming pattern with no\nword play or puns is pretty predictable, lyrically and musically But, fast forward to 1986 and you’ve got\nsongs like “Eric B. Is President” from Eric B. & Rakim. Compare this to “The Breaks” and it’s\nclear the frequency of rhymes is greater. But not only are you seeing more rhymes you’re\nalso starting to see different kinds of rhymes. “Indeed” and “Proceed” are internal\nrhymes because they happen inside the sentence. “Man made a mix” and “band-aid to fix”\nare multisyllable rhymes The other thing Rakim does later in the verse\nis cross the bar line and he does it in a tremendously clever way. Crossing the bar line happens when a sentence\nlike “The rhyme can’t be kept inside” doesn’t end when the bar ends. If you listen closely you’ll hear that the\nsecond syllable of inSIDE Lands on the first beat of the next bar. Rakim even references this in the lyric. And\nit’s pretty clever. Now, fast forward 11 years and Notorious B.I.G\'s\n“Hypnotize"" cleverly used Rakim’s techniques to make one of the smoothest rap songs ever. Martin: What I like most about this is that\nit’s not predictable and it’s always changing. So sometimes Notorious B.I.G.s sentences are\nlong. Sometimes they’re short. Like the moment in this verse here: He’s also completely comfortable delivering\na sentence across the barline. But, what makes this song stand out the most to me\nis that before one rhyme scheme ends, another one begins. Like this moment in verse 2. The first group of rhymes is the “oo”\nrhymes and it links the first and second sentence which then begins the “ih” and so on. It’s a huge reason Biggie sounds so smooth\nhere. Now, as much as Biggie daisy chained an entire\nsong together with rhymes, he was, for the most part using single syllable and single\nword rhymes. And this is where artists like Mos Def push\nthings even further. His verse on “Re:Definition” from 2002\nhits nearly every note within the bar with 4 syllable rhymes. And he does it across a whopping 14 bars. In Re:Definition, Mos Def is very clearly\nrhyming each word with the beat. This is where Andre 3000 shakes things up\nwith his verse in Aquemini. Focus on the beat first. Now listen to each syllable, with the beat in mind. Most rappers would have dollars, parlors,\nand bottles all rhyme similarly on the beat. But Andre is accenting each rhyme within different\nplaces relative to the beat and bar. People say that the word orange doesn\'t rhyme with anything. \nAnd that kinda pisses me off because I can think of a lot of things that rhyme with orange... In fact, Eminem, does this exact thing on\nhis 2002 song “Business” Eminem doesn’t just pack in tremendously\ndense multi syllable rhymes, he also tells incredibly vivid stories. And for a lot of people that wins in a battle. This is where “Lose Yourself” comes in.\nIt was the first rap song to win an Academy Award. Whew the Oscar goes to Eminem, for Lose Yourself\nfrom 8 Mile. Martin: I’ll see the line and I’ll separate it all into not just words or sentences, but into their syllables. When you group all of these rhymes together,\nthis incredibly complex rhyme scheme emerges. It’s unpredictable, it’s complex rhythmically\nand lyrically but - It’s not just that you’re rhyming, \nIt’s that while you’re rhyming you’re still telling a good story. And ""Lose Yourself"" is like that. Today, rappers like Kendrick Lamar are carrying on the tradition of artists \nthat are able to use the musicality of rhymes to create really memorable songs. Let’s look at Kendrick Lamar’s “Rigamortus” The first thing you’ll notice is that Kendrick\nhas created a very clear motive with his rhymes. What’s a motive? It’s a short musical\nidea. A musical fragment or succession of notes that has some special importance in\na composition. Here’s probably the most recognizable motive\nin the history of music. That “du du du dummmmm” is carried out\nthrough the entire piece. It’s 3 quick notes followed by a long note. The musical motive in “Rigamortus” is\ntwo short notes followed by a long note, stringing the entire\nsong together. When Kendrick goes into 4th gear he\nkeeps the motive going. And the motive keeps him in check. As much as Biggie’s “Hypnotize” sounds\ncompletely different from “Rigamortus” there are a lot of musical similarities. Remember how Biggie daisy chained rhymes?\nKendrick does that too here. In “Hypnotize” Biggie also creates a motive with the sequence\nof rhymes here: Now, let’s get back to MF Doom. Two years\nafter “Lose Yourself” won an Academy Award, MF Doom released 3 full albums including Madvillainy - which is widely considered one\nof the best underground hip hop records period. Mos Def can’t even contain his excitement\ntalking about Doom. For the most part, MF Doom rhymes on the beat\nbut he uses multi syllable rhyming phrases up with wazoo often rhyming entire lines together. This is called a holorime. Mike: He’ll do setup punchline. Like his\nfollowing bar will be referencing the punchline but not in a way that he’ll be setting up\na another one, he just starts to go in another direction, but just acknowledges where the last bar was. This is what Mike is talking about. MF Doom understands the power of rhyme and\nthe beat and completely manipulates it in a humorous way. As Pitchfork points out “the rhyme\'s pattern\nand rap\'s topical stereotype demands the word ""bitches,"" yet Doom hilariously says ""booze""\nand uses that rhyme to connect the next sentence. Where artists like Kendrick Lamar, Eminem,\nand Andre 3000 are telling very vivid stories with their rhymes, MF Doom is using his dense\nrhymes like a villain would use his superpower. Before you know it you’re being hit with\na killer punchline, double entendres, and clever wordplay. Martin: I love rappers with that  syncopated uneven phrasing where the sentences don\'t line up with the bars because, like you said, you can\'t predict what\'s going to happen. The point of appreciating it is to see what the very most clever human beings are capable of doing that you didn\'t think possible.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,0,Aretha Franklin’s musical genius in 2 songs,"Two songs that show off Aretha Franklin’s gospel roots.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOAretha Franklin will always be the Queen of Soul. In the 1960s songs like “Respect” became the symbol for political and social change. It’s likely the reason her music moved so many people wasn’t necessarily the lyrics, but the way she delivered them. Aretha was raised in the church, and her life and music was rooted in gospel music. You can hear this so clearly in her live performances and covers, where every musical decision she made was in the moment. Listen to any one of Aretha’s songs and you’ll understand the power of gospel music, but her live performance of “Dr. Feelgood” and her cover of “Son of a preacher man” are a great place to start. Special thanks to Brigitta Johnson, Robert Darden, and Raymond Wise for sharing their expertise in gospel music history. Note: The title of this video has been updated. It was previously """"The gospel according to Aretha Franklin."""" Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Because, very simply, she doesn\'t sing soul — she is soul. Soul is rooted in gospel, a genre of music\nthat combines rhythm and blues with church hymns. Aretha was exposed to those sounds her entire\nchildhood. She was raised in the church where her father,\nCL Franklin, was the most well known preacher in the US during the golden age of gospel\nin the 1940s and 50s. You could hear any one of Aretha’s hits\nand witness a master class in the power of gospel music, but it’s her covers and her\nlive performances that really reveal all the gospel techniques she had at her disposal. Aretha could turn any song into a gospel song. Just take a look at these two tracks. The top is British soul singer, Dusty Springfield’s,\nmost iconic song “Son of a Preacher Man” Dusty and Aretha shared the same producer,\nJerry Wexler at Atlantic Records. The song first went to Aretha, who ended up\npassing on it. Dusty took it, and in early 1969 her version\nrose to the top of the charts. A year later, Aretha released a cover of it\nand it sounded completely different. Where Dusty started with a smooth electric\nguitar riff, Aretha started on the piano. An instrument\nthat, along with the hammond organ, played a central role \nin the sound of gospel music and her career. The fingers and the voice are all part of that same tradition. And she was trained by the best. Aretha comes up during the golden era of gospel music and actually her piano teacher is the late Reverand James Cleveland, who became king of gospel. Here he is, backing her on the piano. Aretha sat behind a piano her whole career\n-- at any point she could speed up or slow down, creating a spectrum of emotional moments. Like this moment here: There\'s an old saying in the black church: This valley is there to build to that final\nclimactic moment of the song. In gospel music it’s often called the “special\nchorus” or vamp. The vamp is almost like\nyou take the essence of the song. the most memorable rhythmic piece is repeated\nover and over. Clara Ward and the Ward Singers, Aretha Franklin’s\nbiggest mentors, perfected this in their gospel recording of “Packing Up” This key component of gospel was everywhere\nin the music of the 1960s. Listen to the Rolling Stones imitate those high notes of\nMarion Williams in “Sympathy for the Devil.” Aretha carried that gospel tradition of repetition\nand vocal improvisation over into her music too. In this recording she improvises over her backup vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations. I think in the case of the preacher man they were even\nsaying literally Hallelujah. You know, right on the top of the groove. The same singers were on Dusty\'s version too. But their voicing on Aretha\'s recording is completely different. One of the most exciting differences is when they echo “Sock it to me” a phrase they also sing\nin “Respect”. They added ""sock it to me"" into that, it became like a thing. [Repeating ""Sock it to me""] Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to yourself. Sock it to me? Sock it to me. Lay it on me. Give me a high five. Know what I\'m sayin\'? Was that innocent, or.. coincidental? Now what did you think it meant? Well, you\'d come home and give me my propers. Son of a Preacher Man lives on vinyl as a\nstudio recording, but Aretha’s gospel roots really shine when she’s playing live. Take her performance of “Dr. Feelgood,""\nlive at Fillmore West in San Francisco. In a 1971 review, Ebony magazine\nsaid “The album captures the spirit of her in-person performances that are never merely\nshows but more rituals of an almost religious nature."" This music has to be inspired of the moment. There’s always a single moment in every\nsingle one of her live performances where the crowd erupts. In Dr. Feelgood it happens about 2 minutes\nin - almost the ending of the song. [ Aretha Frankling performing live at the Fillmore West in San Francisco] [Cheers and shouting erupting from the audience.] [Aretha Franklin continues singing."" She can literally control the crowd when she\'s\nat that moment in the song. This is a blues song, but at this moment she’s\npriming people for a spiritual awakening. At the very end, where she just starts to kind of talk to the crowd, and she said you want to sit\ndown and cross your arms and crossed her legs and look up to heaven. So she\'s now talking about ecstasy but she\'s\nsinging about it in a way that\'s very spiritual and sacred. You know, she’s using gospel to\nget us there. [Aretha Franklin interacting with the crowd at the Fillmore West.] She inhabits these songs to a degree that we\'re not used to seeing much anymore, that naked vulnerability. It\'s coming from a church tradition. You may only have an audience of 10, but you may have been put\nthere to reach one person. It was very rare that a gospel singer could\ngo back and forth between gospel and pop so freely, but Aretha’s voice and authenticity\ntranscended genres. So this is 1971 and if anyone in gospel as a performer\nwould have done that, it would have been controversial. Somehow Aretha was able to bounce back and forth and stay, to the end, true to both worlds.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,0,Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann’s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

It shows the ideology of both parties in Congress over the past few decades. Researchers looked at every politician\'s voting\nrecord and then gave them a score based on how extreme or moderate they were. And if you look at the past 40 years, something dramatic has happened. Both parties have moved away from the center, but Republicans in Congress have moved much further than Democrats have. That difference is even more jarring if you look at the past few presidents. Republican presidents have become more and more conservative over the past few\ndecades while Democrats have stayed fairly consistent. Political scientists have a name for this. They call it asymmetrical polarization. It\'s one of the most important trends in recent\nAmerican politics. But it\'s also one of the hardest to talk about. And that\'s posing a big challenge for journalists who want to stay neutral while covering a\nparty that\'s increasingly going off the rails. This is not the Republican Party that any\nof us recognize. This is not the Republican Party I joined\n40 years ago. What happened to the Republican Party? I\'ve been asking myself that question. It\'s soul crushing for me. Let\'s just address the soy boy in the room. I am not a great person to be making this\nargument. I\'m a queer, tree-hugging atheist with immigrant\nparents. Me criticizing Republicans is about as shocking as Vox having marimbas in the background of\na video. So I brought some backup. I\'m Norm Ornstein. I\'m a political scientist. I\'ve been think-tanking it for longer than most of the people watching this have been\nalive. Norm Ornstein is kind of a legend. He\'s spent the past four decades writing about Congress and American politics. He\'s been named one of the Top 100 Global\nThinkers. I used to win debate competitions in high\nschool using articles that Ornstein wrote. A fun fact that he did not find to be that\nfun. Most of Ornstein\'s work has focused on how to make sure that Congress stays functional. I worked very closely with a lot of Democrats and with a lot of Republicans. In all the years that I wrote about Congress, I was very, very careful to be not a partisan. But if you look at the titles of Ornstein\'s\nbooks, you can see a quiet transformation happening. It starts off normal enough. Congress and Change: Evolution and Reform Campaign Finance: An Illustrated Guide Then it gets a little darker. The Permanent Campaign and Its Future The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing\nAmerica And then, in 2012, Ornstein and his writing\npartner Thomas Mann write this book: It\'s Even Worse Than It Looks: How The American Constitutional System Collided With The New Politics of Extremism. In it, they write: ""The Republican Party is\nan insurgent outlier. It has become ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise, and dismissive of\nthe legitimacy of its political opposition. The Democratic Party, while no paragon of\nvirtue, is more open to incremental changes fashioned through bargaining with the Republicans. This asymmetry constitutes a huge obstacle to effective governance."" Holy sh-. Tom Mann and I came to the conclusion that we couldn\'t sugarcoat this anymore. The fact is that Congress changed. Ornstein\'s critique of the modern GOP falls into two major categories: their goals and their methods. There\'s no question that the Republican Party\'s\ngoals have become more extreme over the past few\nyears. In 2006, George Bush was talking about immigration\nlike this: There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship and a program of mass deportation. Compare that to Donald Trump: You\'re going to have a deportation force. In 1970, a Republican president created the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate\npollution. These problems will not stand still for politics or for partisanship. Now, Republicans campaign on abolishing that\nsame agency. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into\nyour lives. Even the Republican obsession with tax cuts is a relatively new phenomenon. Reagan is worshipped as a tax hawk now, but he actually raised taxes 11 times during\nhis presidency. Do you think the millionaire ought to pay\nmore in taxes than the bus driver or less? More! Ronald Reagan, welcome to the resistance? On its own, that ideological shift isn\'t a\nhuge problem as long as the two parties still work together. Our political parties are supposed to view\nthe other side as adversaries who may view the world differently, but we can work with them. And that\'s where Ornstein\'s second critique\ncomes in. About Republicans methods. The way they pursue their policy goals. Over the past few decades, Republicans have\ngotten less and less willing to work with Democrats\non anything. This chart shows how often the filibuster\nwas used to block a vote in the Senate. When Republicans aren\'t in power, they\'re more willing to stop Democrats from getting anything done. And you can really see it escalate after Obama wins the presidency in ’08. That year, Democrats won both houses of Congress. And in a normal world, Republicans would have taken the L, reworked their campaign strategy, and focused on the next election. Instead, Mitch McConnell came out and said\nthis: Our top political priority over the next two\nyears should be to deny President Obama a second\nterm. Cool beans. And it wasn\'t just McConnell. In a private meeting before Obama\'s inauguration, leading Republicans reportedly agreed, ""If you act like you\'re the minority, you\'re going to stay in the minority. We\'ve got to challenge them on every single\nbill and challenge them on every single campaign."" And they did. In 2011, Republicans held the debt ceiling\nhostage, threatening to let the country default if the Democratic majority didn\'t agree to major cuts in Medicare and Social Security. As long as this president is in the Oval Office, a real solution is probably unattainable. In 2013, they actually shut the government\ndown trying to force Obama to defund Obamacare. That was a remarkable victory to see the House engage in a profile in courage. A lot of this obstruction wasn\'t even ideological. Some of it was ""no"" for the sake of ""no."" In 2016, Republicans rejected Obama\'s budget before they even saw what was in it. And then, of course, there\'s Merrick Garland. Republicans flat out refused to meet with Obama\'s Supreme Court nominee for months. Not because he was too liberal. Garland was objectively a centrist. But because they wanted a Republican to fill\nthe seat. We don\'t intend to take up a nominee. You ever watch someone\'s soul wither away\nmid-sentence? The thing is, if Hillary had won the election, many Republicans said they would have kept the seat open permanently, preferring to have an incomplete Supreme Court than let a Democrat appoint a justice. That is not normal behavior by party leaders. And it is a reflection of a strategy designed to divide Americans and use your leverage to hold power even if you are not a majority\nin the country. Regardless of how you feel about tax cuts\nor Obamacare, this my-way-or-the-highway approach is bad\nfor democracy. And Ornstein\'s book was his attempt to get\nneutral observers, including journalists, to admit that. And it really is a party that I would say\nhas gone rogue. And I don\'t say that as a partisan. It is a fact of life. An unfortunate one for the country. The problem is admitting that fact makes you sound like a liberal hack. And if you look at the comments on this video, you know exactly what I mean. Talking about asymmetric polarization, by definition, means you treat the two parties differently. And that means being accused of liberal bias. This is tough for media to do. Tough because you get caught in the crosshairs. It\'s tough because you can lose viewers or\nlisteners. So instead, many networks have framed political\nfights as just bitter disputes between two parties\nthat can\'t get along. A stalemate now exists as both sides dig in\ntheir heels. Both sides blaming one another for this impasse. Both sides playing politics. You saw it during the 2013 government shutdown. Republicans literally held the government\nhostage to undermine Obamacare. But instead of pointing that out, a lot of coverage blamed both sides for not\ncompromising. With both sides digging in, we are now in\nuncharted territory. Both sides refuse to budge. Washington is a dysfunctional town and there\'s plenty of blame to go around on\nboth sides. Obama went out of his way to avoid that framing. I want every American to understand why it\ndid happen. They demanded ransom just for doing their\njob. But the media\'s affinity for that ""both sides""\nframe meant that even those comments got criticized. President Obama playing the blame game. Playing the blame game. The blame game continues. This kind of knee-jerk neutrality makes it really hard to understand who\'s responsible for breaking our politics. If you are monomaniacal in pursuit of both\nsides, you ignore a reality where there may be one\nside. And the scary thing about asymmetrical polarization is that it forces the other party to play\nhardball too. When Republicans refused to vote on a huge number of Obama\'s judicial appointees, Democrats changed the rules. Democrats voted to lower the threshold to\nbreak a filibuster from 60 votes to 51 votes. It\'s time to change the Senate before this\ninstitution becomes obsolete. It was a bad but necessary response to an\nunusual situation. One created by Republicans. But that decision to change the rules has haunted Democrats for years. As tensions flared over Brett Kavanaugh\'s nomination to the Supreme Court, MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt blamed Democrats for\nstarting the problem. You know there\'s a lot of people you can blame\nfor that. Started with the Democrats and Harry Reid when he took away the filibuster for those\ncircuit court judges and it got lower when Mitch McConnell did\nit for the Supreme Court. Ornstein actually got into a Twitter fight\nwith Hunt over that comment, writing, I know the desire to show you are balanced. But the truth is not always balance. And equating Reid — who is no angel — with McConnell, who blew up more norms and\npractices in the Senate than all other leaders before\nhim combined, is just wrong. Damn Norm. This problem is likely to get worse as time\ngoes on. The more Republicans move to the extreme, the more Democrats are going to seem obstructionist\nin response. Look at this filibuster graph again. Every time Republicans raise the stakes, Democrats react by matching them. That\'s going to make it really tempting to\nsay, “Both sides are equally bad.” Guess what the Democrats are doing. Punching back, tit for tat. Neither side here has clean hands. There seem to be no grownups in charge. And what that does is it means that people who behave badly get off the hook. Nobody blames them for it. And it\'s easy for them to say, ""Hey, the other side is worse."" The only way to discourage this kind of norm-breaking\nbehavior is to be really clear about who\'s causing\nit. And that\'s going to require journalists to\nbe brutally honest about what\'s happening to the Republican Party. It doesn\'t mean that you all become tribal\nadvocates. It means that you call out people who are\nviolating norms or who are behaving in a corrupt fashion. But if you don\'t do that, then you\'re not\ndoing what you\'re supposed to do as a vital part\nof a free society. Some of the worst things have been said about me over the years have been said by\nNorm Ornstein. One thing we agree on. Some of the worst things that have been said\nabout me have been said by you.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, here’s some bad news.\nI read more than sixty studies on this, and it turns out exercise is actually pretty useless\nwhen it comes to weight loss. Dr. Kevin Hall at the National Institutes of Health has done some of the most important studies on exercise and weight loss\nWe need to rebrand exercise … exercise isn’t a weight loss tool per se, it's excellent\nfor health is probably the best single thing that you can do other than stopping smoking\nto improve your health. But don’t look at it as a weight loss tool.\nExercise will definitely help you live a longer, happier life…. It’s just not the best\nway to lose weight. And the reason has to do with how our bodies use energy.\nYou may not realize it, but physical activity is actually a tiny component of your daily\nenergy burn. There are three main ways our bodies burn\ncalories. These include your resting metabolism, so\nthat's how much energy your body burns just for its basic functioning, just to keep you\nalive, basically. The other part of energy expenditure is the\nthermic effect of food, and that’s just how much energy is required to break food\ndown in your body. The third part of energy expenditure is physical\nactivity. For most people, physical activity - that’s\nany movement you do, only accounts for about 10 to 30 percent of energy use.\nSo the vast majority of energy or calories you burn every day comes from your basal or\nresting metabolism, over which you have very little control.\nWhile 100% of your “calories in” are up to you, only up to about 30% of your “calories\nout” are in your control. One study found that if a 200-pound man ran\nfor an hour, 4 days a week for a month, he’d lose about 5 pounds at most, assuming everything\nelse stays the same. And everything else doesn’t stay the same!\nResearchers have found we make all kinds of behavioral and physiological adaptations when\nwe start increasing the amount of exercise we’re getting every day.\nFor one thing, exercise tends to make people hungry.\nAnd I'm sure you know the feeling: you go for a spinning class in the morning, and\nthen by the time you eat breakfast you're so hungry you maybe double the size of the\nportion of oatmeal you normally eat. There's also evidence to suggest that some\npeople simply slow down after a work out, so if you went running in the morning you\nmight be less inclined to take the stairs at work.\nThese are called “compensatory behaviors” -- the various ways we unknowingly undermine\nour workouts. Researchers have also discovered a phenomenon\ncalled metabolic compensation. As people start to slim down, their resting metabolism can slow down. So the amount of energy you burn while at rest is lower. That means this bar might shrink as you start to lose weight. There’s still a lot of research to be done,\nbut one study from 2012 is particularly interesting. They went out into the middle of the Savannah\nin Tanzania to measure the energy burn among a group of hunter gathers called the Hadza.\nThese are super-active, lean hunter-gatherers. They’re not spending their days behind a computer at a desk. And what they found was shocking. What we found is that there was no difference at all. So even though the Hadza have a much more physically active lifestyle, they weren't burning any more calories every day than adults in the US and Europe.\nSomehow the energy they used for physical activity was being offset or conserved elsewhere.\nSo how do they stay slim? They don’t overeat. We can undo the calories that we burn off in exercise pretty quickly. It would take about an hour of running to burn off a Big Mac and fries. You’d have to spend about an hour dancing\npretty vigorously to burn off three glasses of wine you might drink with dinner.\nAn hour of cycling really intensely on exercise bikes to burn off about two doughnuts.\nThat’s why exercise is best seen as a healthy supplement for a strategy that’s focused\non food. But despite extremely high obesity rates in\nthe US, government agencies continue to present exercise as a solution\n... as do companies with a real interest in making sure we keep eating and drinking their\nproducts. Since the 1920s, companies like Coca-Cola\nhave been aligning themselves with the exercise message.\nThe idea here is that you can drink all these extra bottles of soda as long as you work\nout. But as we're seeing, it doesn't work like that. Actually burning off those extra calories from a can of soda is really, really hard. We have an obesity problem in this country, and we shouldn't treat low physical activity  and eating too many calories as equally responsible for it. Public health policymakers should really prioritize improving our food environment to help people make healthier choices about what they eat. It's not impossible to lose weight through exercise, it's just a lot harder. And we need to recognize how that works. If you do go to the gym, and you burn all these calories, it takes you a long time to do so and you put in a great amount of effort, you can erase all of that in five minutes of eating a slice of pizza. Relative magnitude is actually quite surprising, and most people don't fully appreciate that.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s a little more than one square mile in size and it\'s home to a Chinese military base. There\'s a 10,000 foot airstrip, an advanced radar station, a missile defense system, and about 200 troops. But the strangest thing about Fiery Cross Island is that two years ago, it didn\'t exist. And neither did the six other Chinese military bases that have been built on man-made islands in the South China Sea. If you look at this satellite image from 2014, you can see huge Chinese ships collecting around remote reefs in the Spratly Islands. An archipelago in the South China Sea. In this image, these ships are rapidly pumping sand and rock up onto the reef. They\'re building islands. And less than a year later, the Chinese had seaports air bases and buildings on their new islands and the world had taken notice. We continue our look this morning on what China does not want you to see the superpower is reclaiming land in seven spots in the South China Sea adding on average more than three-and-a-half acres everyday. With these islands times trying to lay claim to one of the most important areas of ocean in the world the South China Sea. The South China Sea is incredibly rich in natural resources 11 billion barrels of oil, 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and ten percent of the world\'s fisheries. Most importantly though, 30% of the world\'s shipping trade flows through here to the booming population centers and economic markets of Southeast Asia. It\'s an extremely important body of water and right now five countries lay claim to some part of it. Now, most countries base their claim off the UN Law of the Seas, which says a country\'s territorial waters extend 200 miles off their shore. An area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Countries have exclusive rights to all the resources and trade in there EEZ. It\'s their sovereign territory. So for example, any oil that\'s found within 200 miles off the coast of Vietnam belongs exclusively to Vietnam. But any area that isn\'t in an EEZ is regarded as international waters and it falls under UN maritime law which means everybody shares it. Now, every country in the South China Sea region uses this 200-mile EEZ threshold to determine its claims. All except China. China argued they have a historical claim to the South China Sea dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. And they mark it using a really confusing border called the nine-dash line. Following World War II, Japan who had dominated the entire region, lost all control of its surrounding seas. China used the moment to claim the South China Sea by drawing this imprecise line on the map that encompassed ninety percent of the South China Sea. It became known as the nine-dash line. When the UN established the 200-mile EEZ in 1973 China stuck to its own line, refusing to clarify its boundaries and ignoring claims by other countries. Now that brings us to the Spratly Islands. It\'s a remote barely inhabited cluster of islands currently claimed by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The Spratlys are both geographically and symbolically at the heart of South China Sea. That\'s because any country that can claim the Spratly islands can extend their EEZs to include them and gain exclusive rights to the surrounding territory. But it\'s really hard to legitimately claim uninhabited piles of sand so a few nations have built small buildings and ports on their claimed islands and even stuck a few people there. But China believes all the Spratly Islands belong to them which brings us back to why they\'re building islands there. Installing military bases on these new artificial islands took the dispute to a whole new level showing how China\'s potentially willing to defend its claims with force. Now this is about when the United States took notice. While the US has no claim in the South China Sea, it is the world\'s lone superpower and uses its massive Navy to defend international waters. China sees the US presence in the area as an encroachment in their backyard. When a US destroyer ship sailed just 12 miles off the shore of one of China\'s man-made islands and the Spratlys China sent out their own destroyer and a patrol boat as a warning. China is building these islands in order to increase control around the surrounding waters. Using a strategy that they\'ve deemed ""The Cabbage Strategy"". Where they surround a contested island with as many ships as possible. In May of 2013 China sent several ships to Ayungin shoal, which is just 105 nautical miles off the coast of the Philippines, well within that 200 mile EEZ. The Philippines has eight soldiers stationed there. Like wrapping leaves around a cabbage the Chinese sealed off the Philippines access to Ayungin Shoal with fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers creating blockade so that the Filipinos can\'t receive shipments of food and supplies. By building their own man-made Islands China\'s essentially building naval bases. The more Islands they have the more ships they can support and more territory they can slowly take control of. And the Chinese cautiously use the cabbage strategy in the Spratly islands, taking over contested territory but in small steps avoiding the possibility of igniting a bigger conflict. But the disputes are intensifying. Countries are now actively arresting trespassers in waters that they claim and China could go a step further. Since 2015 they\'ve threatened to declare an air identification zone above the South China Sea, declaring that all aircraft that fly through it would need Chinese permission. Now, publicly China insists that their intentions are not militaristic but their actions say otherwise and it\'s heightening tensions in the region Steve Bannon who sits on the US National Security Council and who is one of President Trump\'s closest advisors is almost certain that the US will go to war in the South China Sea. ""We\'re going to war in the South China Sea, I was a sailor there, a naval officer, we\'re going to war the South China Sea in five to ten years aren\'t we?"" ""there\'s no doubt about it"" But for now the disputes remain only in the legal and diplomatic realms that only occasionally break into minor clashes. In July 2016 the international court at the Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines who charged China with invading their rightful territory in the South China Sea. China dismissed the ruling and enforcement of the law doesn\'t seem likely. Even from the US who released a vague statement urging the two countries to ""clarify their claims"" and ""work together to resolve their disputes"" which is another way of saying ""we don\'t really want to deal with this"". In fact, as the conflict escalates and international courts get involved, the US is stuck in a tricky position. On one hand, they do not want to risk provoking a conflict with China. But on the other they want China to stop bullying their allies in the region. Up until now the US has managed the situation by continuing to patrol through the South China Sea. It\'s also likely that the US would fly fighter jets above the sea if China actually does declare an air identification zone. These are symbolic but effective ways of keeping Chine in check while not getting too involved in the details of the conflict. So far the disputes in the South China Sea have not become violent but countries are starting to defend their claims by increasing troop numbers, weaponizing their territory and provoking each other. It\'s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention for better or for worse.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I\'ll never have to worry about Fox News\never ag- Two of the headlines on Fox News tonight. Gotten a lot of attention thanks to Fox News. Started on Fox News. Yesterday on Fox News. Last night on O\'Reilly. Last night on Hannity. This morning on Fox & Friends. Fox was all over this story. Want to play this clip from Fox. Clip from Fox. Clip from Fox News earlier. It makes my head explode when I see these\nclips from Fox News. Oh, god. It\'s everywhere. There\'s no escape. Thank god for Fox News. Thank god for Fox News. Thank god for Fox. You get the truth out. Thank god for Fox News, or otherwise, no one would be talking about these issues. In an ideal world, political journalism looks\nlike this. On either side, you\'ve got the parties fighting for the attention of the press. And in the middle, you\'ve got journalists sorting through what\'s important and what\'s just partisan bullshit. This is called gatekeeping, and it\'s one of the most important things\njournalists do. Political operatives can spin whatever talking points they want, but ultimately it\'s the journalists who decide what\'s newsworthy enough to pay attention\nto. But that is in an ideal world, and we don\'t live in an ideal world. We live in hell. And in hell, there\'s Fox News. Fox exists in this weird in-between space because it claims to be a news organization but it\'s essentially a Republican front group. The network was founded by GOP political operative\nRoger Ailes. Not sure why he\'s posing like Shirley Temple\nin this picture. Ailes spent his career advising Republican presidents like Reagan, Bush Sr., and surprise, surprise, Nixon. A memo from the Nixon Library detailed Ailes\' dream of launching a Republican news\nnetwork. A plan for putting the GOP on TV news. Which was described as a way to get around the ""prejudices of network news selectors."" Wow, nightmares really do come true. Ailes eventually founded Fox News. And with it, he turned partisan hackery into\nan art form. Obama salutes while holding coffee? Everyone\'s talking about the disrespectful\nway the president saluted a Marine yesterday. Clinton coughs during a campaign event? We all have our coughing spells, but it doesn\'t look good when you have all these conspiracy theories about her health. Rashida Tlaib says a naughty word about Trump? We\'re going to go in there, we\'re going to\nimpeach the motherfucker. Is this what the Democratic Party has become? Buckle up, folks. This is the new Democratic Party. This is the Democratic Party in 2019. Fox knows this fucking bullshit doesn\'t actually\nmatter. But that\'s not the point. The point is pretending that it matters, so voters at home think it does too. Now, I know what you\'re thinking. Oh, my god. Who cares. It\'s Fox. None of us actually watch that crap. Except you do watch that crap, Mary. You just don\'t realize it. Mary? Because once Fox News goes all-in on a story, other networks pay attention. ""What\'s in conservative media? What are conservatives talking about? Take Benghazi, for example. You\'re still mad about this? I\'m still mad about this. In 2012, Fox began peddling wild conspiracy theories about a terror attack in Benghazi. Explosive new details about a possible White House cover-up on Benghazi. Unanswered questions about Benghazi. Questions still remain unanswered. Some have suggested this is bigger than Watergate. Fox\'s goal was to smear the Obama administration,\nsure. But it was also to get other news outlets to take that smear seriously. I think most journalists would be inclined Why is the media not dealing with a clear\ncover-up here? And you say to yourself, And eventually, Mary, it worked. Aren\'t there still legitimate questions to be answered on Benghazi? Very serious unanswered questions. Legitimate questions. Too many questions. It\'s not just for Fox News anymore, it\'s all\nof cable news. So the result of that is that They all go talk about something, Thank god for Fox News for being tenacious\nenough to cause the mainstream media not to ignore\nthis. There is no equivalent to this on the left. And that creates what Matt calls a ""hack gap."" Because conservatives can manufacture their own outrage cycles, mainstream outlets pay a lot more attention to their bullshit. Which means even minor slip-ups by Democrats\ncan become career-defining scandals. In March, Democrat Ilhan Omar gave a speech about how Muslim organizations had to fight\nIslamophobia after 9/11. Pretty non-controversial, right? Wrong again, Mary. Because in April, Republican Dan Crenshaw accused Omar of trivializing 9/11 because she didn\'t say the word terrorist,\nI guess? I don\'t know. Am I bleeding again? And the next morning, Fox News knew what it\nhad to do. Really? Few people did something? You have to wonder if she\'s an American first. Downplaying one of the darkest days in our nation\'s history. The Democratic Party has a problem. Ilhan Omar is embroiled in another controversy\ntoday. After making controversial comments. Do you feel she should apologize? Do you think she should have rethought her\nwords? How do you think this controversy is playing\nout among Democrats? The congresswoman needs to be careful about\nher own words too. This is the kind of hacky nonsense that good\ngatekeeping is supposed to protect us from. And it almost did. Nobody even cared about Omar’s speech for\nweeks after she gave it. But once Fox made it a story, it was over. Look at how many mainstream news segments included clips from Fox. How do you think this controversy is playing out among Democrats? The hack gap is a nightmare in a normal year, but it\'s especially bad during election season. In 2016, a lot of journalists realized that the Clinton email server was not the national crisis Fox was making it out\nto be. Could this new development put her behind\nbars? You\'ve got destruction of evidence. You\'ve got obstruction of justice. There\'s three specific laws that we found. There\'s at least seven that I\'ve found. Lock her up! Yes, lock her up. Ah, that pleases me. But because Fox viewers became fixated on Hillary\'s emails, Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! the story became newsworthy. I remember talking to somebody who was a high-ranking official in a major newspaper and I was asking him, And he said, ""Well, you know, Benghazi, her private email server. It\'s all part of the same narrative and why many voters don\'t trust her. Okay, fair enough. They came from Fox News; they came from conservative . talk radio. The American public know they can\'t trust\nher. Can\'t trust her. We can\'t trust her. So you put this stuff out. this email server. Years later, when it turns out that the Trump\nWhite House is also using unsecured communication lines, it doesn\'t spark the same months-long crisis that Hillary\'s emails did, because there\'s no left-wing propaganda machine baiting journalists into overreacting. It\'s not that there\'s nothing to these stories. Clinton\'s email server was a mistake. Benghazi was a mess. Omar could have said the word terrorists more,\nI guess? Oh, god, it\'s in my ear now. It\'s that they get blown way out of proportion by a propaganda machine that\'s trying to score\npolitical points. And by mainstream journalists who are too afraid of looking biased against conservatives to call bullshit. And the weird genius of the hack gap is that if you\'re not watching Fox News, you won\'t\neven notice it. Because it doesn\'t look like Fox & Friends\nor Hannity. It looks like serious journalists covering\na serious controversy that they\'ve decided is important. But they aren\'t deciding. They\'re reacting to a political operation that was created to get you to pay attention. You can try to ignore Fox News all you want. But as long as journalists are getting their\nstory assignments from conservative media, you can\'t escape\nit. Thanks for watching.

154,0,Giving birth costs a lot. Hospitals won't tell you how much.,"I tried to find out how much my son’s birth would cost before it happened. I failed.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOChildbirth is a really common procedure in the US. Around 4 million women will go to a hospital this year. And most births are relatively uncomplicated. But even for the most common medical procedure in the US, the price for labor and delivery is almost impossible to find out before it happens. I decided to try it out--to see if I could get a number of how much my wife's birth would cost before it happened. This video is the story of what happened.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

And she’s pregnant.When\nyou have a baby, there are lots of costs to consider. Isabel: Carseat, and a bassinet,\na baby carrier, thermometer. Johnny: Wait, wait, but how much is the actual hospital\nbirth going to cost? Healthcare in the US is significantly more\nexpensive than in other countries. Some experts say that this is partly because consumers\ndon’t go around looking for prices comparing them between hospitals. Like they do when\nthey buy a car or anything else for that matter. So I decided it’d try it out. And see if\nthere was any way to discover in advance how much we would be paying for our baby’s birth.\nWhat happens next is at once depressing and horrifying, showing how broken and expensive\nthe American health care system is. There\'s no way I\'m the only person who\'s ever\nhad this question. Childbirth in the US is the number one reason why people go to the\nhospital. Almost 4 million women are going to give birth this year and most births are\nrelatively uncomplicated. So you would think that with such a common procedure the price\nwould be generally well known. VO: I wanted to know how much child birth\nusually costs, so I did what any good child of the internet would do I found this really disturbing study from\nthe Yale medical school .It analyzed almost 800,000 low risk deliveries in the US, looking\nfor the variation in cost just for the facilities, meaning the hospital rooms and supplies and\nstuff like that. For just the cost of the hospital room, this\nstudy found that the price varied between $1,189 and $11,986. So I realized I am going\nto have to go ask the specific hospital where my wife is giving birth figure this out. Every\nhospital has a giant list they call the chargemaster which details all the services they provide\nand what they cost. And each item and service in the hospital has a code. If a doctor spends\n20 minutes with you, that’s a different code and a different price than if they spent\n40 minutes with you. Your insurance company then negotiates a lower price for every single\nitem on the list. So when my wife goes into the hospital, The nurses have a bar code scanner\nthat they use to scan every item she will use. Everything from the IV tubes to the Ibuprofen\ngets scanned onto the bill. At the end of it all, they put all the codes and prices\nonto one piece of paper which they call a “claim"" and send it off the insurance. The\ninsurance looks at it and pays a certain percentage of it based on my policy. The hospital then\nsends the remaining balance to me. So I figured if I could get my hands on that master list\nof prices I could add up the price of the delivery. Right? Well it wasn’t that easy.\nI called the hospital where Isabel is going to give birth and got a message machine. So\nI decided to call a some other hospitals to see if anyone could give me general pricing\ninformation about the cost of birth. So my wife is pregnant. My wife is pregnant. My\nwife will be giving birth. My wife\'s pregnant and I\'m trying to get an idea of how much\ndifferent services cost. Items that would be on a bill. Different costs associated with\nlabor and delivery. Hospital: One moment. Ok give me one moment let me talk to my team\nlead. Certainly, let me connect you with the billing office. I can connect you with our\nfinancial coordinator. What I\'ll have to do is transfer you to the pricing line. I can\ntransfer you. Johnny: So now I\'m being transferred to another line. Or something. I don\'t know.\nThey\'re transferring me somewhere. Answer the phone. Message Machine: I will be out\nof the office until Monday February 18th. Johnny: I\'m going to hang up and try this\nagain. Message Machine: You\'ve reached the voicemail of Patient Priceline. I will be\nout of the office until February 18th. Johnny: Everyone\'s out of the office. All agents are\ncurrently busy with other customers. Currently, all of our operators are busy. I\'m sorry,\nextension 59 didn\'t answer. Mash up of hold messages. Johnny: No music this time? I just\nhave to sit her on hold with no music. I\'m just trying to see if I can get a number.\nHospital: You will not get a copy of that until after the procedure. Johnny: Ok. Do\nyou have that information though in terms of like how much certain items cost? Hospital:\nno, um they will not present the cost until after. Johnny: So there\'s literally no way\nfor me to discover what the cost is until after I buy is that right? Hospital: We do\nnot keep that information on hand. Everything is processed after. Johnny: Certainly that\ninformation exists in your hospital system somewhere. Hospital: The itemized copy, all\nof that information is done after the procedure, not before. Johnny: I haven\'t heard a single\nnumber from anyone about how much anything costs. This is actually starting to become\nfrustrating. Finally, after two weeks and thirty phone calls I got ahold of a pricing\nconsultant from the hospital where Isabel\'s going to give birth. I finally just got a\ncall back from a pricing consultant I wasn\'t able to record it because she called me out\nof the blue. She had taken down all my insurance information and was able to run it through\nher system and come up with an estimate quote. And finally for the first time in two weeks,\nI heard a number. She said I would be paying $347 for my wife\'s birth. She wasn\'t able\nto give me a breakdown of what that meant or any items specifically. She was able to\nonly give me that number. And when I pushed on certain items she said she frankly didn\'t\nknow. Apparently prices in a hospital are beyond even a pricing consultant. And then\none day, this happened. I think Izzy may be going into labor. Here we go. I forgot about\nhealthcare prices for a moment and watched my amazing wife go through a night of painful\nlabor. She was the hero of the night and at the end of it, we had a new member of our\nlittle family. Oliver was born with no complications and a two day stay in the hospital. All very\ntypical. Well, I got the bill back in the mail The insurance negotiated a lower--[Oliver\ncries]. So the bill that came to us--[Oliver cries] So the bill that came to -- [Oliver\ncries]. Isabel: We got the final bill back and the hospital charged sixteen thousand\ndollars. The negotiated price with the insurance company was eight thousand dollars. They covered\n90% of it and sent us the bill for $841 dollars. Johnny: That\'s 500 dollars more than the pricing\nconsultant quotes me for a typical, uncomplicated birth which is what Isabel had. Our healthcare\nsystem suffers from a big problem which is that there\'s huge variation in costs. But\nwhat seems to be the bigger problem is that us consumers have no tools to find out where\nwe fall in that pricing variation. The hospital down the street could be a fairly cheap hospital\nor it could be an extremely expensive one--it could be 10 time more expensive than the cheap\nones. You have no idea and there\'s no way to tell. And hopefully someday this will change.\nBut in the meantime, we got a really cute baby out of this whole thing. So, I\'m not\ncomplaining. Thank you for for calling the patient Priceline.\nAt this time we are assisting other callers. But your call is important to us. Please speak\nclearly and leave your name and a number where you can be reached and someone will return\nyour call within...']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WIRED",WIRED,FaCeZsOOKEY,"[""41 take one marker Oh greetings everyone Bill Nye here once again to answer your science questions this is science support part 3 James Ravel asks how come we know more about space than we do about our own ocean I heard that on the dock somewhere well if you heard it on a documentary James I guess you're set no okay there's an old saying but it's easier to explore the moon than the bottom of the ocean that's true for three reasons the ocean is cold it's crushing and it's corrosive that's why it's easier with binoculars to explore the moon than it is with a scuba mask from a department store and just observe the bottom of the ocean carry-on James David Blanche flower BSc he asks now that tardigrades have settled on the moon I wonder what their future holds will they successfully rehydrate can they flourish in thousands of years will they build spaceships and return to Earth fascinating oh there's a picture he's got a picture of a tardigrade tardigrades also called the water-bearer you can see them with your naked eye you said Nick oh my god words settled I think crash landing in the harsh vacuum of space on a planetary body that has no atmosphere or liquid water I think that's not the same as settling I don't think they're gonna settle the moon David carry on Bill Nye assuming a perfect scenario where the general disasters don't occur if the earth stopped spinning would we all feel dizzy I guess so Matt attest you'll probably be able to run Tony Phillips writes a climate change question as it gets hotter more air conditioning is used heating up the air even more is there a way to cool indoor spaces without heating up the outdoors especially in cities well Tony probably not because what is the one thing you can count on in this universe that's right Tony the second law of thermodynamics heat just spreads out man so when you pump the heat out of this room or the balloon you're sitting on putting outside the outside gets a little bit warmer but the scale of it hope surprises you the amount of heat we pump out of buildings ain't no nothing compared to with the amount of heat that we're holding in by adding greenhouse gases to the Earth's atmosphere the heat island effect of cities is as more from hard scape paved surfaces buildings are not soil for example and that's why cities are so hot the AC thing is a problem but it's just the hardscape that gets us and that flippin second law of thermodynamics I'm sorry whoa man there's nothing we can do out there we got a deal it's entropy entropy killing us all hollow rights when will teleportation happen I don't know happens all the time in science fiction but that's fiction no it's just the information problem alone probably makes heliport ation impossible converting something like u into a beam of electromagnetic signals it's very very unlikely just taking you apart and putting you back together would take extraordinary amounts of energy ELISA asks honestly I have a science degree and a partially completed doctorate and I still have no idea what a neutron does ok neutrons can make things massive men and if you confuse them together you can release a whole bunch of energy which we hope is the future Liam asks if the mantle is filled with lava why aren't the oceans boiling or at least warmer than they are there's a couple things first of all that the oceans are not boiling and the earth remains very warm inside is evidence of an aphorism I hope you will embrace a saying a way of looking at the world that I hope you Liam will take to heart if things were any other way things would be different and here's what we mean by that indeed the earth does radiate a large amount but relatively small amount of heat into the icy blackness of space the bottom of the ocean is the Earth's crust you got to go down and they're ten twenty thirty kilometres most places to get to the mental carry on Liam bill life aliens were to fly by light-years away would they see the dinosaurs of the Trojan War or something since light they see is so old yes they would spur key Bill Nye this is drew asks Bill Nye why does the mean reflect in one straight line when it hits the ocean it may interest you to know that it reflects in all different directions when it hits the ocean just you as the observer see a straight line and if you don't believe me get your friends to stand in the line along the beach where you can call out to each other and ask each other if you each see a straight line and then ask yourself they're parallel or if you don't trust your friends and I don't blame you set up cameras take pictures along a kilometer or two carry on drew Andrew Ralston says okay okay I'll say how the planes work and I presume by that Andrew you mean airplanes because the Carpenters plane has a blade and you push it along the carpenter pushes it along and peels up the wood but an airplane works like a bird you get the momentum of air molecules going down hasn't produces enough force to hold the wing up and the way you get air molecules going down is get the wing going fast what about a helicopter helicopter is wings that are spinning and the propeller blades either the exposed ones that you might see on what we would call a propeller aircraft or the turbine blades inside the tubes on a jet airplane are they're going around in a circle and they're pushing air molecules back so fast that they push the airplane forward it's not magic its science Gogi Rossum's asks I'm doing my best to pronounce your name go gyro sons Bill Nye if we took all the animals out of the ocean how much shallower do you think the ocean would get in other words how much water do you animals displace I'll bet it's less than you think animals like you and I are mostly water animals that live in the ocean are almost all water I don't think it would change that much since you asked how much do you think my answer is not much carry on go Jiro Suns drew asked Bill Nye do you think aliens actually exist so you want me to resist making a joke about my old boss I don't know if he was an alien there are 200 billion stars in our galaxy and there are at least that many galaxies when I was in school it was speculated that there what might be a planet a single planet around one and every hundred stars now with observations from Hubble Space Telescope Kepler space telescope other inferential methods people think there probably about ten planets around every star so that's another factor of a thousand that takes you into the to trillions in just our galaxy if you got two trillion of anything you got to figure something's going to happen so there probably are aliens through the cinturón and do fabulous and important Twitter style podcasts I don't know maybe carry on aerobic and reek because he says the asus or she says the H is silent are you an alien bill sent here to educate the human race and save us from our own destruction yes I am an alien has been I've been sent here like the landing party that that one astronaut claims he believes in no I'm not an M one of you I'm one of us we're all in this together links shall kill 89 Bill Nye how does fusion work do you think we'll be able to have fusion power plants where we use nuclear power plants for 2050 fusion works by overcoming what's called the strong nuclear force the strong nuclear interaction and I believe it is quite reasonable we will have fusion not by running a stream of protons into deuterium or tritium oh no but by running a stream of neutrons into boron hydride gas stay tuned kc Kooning writes bill nye I've been fascinated and quite obsessed parenthetically with the alternate parallel universe theory oh you know that theory that theory about the alternate parallel universe so my question is this if such a thing where exists with the laws of physics necessarily have to apply to every single universe well so here's the thin KC let's let's just take history of physics for example people got by they built pyramids they built they discovered round things roll made wheels all kinds of agriculture was developed without really formalizing the laws or rules of physics or natural laws and so people presume that they knew what we call Newton's laws of motion were it for centuries and it was great we made all sorts of progress but then relativity was discovered and then quantum electrodynamics and we refined the laws of physics people when you're sophomoric view of the world the Isaac Newton was wrong I think was pretty flippin right but then was we made more discoveries about the nature of mass and white and quantum electrodynamics we refined it so I presume if another universe exists and it has what we might call different laws of physics it doesn't mean that our laws of physics are necessarily wrong it just means they're incomplete every day we learn a little more Terry on kacie Brian Schmidt asks didn't I hear we could get to the next habitable planet in a few years with this space sail just need to say all the size of Texas in order to do it say all the size of Texas is not going to take us to another inhabitable when in a few years but solar sails such as light sail too may revolutionize space exploration here in the solar system because we can go to extraordinary speeds with no rocket fuel there are certain missions that solar sails are ideal for put a solar sail spacecraft at an inferior orbit closer to the Sun than the earth is and keep an eye out for asteroids or maybe more importantly importantly coronal mass ejections from the Sun which send a beam of charged particles slashing through space toward the earth which could disable many many of our communication systems so there are certain missions that solar sails are ideal for but a texas-sized one going to a nearby habitable planet is probably not among them and I remind you that it's not the solar wind it's not particle streaming from the Sun that give a solar sail spacecraft to push it is light itself photons there's about a hundred times more pressure from photons than charged particles fascinating I hope carry on Brian bill nighy do insects feel gravity the same way we do yes the spider-man does whatever a spider can of course the spiders aren't insects but he doesn't do it because his understanding of gravity is different he does it because because he's not real thank you for your questions we'll be back with more science support number four coming soon and when it does turn it up

differences were I'm Mike Massimino and this is how hygiene is different in space [Music] hygiene in space is very important you're gonna have to do the same sort of things that you do want earth like brushing your teeth and keeping yourself clean using the bathroom all of these things are very important and very different because you're doing them in space so they do require some training and you want to do it correctly because if you don't it could lead to trouble on earth we deal with flush toilets if that's available hopefully to you you do what you need to do and then you clean yourself up then it's on to the remainder of your day but in space it's different the flights that I had in space were on the space show and on the space shuttle we had a lavatory it was called the WCS the waste containment system I think that was primarily because if he had a problem you didn't want to call houston we have a problem we messed up the toilet it didn't have a lot of privacy but it had some it had a privacy curtain and the WCS had a hose for urine for you to urinate into and a commode more or less for you to poop into and we want to use the word poop what do you want to poops okay we're not gonna offend then he went around a planet here okay taking a pee on the Space Shuttle was was pretty pretty quick and easy the holes came with an attachment that you would put on which was a funnel so everyone had their own we didn't share funnels and it was in a little compartment and you'd open up the compartment and there would be the seven funnels and you would take the appropriate one and attach it to the urine collection hose and then you would turn the system off what it does is it creates a little airflow so that it'll take the liquid down the hose and into the tank and when that tank reached a level that it was full we would do a urine dump out into space it would kind of crystallize and disappear more or less in the vacuum of space so it was okay to dump to dump urine out there if the Sun was shining who was shining through the dumped urine and beauty kind of like a rainbow effect and that was kind of cool and when you were finished you would then turn off the system you would remove your funnel you would clean it and you would put it back in its appropriate space then you would clean up a little bit the quickest way to do that was just a wet wipe we had hand sanitizer you could use some of that cause you don't want to spread any germs or anything like that you want to be very cautious after you get a little experience you could do other things like peeing upside down this was a challenge given to me by a more experienced astronaut who said it is possible to pee upside down you should try it and you can you just flip yourself upside down I need to be a little more careful you don't want to do that on day one you know you don't want a hot dog it too much but it is possible to pee upside down which is kind of cool I've done that as well people on the space station is a little bit different than what we had on the space shuttle you still pee into a hose but unlike these individual funnels it's a big yellow funnel in one size fits all but on the space station they recycle the urine along with recycling sweat and condensation all that water is collected and then it is cleaned and it is treated and it is reused so as my friend Don Pettit says today's coffee is tomorrow's coffee pooping in space was very involved because you really don't want to mess this up this is our orbital outhouse right here I'll show you but you see it's pretty small so you have to have pretty good aim the key to this the way it was explained to us and I agree the key to this is alignment next to our real shuttle toilet in the simulator we had a practice toilet that was not for defecating it was made for alignment practice this is actually one of NASA's deepest darkest secrets that we're going over here and this camera pointed up at you when you sat on this you had a call circuit TV right here so you would see on the camera whether or not you were aligned with the target area you would sit on there like you went on maybe on it like you think you're on a regular on a regular toilet in here and then you check you're alive like whoa-ho I'm go we're near where I want to be on this and when you get yourself perfectly aligned the idea was to then try to memorize what that body position was so on the front of this thing there were like little platform to put your feet underneath okay as you're sitting on this thing but you can still you but could still come off the back of it and that's not good so in order to keep you but on the toilet seat we had these two little arms that would press you into the seat actually to help myself get the right position as I put my arms up like this like I was riding a chopper I thought of Peter Fonda in a movie called Easy Rider that wasn't good alignment for me after you take care of business we had a couple things to watch out for we had a mirror that we would be trained to then take from there was velcro to the wall we would take this mirror and then put it behind us so as we got off the toilet we saw if anything was following us if you get that what I mean okay and if there was something following you you would sit back down and do whatever you think was necessary to make sure whatever was following you off the seat remained where am I supposed to do you do a little shake if you need to and then if things get really out of control we have disinfectant wipes just to make sure we clean up here the number-one stuff can sort of go all over the place if you don't aim correctly the poop remained in the toilet we landed with all of our poop and then the toilet was serviced once we got on the ground and on occasion people had messed up the procedure and therefore broken the toilet and that's really bad if you break the toilet and you can't poop in the toilet on a space shuttle the backup to that was what we called Apollo bags that had adhesive that you would tape to your butt that's the way they pooped in Apollo they did not have a regular toilet to use and that seemed extremely unpleasant right so we did not want to get into the Apollo bags and so that was kind of like enough to scare you you would make sure you did the procedure correctly on earth cleanliness is very important what most of us do is we'll take a shower every day brush your teeth very important to brush your teeth brush your hair we need to shave but in space it's a little different water is somewhat of a resource particularly on the space station and so we want to conserve what we have and a big shower would use with these those lots of water so we really can't afford to do that so what we did in space and what the astronaut still do in space is you take more of a sponge bath where you have one washcloth that you would put a little water on and then you could put some soap into it and then soap yourself off this is our body wash so there's soap inside of here we would fill this just like a drink bag as a valve at the top and we can squeeze the liquid soap out of it after we added water to it and then you would hang all of those things up to dry the ventilation system the circulation of air will allow it to dry in space space is a problem so the washcloths we use were packed very tightly on the space station now they have ones they look like almost like a hockey puck with NASA autumn there the wash clothes are kind of cool but you want to pack them as tightly as you can and the towels we have these big fluffy towels you can get on earth that's that happening in space they're generally thinner towels but pretty absorbent so they work really well the use of water is so important for our life having clean water in a lot of places don't have clean water source right so we have this problem in space where we need to have water to live for drinking for hygiene and for preparing food because a lot of our food items are dehydrated so you add a little bit of water to those and so we've done a good job of learning how to effectively recycle water and be able to clean urine and water we use for different things so that it's usable again and so that is the type of technology that can be very useful and in parts of the world where getting clean water is an issue washing our hair usually requires a lot of water on earth but in space we use rinse less shampoo the Heron is right there it's got velcro on it if I wanted to put it down I could stick it to the wall and it's got a piece of Kapton tape on the top so it won't leak Kapton tape is space approved tape so what I did was add a little bit of water to a wash cloth and then rinse with shampoo and then get a good lather going and then again take a towel and and just dry off my hair with the tile and it worked great because you didn't have to rinse her hair that way you generally used your own washcloth and towel that was somewhat of a personal item yeah shaving the way I shave on earth I use shaving cream and a and a razor on the sink and that requires running water you can do that in space and they do have a special shaving cream you can use they call it astro edge and you can also use a razor but then you've got to do something with the cream and the whiskers that are coming off what I opted for was an electric razor and the whiskers were contained in the unit itself and then you would clean it if you needed to very carefully with a vacuum we generally get a haircut pretty close at a time that we're gonna fly in space on the space station you're up there for six months and so you need to be concerned about a haircut and so for that to have an electric Clipper again that's attached directly to a vac so that as you create hair it'll get sucked right into the vacuum stuff like dead skin cutting your fingernails or toenails you want to do that stuff near the vent so that it gets captured by the vent and then you can clean it off this was a toothbrush that I took with me to space NASA could provide you with the standard government-issue toothbrush but if you provided one of your own they would pack it for you and fly it and you could use that in space if he had a favorite toothbrush so I saw this as an opportunity to do something fun so I went out and purchased this astronaut toothbrush to have in space and NASA then converted it to a space toothbrush by putting a piece of velcro on it in space you brush your teeth the same way more or less you used toothbrush and toothpaste and then you rinse your mouth but then the question is what do you do with that stuff and there are two options you can either be a spitter or a swallower if you're a spitter I felt that was a little more complicated because you have to you know spin into a washcloth and deal with it so what I do is I just swallow the toothpaste space sounds glamorous doesn't it I wear contact lenses and even spacewalk with my contact lenses some guys didn't want to do that but I always warm I figured you know as long as I wasn't messing with my eyes I'd be ok there was a concern though with the docks about us having clean hands when we put the contacts in and so he had wipes and I guess you can use on earth as well if you were concerned I did not lose a contact in space I felt very fortunate that the nab to do laundry on earth is fairly straightforward then we have machines that help us but in space it's different because we don't have a lot of water in space it is hard to wash clothes on the space shuttle we had a different shirt everyday and we had a different pair of underwear every day and we had pants and shorts that would be worn for a few days and so we didn't do laundry we just packed that stuff up once we wore the shirt and we put it in a kind of a clothing bin but it was like a big bag and then that stuff would be returned to Earth and and cleaned and returned to us clean on the space station they kind of rely on the supply ships to bring them the new clothes the dirty laundry will get packaged put into a supply ship and has been emptied of supplies and now becomes a dumpster and that stuff will burn up under the entry it does however on occasion get stinky in space what you smell in space in the cabin is generally each other when we landed on the shuttle after this situation for a few weeks the people that would open up the hatch would get a whiff of this and be like was usually the reaction the more experienced recovery technicians would know that ahead of time and be prepared for you go to your spacesuit to spacewalk that becomes your individual spacecraft it does not come with its own toilet the rule was on spacewalking days the two people going out to spacewalk have first dibs on the toilet you want it take care of that as best you can before you go out and then you put your diaper on to make it astronaut proof some nice person who packs our stuff writes front on the diapers so we don't put it on backwards and then we put our fancy cooling garment on and then we start getting dressed with the rest of the space you know once you're locked inside of there you have no access to the toilet any longer so if you're gonna go you're gonna do it in the in the diaper and you're really discouraged from pooping in that thing because you really don't want that stuff getting loose in there and the diapers should work but why take the risk when we were launching on the space shuttle we were going to be putting a diaper on as well and when we got dressed so you'd want to use the bathroom at crew quarters and then you put on your spacesuit with a diaper and you go out to the launch pad now on the launch pad itself there is a toilet we call it the last toilet on earth because you use it and then you go to space the last thing you do before you go flying or go into a simulator where you're gonna be stuck is you go to the bathroom it's part of the checklist we do have a thermal control so you try to keep yourself cool while you're spacewalking so you don't sweat profusely but still you're gonna be moving around and you're gonna be sweating a bit one thing you learn in aviation as you go to different altitudes things are going to expand meaning your stomach I remember the the who was a Navy guy that was training us in this and he said your social graces go out the window when you're in get inside of the airplane you know you might have some extra gas so he said you don't worry about that you because you don't want to get a stomachache and so the same thing is in your spacesuit but if you break wind inside of your spacesuit you're the only guy that's going to be smelling it and you won't smell it I think for the future hygiene of course is gonna be important on the spatial it was a short-term issue you know you could contain all the poop for a couple weeks on the space station now they have a better plan because you're up there longer periods of time but still the proximity to the earth gives you some advantages you can get resupplied of clothing you can get resupplied of water you can get resupplied of a lot of the things you need because we're in low Earth orbit once we start moving further away from the planet it's going to be harder to do that and resupply it's not going to be as easy as it is now so I think we are going to need a way to wash clothes when we go further away from our planet and we're going to need a way to do that that doesn't require a lot of water also we're able to contain a lot of the the germs of bacteria we try to go to space very healthy you have a quarantine period ahead of time so you don't have that we have just about every medicine imaginable available to us hygiene wise but eventually as we get further and further away that may be more of an issue as well of containing some of the contaminants bacteria if you're very far away from Earth you're going to have to solve that problem on your own so I think dealing with germs cleanliness and resupply are gonna be a bigger issue as we go forward where you're gonna need to take all your toothpaste with you or figure out a way to make it or something so we've got to think about these issues as you move forward [Music]

Through thought-provoking stories and videos, WIRED explores the future of business, innovation, and culture.Astronaut Chris Hadfield Debunks Space Myths | WIRED",WIRED,t6rHHnABoT8,"[""five four three two one hi I'm commander Chris Hadfield astronaut spaceship commander space Walker part-time musician I'm here today to hopefully debunk some common space myths here's this common perception that you will immediately fry to a crisp by the unfiltered unadulterated solar radiation if you get sucked out of the airlock in truth it's way worse than that in the shade in space it's like minus 250 degrees but the part of you that's in the Sun it's plus 250 degrees at least so it's gonna start boiling and burning so it's like lying on a red-hot stove with a piece of dry ice on your back and your lungs are gonna be sucked flat instantaneously but even worse than that is your blood is gonna boil like opening a can of pop where suddenly that all the little bubbles come out because there's no air pressure around you so simultaneously you are going to freeze boil burn get the bends and no longer be able to breathe not a good way to go I've done two spacewalks and I was very thankful to have a spacesuit around my body so that none of those things that happen to me [Music] sometimes you hear that you have to work out constantly or you will pass out and possibly die in space not true living on a spaceship is the most lazy existence you can imagine you're weightless you do not have to lift a finger you don't have to hold your head up your heart doesn't have to lift your blood against gravity you can be the laziest person in the universe in space but eventually you need to come back to earth and if you don't exercise for your whole 6 months in space you're sort of turn into a jellyfish so we do exercise two hours a day on a spaceship we have a resistive machine we have a unicycle and we have a treadmill where elastics hold us down just to keep our bodies strong enough and our bones dense enough so when we get home we don't just fall over like a pole but you don't need to work out you've probably heard that space has a smell maybe like burnt steak or some type of barbecue that's true when you come in from a spacewalk you're surrounded by the emptiness of space it's sort of like the opposite of air there's nothing there at all when you quickly repressurize the hatch and you open up the hatch and you smell what is that lingering smell from a place that used to be exposed to space but smell in there is a little bit like that trace of a smell of gunpowder or a burnt steak or to me it's sort of like brimstone like a which has just been there it's a cool lingering trace of a smell I think what it really is is the emptiness of space the vacuum of space is actually pulling trace chemicals out of the metal of the walls of the ship little bits of stuff you never smell because normally there's air pressure holding them into the metal they're slowly off gassing those tiny little trace gasses and trace particles that otherwise they never get into your nose and those are released sort of that metallic gunpowder fired smell that's where the smell is coming from maybe it's not even coming from space it's just sort of coming from spaces effect on our ship yeah in truth smells a little bit like a burnt steak so there's a lot of word out there that if you go incredibly fast like the speed of light if you could travel at the speed of light that you won't age and despite thousands of years going by you'll stay the same but everybody that you know will die that's not really true Einstein called it relativity because what he meant was your aging will be different relative to people's aging on earth you'll still age time will still pass for you but people on earth will age at a different rate so that if you came back after going incredibly fast you would have gotten older by the amount of time that it took for you to travel but people on earth would have aged much much faster they would have had a longer period of time because even get going fast enough your speed is sort of proportional to the time passing so you'll still age but you just ain't a different rate than people back on earth Einstein did this cool thought experiment imagine if you were looking at a clock that the light from the clock is coming and hitting your eyeballs and telling you it's 12 o'clock I'll imagine if you could move away from that clock at the speed of light it would only say 12 o'clock because that light and you would be moving away from the clock at the same speed so for you it would look like it was always 12 o'clock forever you'd still be getting older but that clock would always look like it was the same time the people on earth were continuing to live they're not aware of you go on the speed of light so you can see that the time for you because of your speed is relatively different than the time for the people on earth it's a really unusual thing to try and grasp in your head what happens when something blows up in space if something explodes in space will it make a sound and could a human hear it it's a pretty easy question to answer the Sun is just an explosion the Sun is the biggest explosion any of us can imagine it's a huge continuous thermonuclear explosions every atom bomb we've ever built way more than that continuously exploding it would be the loudest thing imaginable it's constantly happening but we don't hear a whisper of it and that's because there's nothing to carry the sound from the Sun to us even though it's incredibly violent there's nowhere for the pressure of all of that sound all of that noise to be carried across the emptiness of space to shake my eardrum in and let me hear the sound of the Sun it's a good thing it'd be deafening so if something explodes in space it makes sound but there's no way for that sound to be carried across space so that I could hear there is this idea out there that maybe the only way that we could really create gravity is to spin the spaceship so that everybody is stuck to the sides like one of those rides at the fair where you're pinned against the wall and for now that's actually true we don't know how to control gravity we have no way to control gravity we can sort of pretend there's gravity by spinning a ship and everything stick to the sides like a ball on the end of a string maybe someday we'll figure out how to control gravity but for now we have to spin the whole ship only in the middle would they be weightless I've seen that people think that NASA is working on warp speed so that we can travel at the speed of light to interstellar planets warp speed is an invention of science fiction if we knew how to work on warp speed we would we don't know how to go anywhere near the speed of light it takes an unlimited amount of energy the faster you go the more energy it takes a equals MC squared it goes up with the square of the speed in fact so how can you generate that much electricity and what does it do to your mast we don't know we think maybe it's possible that you could go faster than the speed of light but we sure don't understand how right now so we're not really working on it so it's not really true we're hoping for in so many movies you see that the only way that they survive interstellar travel from one star to another is to freeze yourself into cryo sleep we don't know how to do that right now when you freeze water which is what we're mostly made of our blood and everything it goes into crystals it turns into ice crystals and if you allow the beautiful delicate nature of your human body to expand into ice crystals it'll destroy the structure of you it'll kill you you know frostbite destroys it so that you get gangrene in your hand you'd end up with entirely destroyed body so right now we do not know how to successfully freeze a human body so that it is not going to be permanently destroyed maybe we'll figure it out someday but all of those movies that rely on freezing the crew we don't know how to do that it's not real you see on the internet all the time someone has built a balloon and they've launched some little figurine with a camera attached to it where they take a picture way up high in the atmosphere you can see the curvature of the earth it's pretty cool but there's some people thinking you could fly yourself all the way up to the stratosphere with some sort of high-altitude balloon you can actually but it's really complicated Felix Baumgartner when he did his his leap out of a balloon and actually go through the speed of sound falling down towards the Earth and landing with a parachute he was way up into the stratosphere the stratosphere starts at about six or seven miles up it's not all that high then that goes on for a long way there's not enough air to breathe you kind of need to have an airliner with the pressure inside to keep your body healthy if you're that high but if you take the right equipment with you yes we can use a balloon to lift us high enough to get all the way up into the stratosphere so if you have the right equipment it's true you've probably read somewhere on the internet that if you go to the Space Station your body will get taller sort of expand and it'll be painful and you're gonna be taller forever an irreversible experience and it's not really true as I'm standing here talking right now gravity is pushing me down towards the floor every single bone in my body and a little bit of gristle that's in between the bones like each of the vertebra of my back everyone has a little disk in between each of the bones and even my hip bones on my knee bones there's a little bit of a gap well if there's no gravity pushing me down and those gaps can all get a tiny bit bigger if you stay in weightlessness for a few weeks in fact your body just sort of stretches because the gap between each of the bones gets a little bigger and in my case I got about that much taller but you aren't really taller you're just sort of temporarily longer but it's not permanent as soon as you get home and gravity starts doing its its work on you and grinding you down everything squishes back down to its launch so you maybe for a little while a little bit taller in space and it may hurt your back a little cuz everything's sort of getting pulled tight some people have back pain in space as a result but it's not really growing it's just sort of stretching to your natural maximum that you're gonna get squished back again as soon as you get home if you do get maybe that much longer after you've been in space for a few weeks think what your pants would be like you're you know they're gonna they're gonna be high above your ankle and if you put on a spacesuit who custom-fit the spacesuit to the size of your body but we know it's going to happen so we actually plan in advance we fit our spacesuits knowing that the astronauts are gonna be a little bit taller when they're in space or at least their bodies are gonna be a little bit stretched and even the seat that protects us when we come back to earth the crash seat so that when we hit the ground it protects us properly we allow for the fact that our back bones are gonna be slightly longer when we're up there but your clothes you don't really know how they fit because you're floating around weightless your shirt is always floating around your body so you never really have a sense up there how well your clothes fit just because there's no gravity to pull them down and look and see how well they're fitting on your body it's more like they're just floating next I've read somewhere that onboard the International Space Station bacteria multiplies ten times faster in space so if you get sick your body is gonna be like torn apart by this ravenous strain of mutant Salmonella now it is a different place than Earth the space station we run around with little swabs all the time to measure what microbes and what viruses and what little tiny bits of life might be growing on the spaceship we also go around with little cleaners and wet wipes and wipe down the whole space station all the time like in a hospital to try and keep the whole thing clean and hygienic and we are finding that some of those primitive forms of life do mutate slightly differently in the high radiation weightless environment of the spaceship but no one has died yet because of the mutant Salmonella I'm Chris Hadfield hopefully this has helped answer some of those comments

WIRED",WIRED,JcI8yn7xQWo,"[""so I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson your personal astrophysicist and I was invited in with these fun props like inflated planets to answer questions your questions about the universe so bring it on [Music] questions from the internet I got one here from Cain Jackson how many stars are born per year how many died well it's about a hundred a year in our galaxy we've had like a stable amount for the last several billion years and where you calculate that is we have about a hundred billion stars in the galaxies and universes ten or so billion years old about a hundred a year maybe ten and a hundred a year so you got it next up from Maccabees dude love questions that begin with dude there's literally a quark called strangeness because nobody freaking knows what the hell it's doing but what is going on damn I hate physics that's not a question we have quarks named up-down bottom top strange and charmed we don't see them directly we can't tell you what we can't show you a photo of them so they're just placeholder words for them so just like just get used to that all of quantum physics transcends our personal life experience so to describe it we have to sort of invent words one of them is just strange that doesn't mean we can't describe it and know what it how it behaves in and of itself and with other quarks so don't put too much meaning in the word itself it's the idea that matters next Jordan is it just a coincidence the two major hurricanes a spreading wildfire and now in 8.4 magnitude earthquake followed the solar eclipse yes by the way there's solar eclipses every 18 months or so find something to happen there and you want to blame it on the eclipse okay go ahead people did that for millennia no no what do we have here a dagger a p.m. if dark energy makes the universe expand it makes it might make more or new space can we use that space to make dark energy um I I don't know by the way dark energy is not so much making us expand we were already expanding it is making the expanding universe accelerate that's what's going on evidence shows that dark energy is not being created in the expansion of the universe so I think the answer to this is no but if one day we could control dark energy in a lab maybe we might discover interesting properties in its relationship to dark matter I don't know to be determined watch this space next up on Twitter charles william johnson if the Higgs boson etc forms an essential part of reality which it does why can't it be found in our front room or all around us there's certain parts of our fundamental reality that you only gain access to under certain conditions of pressure and temperature and energy you don't experience a proton in your life but it's a fundamental part of nuclei that make up the atoms that comprise your body so just because you don't see it feel it touch it taste it or smell it does not mean it does not exist and part of the entire purpose of why we have science at all in particular the methods and tools of science is to decode that which is true about nature that otherwise transcends your sensory perceptions that is what science is you wouldn't need the tools if our brain sensory system accurately decoded the world around us but it doesn't and that's why science tries to find any way it can to remove your brain ie R nose mouth touch from the operation and the more we can successfully do it the less bias shows up in the result just get the human out of it so yeah reality is not what you perceive it's what the methods and tools of science reveal next up Wow across the universe is a musical I don't know is it I love musicals if it is I'm embarrassed that I haven't heard of it but it ought to be seems to me the universe would be really good next Marilyn Baker what is a quantum particle is it like say a quark where's an electron what quantum physics is the study of everything that matters on that scale electrons quarks neutrons nuclei themselves atoms themselves molecules themselves there is no understanding of what they do without quantum physics that's how small particles roll in this world hope that answers your question within these hundreds of newly confirmed exoplanets how many are possibly habitable by the actual scientific method we have so you look for exoplanets planets orbiting other stars some fraction of them are in the Goldilocks zone not too close if it had liquid water would evaporate not too far they haven't had liquid water would freeze now you can calculate what that is for any star and so there's a subset of all the thousands of exoplanets there's a few hundred that orbit in the Goldilocks zone life as we know it could thrive there haven't found life still looking for life but it could thrive there by the way there are other sources of heat sources of heat from tides that are created from the main planet Jupiter for example on to its moons so there are moons of Jupiter Jupiter's way outside the Goldilocks zone the moons of Jupiter are kept warm by this sort of gravitational massaging it's called tidal heating tid Al tidal heating so you might have life as we know it on the moons of planets that have tidally heated those moons so that opens the net forecast a much wider net in a search for life in the universe I'm not sure if anyone has asked or answered but I'm curious where was Neil Tyson for the solar eclipse hopefully it was a clear sky thank you for those warm wishes it was a state secret where I was right up until the Eclipse I was at deadwood lookout 7,200 feet up in the mountains of Idaho checking out the total solar it is the universe expanding into a space bigger than the universe itself is there a clear limit to the expansion so yeah we're expanding but if that's what we define all of space to be then there's higher dimensions into which this is happening in principle you can go outside of our universe and look down on it or up to it but then you're in another dimension so we don't have access to that dimension so we're stuck we did dimension you're given three spatial one time dimension get over time for just a couple more whatever a Donnie yell if aliens exist how do I know I'm not one well if you visited another planet with life you'd be an alien to them clearly you're probably not an alien because you share all the same organs in the same place with the same biochemistry and highly common DNA with the person sitting across from you and everyone else walking this earth you have DNA in common with yeast cells with an apple with oak trees so that's some of the best evidence we know that you yourself are not an alien Jacob Warren you all believe in quantum mechanics or a theory of relativity which one is better you don't have that choice they each exist and work and make predictions that are verified they're both kind of crazy but they apply to reality now it turns out we already know the limits of relativity it can't describe the center of a black hole so we know relativity will have to be extended or modified in those extremes to understand that quantum physics quantum mechanics it works every single place we have ever applied it every single place so in that regard it is the most successful theory of the universe that has ever been put forth it could be possible that in the future quantum physics will subsume relativity entirely to get you to those singularities the center of the black hole and the beginning of the universe but right now they both work and we're completely happy with them last one naphthalene Twitter so the theory of relativity the prediction of the effects gravitational fields in space than peace I think the rise of science has promoted greater peace and prosperity in the world certainly prosperity and often where there's prosperity there's less of a need to take your neighbor's stuff if you look at the era of science and look at the kinds of wars people fought and what fraction of people would die in a war of a culture in spite of even these aberrations such as the first and second world war a much smaller fraction of all humans died in those wars than who died in tribal wars if you go back thousands of years you could lose a third of your men fighting in a battle just to gain access to a property that does not happen in organized war no war is good of course but it may be that science as a path to prosperity and health will remove many of the reasons why we ever had war in the first place so a theory of relativity has another branch physics science in general peace yeah peace yes so very impressed with the cosmic curiosity out there keep them coming and as always keep looking up guys know about this especially a thermometer it's a closed system in this air in here room temperature is generally cooler than your body temperature this is why we have to eat continuously as warm-blooded creatures to maintain this temperature difference we're

the water fall off the water is held on the earth by gravity and get this so is the air wait there's more not only is the earth gravitationally pulling on the water the water is ever so slightly gravitationally pulling on the earth and sea this is Isaac Newton's insight he saw the Apple fall off the tree and he realized that not only is the earth somehow pulling the Apple down but the Apple is mutually gravitationally pulling the earth up like dude that's so out there I know I know miss misery how charming my dad I don't get the Internet seriously where does it come from how does it work the Internet is a system of computers and we are able to store information for example an alphabet or numbers can be represented by a code that everyone's agreed on and the code is a pattern or a system of binary bits this is to say either ons or offs and you sir miss misery's dad I'll bet you are of a certain age or you remember Morse code Morse codes the same thing it's either a dot or a dash a dit or a da so we've taken it to a whole nother level of dits and DAHS where we are able to store and transmit billions and trillions and quadrillions and sextillion z' of bits to represent language numbers calculations and you are part of this greater whole what a time to be alive man way to go Chelsea Briggs whoa did a meteor just hit my home state of Michigan everyone is calling me is the world coming to an end I would say based on my presence here or how you can't see it but there's a crew of camera and audio people here I don't think the world ended as we know it just judging in so far as you were able to send the text I bet the world didn't end for you either so once in a while a meteor streaks through the sky now for fun I'll give you these three words meteor means something streaking through the sky Meteor has to do with the sky in greek a meteorite is what you call it when it makes it all the way to the Earth's surface as an intact rock an asteroid is different a comet is different yes that's four words but yeah meteors come into our atmosphere streak through the sky all the time meteorites once in a while if you like to worry about things you're living at a great time because we discovered that the ancient dinosaurs were almost certainly wiped out by a great big asteroid or a cluster of asteroids mid-june wha why can't I walk through solid objects of all I made of his neurons protons and electrons so let me say I think you tossed in the word neuron when you may have meant Neutron but neurons enable you to think about this and keep in mind that protons and electrons are not all you're made of there's also some energy driving these things around making them interact and there are this fabulous subatomic particles the subatomic particles are in turn made of others even smaller particles quarks and so these things all interact and if you like to wonder about things this is a great thing we are made of protons neutrons and electrons and the reason you can't walk through solid objects the reason objects like you are solid is because these things especially the electrons repel each other so when you try to push on something the electrons repel each other so strongly that we perceive it as a solid object all the electrons neutrons and protons came together and they are almost entirely made of exploded ancient stars so you and I are made of Stardust you and I are at least one way that the universe knows itself oh I hope that fills you with reverence I hope you stop and think about that at least once every day middle school span teacher - drew are the seats in the front of the plane the best to avoid turbulence generally yeah especially swept-wing aircraft will do this and reminded some aeronautical engineers of a Dutch person on ice skates so traditionally it's called Dutch roll and you damp out the Dutch roll with the rudder on the vertical tail so yeah generally the front of an airplane is smoother than back but this is a pretty subtle effect in the modern world maybe on an old md80 or dc9 McDonnell Douglas - nine aircraft or maybe even on md80 and maybe even an old 707 you'd feel that but nowadays hardly ever why because of the coupling of stability and control and our understanding of computers and our ability to have computers to not only do position velocity acceleration and jerk but also snap whoa carry on sit wherever you like that Elisha underscore Blackburn writes does anyone really know how gravity works the answer is we know with extraordinary precision what gravity will do we can land spacecraft on Mars taking into account general and special relativity speed of the spacecraft and the influence of the Earth's gravity on the rate at which we perceive time passing we can take that into account to have your cell phone tell you which side of the street you're standing on we can do that but where gravity actually comes from remains a mystery Alicia Blackburn you are living at a time when we may discover how this happens last summer we built these big interferometry gravitational observatories and we observed the ripple of a very strong gravity wave all the other energy that we can come across like the energy the light that's bouncing off my head and going into this camera lens and then off your computer screen into you we understand that very well and we use waves to analyze this flow of energy well people who discovered relativity Einstein's the famous guy realize that gravity should perhaps also travel in waves and we could make predictions with that and we built these observatories and we've discovered them prove that they existed who knows what the future holds is an exciting time go wild Shea at Singer under Explorer 7 teen if trees produce oxygen then can't paper do the same thing if it's made out of trees I understand the premise of your question but compare how well a fish swims when it's alive with how well it swims after you've caught it and killed it we make paper out of dead trees dead trees don't move around as much and they don't produce nearly as much oxygen carry on che Jules watch them I was just thinking going that's good I'm glad Jules artificial intelligence becomes more intelligent we might want to stop using the term artificial to describe it I mean the best AI is one that learns itself right so is it really artificial either way let's not start off on the wrong foot heart symbol icon emoji thing artificial intelligence gets the term because humans created computers that act as though they are what you and I call intelligent for me the line that will be crossed is when our computer systems which are artificially intelligence choose to make art when our artificial intelligence decides to do something just for the sake of doing it then we will have cross the line into intelligence so right now I'd stick with AI and don't be freaked out about AI you get on a you go to an airport you get on the tram that takes you from terminal a to terminal C and you trust it because engineers have designed a system that figures out how much you weigh how much your luggage weighs how fast the door should open where it should stop how fast it should accelerate how fast it should slow down it's all that done and you trust it it's just the next few levels with the thing would get more and more complicated what we don't want is for worldwide systems of the artificial intelligence to become so sophisticated that we can't predict what they're going to do or there's there's so many moving parts you can't tell what's gonna happen that's what we don't want that's how we get blackouts and electrical grids and stuff but you're out there Jules you're thinking deep thoughts way to go at a yo Tristan did I just hear thunder in a snowstorm is that a thing yeah it's a thing thunderstorms happen when it's cold enough for snow to form and you know what you observe that yourself way to go yo chemo at yo C flow one three one five seven zero one two rites I have no pinky toe nail is this evolution you'll notice that an evolution was an interesting thing a fascinating thing a very important idea in evolution yokomo you don't have to be any better than you have to be this is to say there is no force no natural force no natural selecting pressure tab superpowers to have x-ray vision to be able to run faster than a speeding locomotive or leap tall buildings in a single bound there's no motivation for that naturally you only have to be good enough so if you're able to live your life put on shoes run marathons whatever you might do dance swing dances maybe the Balboa or the collegiate shag or East Coast Swing you can do all that without a toenail there's no evolutionary pressure for you to get one but it's a cool question and you know what else you can bet you really have one it's just the nail beds really small carry on at blenheim or older question : if hashtag climate change because the end of the last ice age was a good thing why is hashtag climate change today a bad thing can anyone explain first you know as we say in comedy by the premise by the bit what makes you think climate change the cause the ice age was a good thing oh can I get over there and what is now France they had it going on they lived in caves they hunted gathered and scavenged they had sex they carried on who knows what they buried their dead carefully well I was at a good thing everything got hot people started walking all over the earth I mean was that really good but why the reason climate change today is a bad thing is the speed it's the rate at which humans like you and I are causing climate change that's the problem you and I are causing climate change and it's the speed people are gonna have to abandon coastal cities as their floods come in more and more frequently the pests that infect our crops pests are showing up earlier and sticking around later it's the speed Lattimore alder that is the trouble and whether or not ice age ending was a good thing it depends on whom you ask go out there if go back in time take a meeting with OGG and I'll get and see if they thought it was great when there were mosquitoes all the time suck man at brunette love seven rights at till nine my boyfriend and I have been debating if water is wet to the convo conversation thinking it is but he is adamant water is not wet can you please explain the science trying to answer this question for me wet is sort of defined by water yeah so if there's water present it's generally gonna be wet with that set we in fluid mechanics think of air wetting the surface of a baseball or a bird's wing or an airplane way we talk about wedding and here's the definition of wedding from a fluid mechanical standpoint for your consideration Myra Brunetta it's when the fluid sticks to the surface air is a fluid anything it flows is a fluid so if it sticks to the surface then the surface is wetted so try this get a flask spin it with water in it spin it and you'll see the water takes on some of the spin of the glass because it's stuck to the surface take a ping-pong ball and give it a lot of spin either with a racquet a paddle or your fingers the AR sticking to the surface wetting the surface influences its flight but now whacks the hood of a car and put water droplets on it they beat up they don't wet the surface thank you for these questions I'm really glad you all are pondering these things I am NOT some brilliant guy okay I'm just scientifically literate but the questions so far have been addressed in science when you're very well understood and you and I depend on them that's why we have shapes made of glass and lenses and drinkable water and electronic

WIRED",WIRED,t93UCj1hzu8,"[""my name is Chris Hadfield I'm doing the wired autocomplete interview let's begin what Chris Hadfield in the search engine here we go what inspired Chris Hadfield to become an astronaut the first people to walk in the moon when Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in July 20th 69 I thought if they could do that I could do that that inspired me what was Chris Hadfield education I went to a bunch of different schools but basically I'm a farmer and mechanical engineer and a pilot fighter pilot test pilot that's was my education become an astronaut what was Chris Hadfield first job I grew up on a farm but when you growing up on a farm it's not really sort of a job was just what you do every day after school my first real job was working in a scientific shipping warehouse when a school ordered scientific equipment I was the guy back in in the shipping department that would collect the the pig fetuses or the the weigh scale put him in a box and and mail them to your school that was my first job what did Chris Hadfield find in space did I find in space a new way to look at the world what did Chris Hadfield this is terrible English what did Chris Hadfield learned from going blind well I learned better English from this sensor during my first spacewalk there was contamination inside my space they've gotten both my eyes blinded me what did I learn from that number one don't panic panic doesn't really help especially if you're all alone in space and the second was you need to do a better job of cleaning the visor of your space helmet because it was actually the anti-fog and the visor that good into my eyes that made me go in blind so remember if you're doing a spacewalk clean your visor really carefully and don't let it get in your eyes and you probably won't go blind emerging from below as often Scrolls on a computer screen these are the questions that begin with where where Chris Hadfield where does Chris Hadfield live I live on earth wasn't always true but right now I live in Toronto Ontario Canada and I like it there it's a nice city it's well-run good place you get a chance live in Toronto where was Chris Hadfield born I was born about I don't know maybe a couple hundred yards from the US border right on the edge of Canada in a town called Sarnia Ontario in Sarnia General Hospital August 29th 1959 makes me a Virgo where is Chris Hadfield right now on earth I'm in Las Vegas baby and what happens here falls on the floor where did Chris Hadfield go in space I went around and around and around the world we launched out of Florida we're actually on my third flight we launched out of Kazakhstan just south of Russia you go straight up for a while then the spaceship turns over start going faster and faster and faster parallel to the surface of the earth so that the whole trajectory of the spaceship is to go around the world and if you can get going seventeen and a half thousand miles an hour five miles a second 25 times the speed of sound then you'll stay in space basically forever you'll just coast once you get there so that's what I did gotten three different rocket ships blasted off went around the world two thousand six hundred and fifty times so I went on a pretty amazing world tour more than Keith Richards I think all right oops all right this one at risk of putting shadows on my face says when Chris Hadfield when when Chris Hadfield let's choose him verb here when did Chris Hadfield first walk in space I first walked in space during my second spaceflight we were on board space shuttle Endeavour we were building the International Space Station imagine you're wearing the most uncomfortable clothes you've ever worn like like a big snow suit or something end gloves and a hat and big boots you can hardly move you grab on to both sides of the hatch and you sort of like maybe a chick coming out of an egg you know you have to sort of fight your way out but then you pull yourself out and you're weightless let go with one hand and you float around gently the other way and suddenly you've gone from this claustrophobic little dark place to now being surrounded by eternity where the whole world is silent next to you like this big magic globe but it's separate from you but all around you is the three dimensions of of everything and it's perfectly black it's it's unbelievable like you've given birth to yourself into a whole new place if you get a chance go on a space walk when was Chris Hadfield last Space Flight seven years ago right now I was onboard the International Space Station it was 2012 2013 it was so cool cuz I was up for half a year so we went halfway across the solar system like we went from one side of the Sun to the other while I was on board the ship pretty neat watch the whole world like swap ends what was winter in the northern hemisphere became spring got to watch the snow and everything move and things start turning green the time I was up there okay when will when will Chris Hadfield while drum roll please get out of space I don't even know what that question means maybe people out there searching on Google maybe they think I'm still in space I'm still spaced out well I know I've been back for seven years and happily so there's no choices we're all in space all the time where would I go space is all around us why Chris Hadfield all right why is Chris Hadfield a hero he's not why is Chris Hadfield important to Canada I was the first doing several things I was the first Canadian to do a spacewalk I was the first Canadian to command a space ship I was the first one to use the big robot arm and if you're Canadian you're really paying attention you'll notice the name of the robot arm is the canid arm so there's this great big arm with Canadian flags on it out in space being operated by a Canadian with a Canadian flag on her shoulder for the first time big ridiculously Canadian moment so I think that's why I'm important to Canada white why did Chris Hadfield retire because I got a Holt look at my hair because I was never gonna fly in space again and once you've done all the things you should do an astronaut it's time to go do something else why is Chris Hadfield Space Oddity an odd phraseology but I get a version of David Bowie's classic tune Space Oddity which was a play on the word Space Odyssey and I played it on guitar and recorded on the space station and lots of people have seen it it's actually a really beautiful song and David Bowie loved my version of it which was a huge compliment he said really nice things which was great why is Chris Hadfield under the ocean this you may not know I lived at the bottom of the ocean for like two weeks because living at the bottom of the ocean inside a habitat it's sort of like living in space inside a habitat it's a good way to train for the technical stuff but also psychologically if you can't immediately come up to the surface if you have to solve all your problems yourself it's not a bad psychological training ground for being an astronaut so if you see Chris Hadfield under the ocean that's probably why what Chris Hadfield okay let's choose a word what is Chris Hadfield famous for I think I'm most famous for strangely enough playing music I mean I'm an astronaut I've done spacewalks I was NASA's director of operations in Russia I intercepted Soviet bombers off the coast of North America during the height of the Cold War but I think I'm most famous for playing guitar and singing Space Oddity in orbit I've made a lot of effort to communicate with people using social media during my third spaceflight I made a bunch of videos if I go into any school around the world they've been watching those videos sort of as as part of their science classes the ease of of Twitter and such allowed me to communicate with so many people around the world almost on a one-on-one basis what is Chris Hadfield favorite color blue sort of a sky blue it's a nice place to be color around my eyes what awards because chris hadfield one how about a lot of awards in grade 8 I won the public speaking contest in my school in grade five I won the posture contest I was also the top test pilot at the US Air Force test pilot school and top test pilot in the US Navy the award that actually meant the most to me was as I was a test pilot they did this really complicated test to put a hydrogen burning engine for a hypersonic airplane out on the wing tip of an f-18 and I presented at the Society for experimental test pilots big annual conference and I won best project for for being a test pilot for the whole world and that kind of opened the doors to get chosen as an astronaut your life sort of trundles long you'd hit a big watershed and after that everything after is sort of the result of one moment in time or that might have been the one I'm most proud of one that had the biggest impact on my life anyway what is Chris Hadfield it's a little tiny one what is Chris Hadfield Oh IQ I don't know but I actually when I was a teenager I was kind of you know insecure like everybody and I wanted to join Mensa the organization of people that were that had high enough IQs and it turns out when I did the Mensa test Mikey was high enough to join Mensa but then once I join Mensa I didn't really know what to do next but it at the time it seemed important all right what languages does Chris Hadfield speak I speak English and then I'm from Canada and so we teach French in Canada a donkey pollen food for a COC aid and then as an astronaut I wanted to be able to fly a Russian spaceship and work with Russians and so you never do Puerto sceetos yeah I speak a little bit of Russian a little bit of German but I've kind of forgotten all of it how to eat in space Chris Hadfield well your food floats for one thing so you don't need a plate like a plate would be useless so what you do is you get your package you either make it cold or hot and there's just like this little easy bake oven where you can warm up to package you can't really cook it might be dehydrated food and then you slide it over a needle and you dial and you push a button and it fills up the package the right amount of water now you've got your package and you mix it up and your velcro it to the wall let it sit soak up the water and then you carefully slid it open because if you open it quick you'll get like a little spooky stuff all over the room so you don't want that so you carefully open so nothing comes flying out because nothing's gonna fall to the floor and then you get a spoon spoon is a great utensil and you want a a long spoon so we can go all the way to the back of the package and then you eat everything out of one package you don't like have peas and meat and potatoes and corn you just eat all of your piece first and they have to be creamed piece they don't float all over and then you ball it up super tight because you have to get rid of your garbage put it in the garbage and then you open your next thing which might be I don't know or tortilla so that's how we eat in space one thing at a time in its package it's sort of like I don't know eaten on the bus or eating on a camping trip or something here's a funny thing about being in space and that is because there's no gravity that means that the stuff in your nose and your sinuses never drains so it's sort of like you always have a head cold you can't really taste your food as much you know in here like this your food all sort of tastes bland because you're not smelling it you're not getting it in through all of your sensors so food and space taste sort of bland and the food that has the strongest spice naturally in it is shrimp cocktail because we've got cocktail sauce on which is you know a lot of horseradish now you wouldn't think you would have shrimp cocktail in a spaceship filled with a nice red hot sauce on it you bite into it it's got that nice crunch and then you get that surge of eye watering horseradish cocktail sauce and for a moment or two it clears your sinuses so my favorite space food was shrimp cocktail how to sleep in space Chris Hadfield first you have to decide when right because you're going around the world sixteen times a day so when is it night it's night every you know 45 minutes of course you're gonna get a sunrise every 90 minutes so you have to cover all the windows so the Sun doesn't get in your eyes and then you float into your little sleep pod and there's a sleeping bag tied to the wall with a string you you float in carefully you float into your sleeping bag it's got arm holes and then you could zip up your sleeping bag and now you're just sort of loading like a fish in an aquarium inside your sleeping bag you pull the little doors closed on your sleep pod you turn the fan down as low as you can don't want to suffocate but make it quiet and then you shut off the light and then you relax every muscle in your body and your arms float up and your knees float in your butt waist bends and your head comes forward and your whole body's perfectly relaxed and you don't need a pillow and you never have to roll over your shoulder doesn't get sore it's like the most calm and comfortable sleep you've ever had in your life I think if we start flying tourists in space it's gonna be feel like the space spa the best sleep you've ever had how to meet Chris Hadfield hmm well let's see I speak all over the world I'm constantly traveling I've been millions of people I don't just hide so if you want to meet me you could go to my website Chris Hadfield CA I think and see when I'm gonna be somewhere or you can send me a note we could eat meat I'm on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and such you could write me a nice letter I'd love to get a letter from you and if you draw me a really nice picture I'll stick it up on my fridge how long was Chris Hadfield commander of the International Space Station about two or three months we take turns and we go up in a little spaceship or the Russian one the Soyuz pretty soon we'll be going up and down on American ships built by Boeing and built by SpaceX but when I went we took turns there were new crews every three months so if you think about it we rotate who's in charge every two or three months okay this is a big question at least you know physically how did Chris Hadfield contribute to space exploration well when you're the first to do things people notice because if say for example there'd never been a Canadian who was the mission specialist which was like a fully integrated crew member on the space shuttle I was the first Canadian so that was sort of a big contribution for the 37 million people that live in Canada did a bunch of research while I was up there I helped run the 200 experiments on the space station I helped build two space stations that's kind of a you know with your hands kind of contribution but I was NASA's director of operations in Russia so I helped helped the space program across cosmos of Russia and NASA of the United States work and get along so I contributed there and I served as an astronaut for 21 years every single day for 21 years so that was that was a big contribution as well this question is unnamed it just has my name I can open it from right to left just for variety okay the first Canadian in space and now we have to choose the modifier was ah was Chris I'd field the first Canadian in space no the first Canadian space was Marc Garneau the second was Roberta Bondar the third was Steve McLane I was fourth fourth Canadian in space very proud did Chris Hadfield walk on the moon I never got the chance and we haven't had anybody walk in the moon since I was 12 soon we will there are their astronauts training right now and and we're building hardware right now for people to not just walk in the moon but actually start settling the moon start living there just like we live in Antarctica or some of the more remote parts of the world so what's happening so maybe I'll still get a chance to do what I dreamed about when I was a little boy okay here's the next question go to space with who did who did Chris Hadfield go to space with I went to space with Russians and German and Americans I think but that's all just kind of arbitrary I went to space with people from Earth okay one more question here in the unnamed section and that is is Chris Hadfield okay yeah thanks for asking okay part of what happens in space though is a lot of things degrade in your body you lose part of your skeleton your muscles sort of waste away because there's no gravity that you have to fight so your body gets lazy your heart gets smaller your balance system gets confused because there's no gravity some astronauts in fact their eyeballs because of the change in the internal fluid pressures of your body their eyeballs change shape so they see not as well after they've been in space but I've been back from space six or seven years now and my bones are dense my muscles are strong my eyeballs are okay everything seems to be alright my balance systems good so yeah I'm okay Thanks so that's a lot of questions about me how about you have any questions about I don't know astronauts in general all right oh cool what astronaut here we go what are the requirements to be an astronaut that may be changing right now because with Elon Musk and Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos and and other companies trying to allow anybody who can buy a ticket to be an astronaut or at least to fly in space I think that'll be good but up until now you had to kind of really be ready to fly a spaceship so if you want to fly a spaceship what are the requirements well you need to understand complicated things like orbital mechanics how do you maneuver in space how do you how do you make things accurately work how does a spacesuit work or the physiology of the human body or a little understanding of solar physics and rocket propulsion systems and communication systems and being able to reprogram the computers and plus it's an International Space Station so learn to speak some other languages and so there's a lot of requirements but the fundamental three things you need are number one a healthy body that fits in your spacesuit so not too big not too small and healthy number two the proven ability to learn complicated stuff so how do you know somebody can learn complicated stuff choose people with multiple university degrees who've proven that they can get a high score on a test or do original research and then the third people who can make good decisions so we choose people who have had complicated jobs like test pilots and medical doctors life or death where people have run programs in my case to become an astronaut I didn't really know what to do I'm from a country that doesn't have very many astronauts but I looked at the astronauts of the world and the cosmonauts and I thought okay everybody needs a university education so I went to four different universities and I did it all in technical mechanical engineering and I thought okay I need I look at you know Neil and Buzz and Sally Ride and and everybody and they have good healthy bodies so okay I need to keep my body in shape so think about what I eat and exercise a little bit and keep myself strong and then I thought astronauts fly in space you know that's a verb I can learn to fly I just have to do it so I started learning to fly when I was a teen I joined the Air Cadets they taught me to fly gliders and then powered airplanes and then I joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and flew a bunch airplanes eventually flew fighters as I was a sea f-18 pilot and then I went to test pilot school but the US Air Force and then was a test pilot with the US Navy then Canada had an astronaut recruitment and they hired me to be an astronaut so so I guessed right I was a kid what is astronaut ice cream made of you've probably tried to ask for an ice cream it you bite into it and it sort of melts in your mouth and crumbles it's like a block of cotton candy I think ice cream Western and ice cream is mostly made of sugar like whipped sugar the secret is we don't actually eat astronaut ice cream in space it's not really astronaut ice cream it's Science Center ice cream because if you think about when you bite into that astronaut ice cream it makes crumbs because it's that hard brittle sugary stuff and those crumbs would go everywhere without gravity they they'd be in your eyes you breathe them they'd be in the filters so it would be bad space food what is astronaut centrifuge when you fly a rocket ship because it's accelerating through the atmosphere so hard with the big engines pushing you you could push back in your chair and you sort of get crushed by the force of this rocket F equals MA right force equals mass times acceleration we've got that big force and you're a mass so you're getting accelerated and you feel that acceleration is like multiples of your own weight and the big rocket motors can crush you in your chair with like four or five times your weight and when you come back into the atmosphere and we're letting the air slow us down you can get crushed like with eight times your weight which is really brutal but how do you get ready for that well what we do is we get in a little simulated spaceship and that's on the end of this huge arm and it spins us around and around and around until we're getting pinned against the outside of this little thing and then we have to operate the spaceship and show we can do what we're supposed to do this thing is called a centrifuge depending on on how you operate your capsule coming home if you mess it up and you're gonna pull a whole bunch of gee you're gonna crushed a lot and you have to wear the the result of your mistakes so it's a really good reinforcing place to Train what kind of music do astronauts like astronauts come from everywhere we like all the music there is we actually disagree about music on board this astronaut likes music that has a melody that stays in your head and words that mean something and there's lots of astronauts who are musicians we keep musical instruments up on the space station there's a guitar up there there's a ukulele there's a keyboard powered by batteries so when we're relaxing in the evening or when it's somebody's birthday or when it's a holiday then we get together with the instruments on board and and play music it's just like you do on earth the next questions are where we're asked you're not where I think it's gonna say do know where is where is astronaut training astronaut training for the United States is primarily at the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas are just outside of Houston and then in Russia it's at the Yuri Gagarin cosmonaut training center but then we also train in Canada at the Canadian Space Agency on the outskirts of Montreal and we train in Europe in Germany at the European astronaut Center which is just outside of Cologne Germany and then also in Japan because it's an International Space Station so everyone's got their own training and that one is in a little scientific training town called scuba all around the planet where astronauts feel the atmosphere begin that's cool you're floating weightless in space you turn your spaceship around backwards because you're going around the world in this perfect circle and you fire your big engine for like maybe four minutes and it changes you're perfectly circular orbit into kind of like an oval where there's a low part nano and a high part and that low part of your oval starts to just touch the top of the atmosphere like like if you stuck your hand out the window of the car not going too fast you can just feel a little bit of air pressure but you're going so fast where you're going five miles a second so even a tiny little bit of air really starts to slow you down and when you feel the top of the atmosphere the only way you can really feel it like is if you hold your checklist up and you let go of it and instead of just floating in front of you it now starts to gently fall towards the floor everything starts to behave like a feather and you're still kind of just hardly sitting in your seat that you're strapped into but with every passing second you start to see the effects of gravity more and more and we sort of really call atmospheric entry about four hundred thousand feet up we call that entry interface that's where you start to feel the atmosphere begin and if you look out the windows of the spaceship you can see that they're starting to get hot and as you come in it gets hotter and hotter and there's flames pouring all around until if you can imagine that you were somehow inside a blast furnace and the red and yellow flames are ripping all around your ship as that that huge deceleration is causing all the friction and pressure and drag that's that's what the atmosphere does to you a little later but the early wispy atmosphere 400,000 feet where astronauts hang out huh at the space bar yeah standard jokes well we have to live near our training equipment so most astronauts live close to the Yuri Gagarin cosmonaut training center in Star City Russia or the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas there's a few obvious favorite places nearby to those space centers where where we go in the evening there was one classic called the outpost which was close to the Johnson Space Center and it had all sorts of sort of contraband paraphernalia old astronaut pictures and sign pictures and stuff people had brought back from space and stuck to the wall in this crappy old firetrap of a building eventually the fire inspector said now we you know we need to be grown-up about this and the outpost got torn down but for a lot of years that's where the astronauts hung out at the outpost these next questions by popular demand started with why why astronauts never cry in space well it's not because we're not sad actually sometimes you cry because you're happy and what I found actually it's such a rich experience that my emotions were closer to the surface the whole time I found myself laughing and crying way more often than I do on earth but you can't really cry without gravity gravity pushes the weight of the tears down out of your eye well without gravity then the tears are not gonna get drain out of your eye in fact they're just gonna stay in your eye until you can't really see properly and then you need a hanky or something to dry your eyes now if you watch the movie gravity I think when when Sandra Bullock was crying somehow her tears were propelled across the spaceship her tears were squirting across the room I don't know anybody who cries like that in space tears don't fall why astronaut not use pencil in space that's not true we do we use pencils in space all the time pencils don't care where where gravity is you can write up you can write down you can write sideways so we use pencils all the time we use grease pencils because grease pencils are really tough we use sharpies sharpies work great ballpoint pens don't work too well because you know take a pen and write upside down for a while if your pen won't write upside down like a lot of them do then it's not going to be a good pen to use in a place where there's no gravity I don't have a Sharpie but if I did I would cross oh not why astronaut use pencil in space a little bit of a caveman phrasing but we use pencil in space because pencil work all right why do astronauts exercise in space being in space is the ultimate lazy existence it's the ultimate place for a couch potato you don't have to fight gravity you don't have to lift a finger you don't have to hold your head up everything just floats nothing sags it's a great place to be but as a result of the fact that you don't have to fight gravity you can be super lazy even your heart gets lazy because it it doesn't need to lift the blood from the bottom of your feet all the way up to the top of your head it just has to push it through your blood vessels your heart actually gets smaller your muscles would waste away you wouldn't have this big skeleton fighting gravity so your skeleton would dissolve so we have to exercise in space because we're coming home again and we don't want to come back as like you know jellyfish so we exercise about two hours a day on the spaceship we have a stationary bicycle no seat because you don't need a seat it's more like I don't know a unicycle without a seat and then we have a treadmill that we can run on and there are big elastics that we wear on our hips and our shoulders to hold us down on the treadmill so we can run and pound away and then we have a resistive machine you can't lift weights because you're weightless so between the treadmill and the bicycle and the reason system exercise 2 hours a day you want to be conscious of your own sweat when you're weightless and so what we do is we keep a towel nearby and if you're good you can take the towel and just float it there in space next you and you workout for a while until you get in the sweaty and then you dry the sweat off and so your towel becomes sort of disgusting after a while and then you just velcro the towel to the wall and the sweat evaporates out of it it becomes humidity inside the spaceship that's collected in the dehumidifier and it's turned back into drinking water and getting onboard your sweat becomes becomes what you drink the next day yes long as you have a good purifier it works all right I came home the same weight is what I launched but with 20% less fat so 20% more muscle so it was good came back kind of ripped it was ok and my cardiovascular was good but I didn't keep the bone density up the bone density and my hips and my upper femur had I lost about eight and a half percent of my bone which is a lot and so you running a big risk of breaking your hip when you get back until your body goes whoa I'm back on earth and starts to build dense bones again why do astronauts go to the moon well so far only 12 astronauts have walked on the moon 24 astronauts have gone to the moon a lot of them just orbited it they didn't walk it's not like a lot of astronauts have kinds of the moon but why do astronauts go to the moon we went because in May of 1961 President John F Kennedy stood up and said we choose to go to the moon that's why we went it was a form of cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union it was proof that we could it was to challenge the the whole industrial capability of the United States like why climb Everest challenge yourself see if he can do it make it part of who you are but now that we've done it why go back to the moon I think now it's just like all exploration first prove that you can do it and then make it part of the experience eventually we'll go to the moon to stay and live just like everywhere else why do astronauts train underwater how do you simulate being weightless I mean sitting here in this chair I'm being crushed down all the time so it's a lousy simulation of weightlessness now we could all ride in the back of an airplane and have the airplane push over and have us all sort of float for a second in the back or if you got the airplane going like this if you could float for maybe 20 or 30 seconds and we do that because it's it's good for little short experiments but if you really want to Train like for a an eight hour spacewalk you can't do it in little 20-second segments so we decided a long time ago let's let's train underwater and we'll use the buoyancy of the water and then the weight of the suit to balance out and then it's sort of like being weightless it's not of course because if you go upside down in the water the blood still rushes to your head and you have the drag of the water moving through the water is way different than moving through the emptiness of space it's it's like you imagine how big a normal Olympic swimming pool is and then make it 45 feet deep that's what the space station swimming pool training pool is like we call it the neutral buoyancy laboratory all right how how astronaut how many astronauts have walked on the moon well it started with a Neil and Buzz it ended with Harrison Schmitt and jeans sermon Cernan so that's four and there were eight others in between Apollo 11 12 not 13 because they had problems in the weight of the moon 14 15 16 and 17 so 12 human beings have walked in the middle brave guys how astronaut communicate in space we talked to each other on board the spaceship and people are from all over the world so you have to choose a common language the majority of the International Space Station was built by english-speaking people and russian-speaking people so on board we speak primarily English but lots of Russian to sort of in a mixture of both is su",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h as yoga voodoo Petroski but the Muslim will in the keep our genus Dancy so I had to learn to speak Russian because I was a member of a crew onboard the space station and the cosmonauts equivalently learned to speak English but that's just amongst ourselves we have to talk to earth so here's what you do you grab the microphone in the space station or you push a little transmit button on the wall and your voice goes through the air to a little microphone on the wall the microphone turns into an electric signal that then goes through the wires to a little digital thing that turns it into a digital signal and then that goes outside of the ship to a big antenna and we send it up to a geostationary satellite twenty you know two thousand miles away from the earth and it collects that signal from us and then redirects it down to a great big dish antenna somewhere on the planet like the ones in in New Mexico and then they collect that little digital faint signal and then they take that digital signal to send it through wires across the United States and it gets to the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas where there's another little machine that takes a digital signal and turns it back into sort of a analog signal and then it comes through a wire up to a little speaker that shakes the same way that microphone did on the space station and moves the air molecules and they come across and goes to someone here and they hear you how long that takes depends on how far away we are sometimes we're on the other side of the world radio waves go basically at the speed of light 186,000 miles a second but that's still you know 186,000 miles it is the world is 25,000 miles around so if you got to go all the way out to 22,"000 and back again and maybe even twice it can take a second or two so when I phoned my wife from the Space Station it would go through all of those links and then get you know through the Houston telephone system and it would ring on her phone but the delay was so long that she'd pick it up and she'd go hello and I go hello but by the time she said hello and it got to me and I said hello back to her it might be three seconds and she always thought it was like a sales call and she'd hang up on me so she actually got the numbers from NASA so that instead of it coming up as some unknown number it would say space so her phone would say space Oh space is calling and then she'd wait for me to answer the next question is how astronaut come back to earth when you say how do you get back to Earth your real question is how do you slow down you don't want to hit the world at seventeen and a half thousand miles an hour we don't have enough fuel to just like fire our rocket and slow down we couldn't bring that much fuel with us so we just used Frick we use the drag of the air to slow us down we just start to fall into the atmosphere and then once we're in the atmosphere it catches us and then we fly the spaceship as carefully as we can to not have too much drag or too much heat big s turns all the way down to let ourselves get aligned and then when we get close to the earth if your spaceship has wings like the space shuttle then you can land it on a runway but if your spaceship is just a little capsule like a gumdrop then it would just suck into the world so we have a great big parachute or maybe two or three parachutes and then you can land in the water which isn't too hard you've done a belly-flop water can be hard but waters a little more forgiving than dirt or rock so you can land your spaceship in the water and then run the risk of it sinking or you can have it land on land and if you're going to land on land you can use airbags on the bottom and that's what Boeing is doing now or you can have little Rockets that just before you hit the ground they go perfect and fire so that it slows you down just before you hit the ground and that's what we did in my third spaceflight and the Soyuz has little little retro rockets to cushion you or as the Russian let's call them soft landing rockets it's like Greenland or the Cape of Good Hope you don't believe the you know the sales pitch it's a pretty rough landing all right last questions how do astronauts poop I don't think you're asking how we poop I think it's how we use the toilet we poop like everybody okay I'm gonna get graphic here for a second how do you know when you have to poop on earth it's actually because of the weight of the poop inside you tells you hey it's time to poop you know how sometimes you're lying in bed and you're okay poetry to stand-up you go wow I really got a poop well if you're weightless and your body's not gonna tell you it's time to poop so you almost have to learn this new sort of fullness symptom that tells you it's time to poop you're counting on gravity because gravity is going to pull it away from you and without gravity even when you're done pooping the there's the poops just going to stay sort of sticking to you so we wear a rubber glove and sometimes you have to like physically separate the poop from your body but then taking the place of gravity to pull the poop down into the toilet is airflow we have air pulled down into the toilets got fans in it so and that works for the P as well so when you want to poop on the space station then you you wait till it's your turn in the toilet because there's a limited number of toilets on a spaceship two four six people go into the toilet it's look we have it's sort of like a little closed off area take your pants off completely because you don't want them floating around when you're on the toilet and then you sit on the toilet and it's got you could either hook your toes under some toe loops so that you don't float off the toilet or on the Space Shuttle we had sort of like a little seatbelt thing that claimed like imagine wearing a seatbelt so you don't float off your toilet but you don't want to float off the toilet partway through it be a mess then you turn the toilet on great loudest thing on the spaceship because of all those big fans to pull the air down into the toilet and then you pee and poop just like you do everywhere and the pee goes down into a sewage system that has purifiers and filters and gets turned back into drinking water again just like on earth except it's not quite as personal on earth and then your poop though goes down and gets pulled inside a tank it looks like a big milk bottle on the space station when you're done we use wet wipes because you don't have a sewage system so you don't have to use toilet paper get yourself nice and clean everything goes in there and then it goes down inside the toilet and then you clean up for the next person you put the lid on the toilet and when the milk-can is completely full of poop then we seal it with these great big knurled knob dogs on the top so that none of the smell will come out then we store it down in sort of a cold storage area in this station and then when one of the unmanned ships comes up with all the food and supplies and scientific equipment and then we fill it with all of our garbage including our solid waste or our poop and we seal that up and then when it undocks it separates from the station and and we fire it down into the atmosphere and then it it burns up in the atmosphere so the next time you wish on a shooting star think about maybe what you're looking at I'm Chris ad field thank you for being part of my wired autocomplete exercise I hope you learned a few things about spaceflight and maybe a little bit about Chris Hadfield

WIRED",WIRED,gGaxo98yHuI,"[""greetings greetings bill nighy here today we're going to do some science support our first question comes from Destiny Dolan no serious question what makes people think global warming isn't a real thing like it's February and at 70 degrees outside upside down smiley emoji so I'm thinking now that it's cognitive dissonance this is a real effect where people have a certain worldview they're confronted with evidence which conflicts with the worldview so they have dissonance conflict in their minds what's generally done instead of changing your worldview which you may have held your entire life you dismiss the evidence and along with that you dismiss the authorities that may have provided the evidence bird TV asks if we can clone extinct species should we I think it'd be cool what we're all talking about is like a woolly mammoth hi Steve all right bill it's my woolly mammoth impression this one would be named Steve anyway I think it'd be cool but it's not up to me carry on do you know how long Earth has existed this is from ISA Nissan and I would say yeah 4.6 billion years rocky on line I have a doubt related to evolution theory if we evolved from monkeys then why are there still monkeys haha that's brilliant you're the first guy to ever wonder this we did not descend from monkeys monkeys and we have a common ancestor so you may have seen this picture this famous arrangement this isn't really accurate it wasn't just one to the other to the other as we say the the family tree of hominids like you and me and even my old boss haha it's not just a straight line of one organism leading to another it's a bush as we say so there's many many branches and you and I ended up on one of them and so we did not descend for monkeys monkeys and us have a common ancestor and you can prove it Anthony Arjun Arjun Arjun asks what makes a planet a planet you gotta have enough gravity to be a ball and right now you got to have enough influence to clear out your orbit from stuff other debris stand with Rand rights can alternative energy effectively replace fossil fuels absolutely yes burning coal is the worst thing we can be doing so I encourage you to check out the solutions project.org they have done an analysis of not only the United States as electricity needs but 130 other countries around the world and we could power the whole place right now if we just decided to do it with wind solar energy some tidal energy some geothermal energy we could run the whole place wouldn't shut down existing nuclear plants but it's really hard to build a new nuclear plant because nobody wants them around running to asks a double rainbow I saw a couple months ago what causes double rainbow opposed to a normal rainbow well one could make an argument a sense there's always a double rainbow it's just the second one is much fainter it doesn't it's not as bright so the background has to be the sky has to be dark enough for you to see it generally our camp asked why is this guy glue why can't it be green careful what you wish for air molecules are spaced in such a way that when waves of light pass between them they are scattered as we increase the greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere people have speculated that the scattering will change the molecules that are doing the scattering will be so abundant that the sky will no longer be blue it's not good carry on our camp vexy drawing magnets how do they work their magic no what happens in certain materials the strongest one most common one the one we all know and love is iron and these are steel and steel is almost entirely iron just a little bit of carbon there's what they call a virtual current where the electric electrons are moving from atom to atom and this produces this magnetic field and this tendency is so strong that magnets stay magnetic for centuries chocolate chip asked what is the fourth dimension is it smell fourth dimension is time this is not rocket surgery fourth dimension is time X Y Z time lil poundcake asks can artificial intelligence take over the earth yes yes what do you think no people make artificial intelligence are we gonna make a machine that produces electricity in a way that we can't control that takes over for us really who is gonna build that machine how long do you genuinely believe the human race is existed on earth about a hundred thousand years Jerry buck what is dark matter it's not clear but it has apparently an influence like gravity and there's more of it than there is regular matter that you and I are familiar with Gerogia person people say that cell phones I think it's might give off radiation to the brain turns out people get brain tumors all the time people talk on cell phone way way more of the time they have done studies trying to connect cell phones and brain tumors there is no connection carry on farad OMSI how safe is acupuncture I knew people believed in acupuncture there's no value to it but if you think it works and it makes you feel better carry on will horseradish and rib O's you leak through you when you after you get acupuncture I don't know run a test try it Brianna Rey they say avocados are good fat but how much avocado can you eat before it becomes bad fat you can eat a million avocados what do you think for crying out loud there's calories and avocados just there's also some unsaturated fat avocados are great I recommend an avocado with a poached egg that is that's living mates I wonder what the world would be like after a nuclear war it would suck okay I was in class when professor Carl Sagan talked about this idea of nuclear winter where you'd set off so many nuclear weapons so rapidly all the debris thrown in the sky would make the earth cold and this was

162,1,Inside the Boeing 737 MAX Scandal That Rocked Aviation | WSJ,Boeing’s two 737 MAX 8 crashes and the investigation that followed ruined not just the aircraft manufacturer’s reputation but also its bottom line. WSJ’s aviation reporters break down how the scandal unfolded and explain what the flying public can expect in the future. Photo: Gary He/EPA-EFEMore from the Wall Street Journal:Visit WSJ.com: http://www.wsj.comVisit the WSJ Video Center: https://wsj.com/videoOn Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/wsj/videos/On Twitter: https://twitter.com/WSJOn Snapchat: https://on.wsj.com/2ratjSM#WSJ #Boeing #737MAX,Wall Street Journal,0jTN0JD4I5M,"['(dramatic music) - The Boeing saga this past year is an example of how\nnot to handle a crisis. - A relatively small design issue that exploded into massive catastrophe. - They did not build in\nmargin for human error. - This brand new plane crashed twice in the span of about five months. How could this possibly happen? - How long has this plane\ngoing to be grounded? Boeing says there\'s a fix. When is it coming? - Boeing was once held up\nto be the gold standard of engineering excellence. And today it has lost\na lot of credibility. - The 737 MAX scandal will\nchange aviation history like no other event in the\npast five or six decades. - [Narrator] Until relatively recently, Boeing\'s reputation among\npilots and passengers was second to none. Today, that faith has\nbeen significantly shaken as America\'s aviation\ngiant continues to reel from the fall out of\ntwo devastating crashes that killed 346 people. The MAX crisis has severely crippled the nation\'s biggest exporter. Exposed critical flaws in the relationship between the FAA and the\nbusinesses it regulates. And raised serious questions,\nhow was this able to happen? Who is to blame, and what does this mean for the future of the aviation industry? (dramatic music) In late 2018, things were\ngoing pretty well for Boeing. - Before the first crash,\nBoeing thought of the MAX as a cash cow that\nwould keep on producing. - They were just breaking\nall sorts of records for revenue and airplane deliveries. - [Narrator] A global boom in air travel had helped the company\nearn record profits, which drove it\'s stock\nprice to new heights. - Problem prior to the crash for Boeing was that Boeing couldn\'t\nmake the MAX fast enough. We wrote about how Boeing was running out of\nparking spots for the MAX. - [Narrator] The MAX\nis the latest iteration of Boeing\'s 737 aircraft, which first entered\ncommercial service in 1968. - It\'s kind of the work\nhorse of Boeing\'s fleet if you\'ve kind of done any\nkind of medium length travel, domestically, you\'ve almost\ndefinitely flown on a 737. - [Narrator] As times\nchanged so did the 737. Over the years, Boeing has\nupdated the jet dozens of times. All the while maintaining\nthe original air frame. And this system worked well for Boeing. The 737 is the most successful commercial airplane ever made. In 2017, 50 years after\nthe first 737 took off, Boeing was following a\nlong established play book when it delivered one of\nthe first 737 MAX eight\'s to a budget Indonesian\nairline called Lion Air. - [Newsreader] An\nIndonesia passenger plane crashing into the sea\nminutes after take off. - [Newsreader] 189 people on board. - [Narrator] On October 29th, 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX eight jet\ncrashed into the Java sea, killing everyone on board. - There are a bunch of questions\nthat immediately come up. A brand new plane went\ninto commercial service about a year before it crashed. That\'s unusual. What could have happened? Could there have been pilot error? Was there a maintenance issue? - [Narrator] Some of the\nmost important reporting to come out after the crash was the story about an\nobscure piece of software. - We were obviously trying\nto understand things about this airplane and the\nsystems on the airplane, and so I went to a\naviation safety conference. One of the people we talked to was a pretty senior Boeing executive, and he acknowledged that\nthey never told pilots about the system. And essentially what\'s the big deal. - [Narrator] Boeing at the time argued that pilots didn\'t need to know about the existence of the\nautomated flight control system, who\'s name the public would\neventually learn was MCAS. - Well how can that be? How can there be something on a plane, not only that pilots\ndidn\'t fully understand and weren\'t trained on, but also just didn\'t know that it existed. - After the first crash I think\nwe still didn\'t yet realize how big the story would become. (mellow music) - [Narrator] The origin of the MAX scandal has it\'s roots in the rivalry\nbetween Airbus and Boeing. Ever since the 1990\'s the two companies have\nbeen locked in competition. By the 2010\'s the\ncommercial aviation market was essentially a stable duopoly, with each company controlling\nroughly half of the market. At the heart of this rivalry has long been each company\'s flagship commercial passenger plane. For Boeing, that aircraft is the 737, for Airbus, it\'s the A320. (dramatic music) In 2010, Airbus shook up the market when it announced the A320 Neo, an updated version of\nthe A320 aircraft line. Neo planes wouldn\'t\njust be updated versions of a familiar aircraft, they\nwould also be cheaper to run. - Fuel efficiency\'s the\ntouchstone of anything that airlines do. I mean, if you talk about bean\ncounters and penny pinchers, airlines are the ultimate in those areas. - [Narrator] It\'s time to think max. - Boeing did not design\na completely new plane from the ground up because\nit would have taken too long. - [Narrator] To make the MAX, Boeing took the existing 737 air frame and paired it with a new,\nmore powerful engine. But doing that changed\nthe plane\'s aerodynamics. One effect was that in\nrare flying conditions the aircraft\'s nose would pitch up. This is where the MCAS software came in. It was designed to automatically\npush the plane\'s nose down. - One former Boeing engineer\nwho didn\'t work on the MAX, characterized the software\nfix as a band aid. We\'ve been learning for the last year how the band aid wasn\'t as\nstrong as Boeing needed it to be. (slow piano music) - [Narrator] On March\n10th 2019, a second crash. This time in Ethiopia. All 157 people on board were killed. - [Male] I heard about the second crash. - When on Sunday morning. - I woke up and kind of rolled\nover and looked at my phone. - I got a text from an airline official, and it simply read, ""MAX eight"". I thought, how could this be, another one? - From the moment that\nthe second crash happened, we\'ve really thought or written\nabout almost nothing else. - Plane crashes in\ngeneral are pretty rare. Plane crash within five\nmonths of each other, is pretty stunning. (dramatic music) - This is unparalleled in\nmodern commercial aviation. It doesn\'t happen. - [Narrator] A day after the crash, in an unprecedented move,\nChina grounded the MAX. Other nations quickly followed. - China grounding the planes before the FAA had done\nthat was a huge deal, and it came as a huge\nsurprise to all of us. - Historically speaking,\nthe FAA has always been the, the leader that all the\nother countries followed. - [Narrator] This was the\nfirst time in aviation history that any nation\'s regulatory\nbody had overruled the FAA. - An emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights\nof the 737 MAX eight. - [Narrator] Two days\nlater, the FAA relented and decided to ground the MAX. This marked the beginning\nof the agency\'s troubles, as the MAX crisis brought the regulator under increased scrutiny. In April, Boeing began to face\nthe financial consequences of the scandal. News then emerged that Boeing\nhadn\'t informed the FAA the warning system that\nhelped pilots diagnose an MCAS malfunction wasn\'t\nworking as intended. Boeing\'s lack of transparency about MCAS was highlighted yet again when a recording emerged of a meeting. - [Michael] If you\'re\ngonna give us a system that we are gonna be affected by, it\'s hugely important that\nwe get briefed on what it is. - [Narrator] The story was\nbased partially on a recording made about a month after the first crash, when a group of Boeing executives met with the American\nAirlines pilot union. In the tape, the pilots\nconfront the executives, saying they were not told\nenough about the plane. - [Michael] Most people say, ""If it ain\'t Boeing, it ain\'t goin\'."" That\'s where most of us get that from because we think we\'ve\nbeen dealt with honestly by the company. We\'re getting told via the news media that you know what, the average pilot, that\'s a little bit too much information for him to understand and\nbe able to comprehend. - [Narrator] Then in July it was revealed that after the first crash, the FAA had done it\'s own\ninternal risk analysis of a potential second crash. - Their analysis showed that if the FAA and Boeing didn\'t do anything and just kept the planes\noperating as they had been, there would be 15 crashes\nover some two decades. That would make the 737 MAX\nthe most dangerous jet airliner ever developed in the modern world. - What was going on inside Boeing? What was going on inside FAA? Did anyone discuss grounding the plane after the first crash? - A lot of questions have been raised about what the FAA\'s role was. Whether the agency was\nreally doing it\'s job in overseeing the design\nand production of the MAX. You know, the FAA\ndelegates Boeing employees to do some of that oversight itself, and I think some people\nhave questioned whether that has gone too far. You know, whether it\'s sort of the fox guarding the hen house. (mellow music) - We set out to pin point the root cause of how Boeing created\na plane that crashes. We really tried to get to the heart of how they came to these decisions. - Why didn\'t they use two sensors? They only used one sensor and that is sort of a\nviolation of basic engineering. - At the root of it Boeing made an incredibly\nflawed assumption. - But they failed to recognize badly, that all these other emergency\nsignals would be confusing. Would make it very very\ndifficult for a crew to do the right thing\nin a fast enough way. - [Narrator] Despite the intense scrutiny surrounding the MAX, at that time Boeing wasn\'t\nespecially forthcoming with information about the plane. - I spent much of the summer\nknocking a lot of doors in the Seattle area, trying\nto find Boeing and FAA people who would help us understand\nhow all this happened. People would politely\nsay no, close the door, sometimes it was more of a\ndoor being slammed in our face. - We went to, I think it was\nsomething like 200 houses, you know, drove 500 miles. It was really difficult to get people to agree to talk with us. - [Narrator] That fall,\nBoeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg appeared before congress, where he was sharply\ncriticized by senators. - How did you not, in February, set out a nine alarm fire to say, we need to figure out\nexactly what happened. - We\'re not quite sure\nwhat Mr Faulkner meant by that exchange. - I think it was widely thought that he did not perform\nwell in those hearings. - He survived two days of\nreally tough questioning, but he was brutally wounded. - In conjunction with those hearings he sat down with family members\nin a closed door meeting, and they sat there with large posters with photos of their loved ones. In one case, a family\nmember brought photos just of the coffins of his\nwife and his mother in law, and his three children, and he lost and he told the Boeing officials, including Dennis Muilenburg, that he didn\'t feel they deserved to see his family members\' faces. In December, the company finally said, we can\'t keep making these planes, we\'re going to have to\nshut down our factory. And that has a huge ripple effect throughout the supply chain, and I think, all of the relatively rosy projections that Dennis Muilenburg had been\nmaking throughout the year, finally it came to a head, and the board said enough is enough. - [Narrator] Less than a month\nlater, Muilenburg was fired. - It wasn\'t surprising when\nMuilenburg was pushed out, it was more surprising\nthat it took the board as long as it did to push Muilenburg out. - He wasn\'t visible. You know a question that came up a lot was ""Where is Dennis?"" - [Narrator] In the new year, Boeing has continued to\ngrapple with the fall out from the MAX scandal. The end of which doesn\'t\nseem to be anywhere in sight. On January 10th, Boeing released a batch of\ninternal communications. - They showed Boeing employees talking about tricking regulators and say some really unflattering things about the regulators that\nthey were dealing with. - It gives you a real glimpse\ninto culture inside Boeing. - [Narrator] It was\nthese internal messages that likely led to\nBoeing\'s hand being forced to reverse their long held stance that pilots didn\'t need\nsimulator training. - That is a stunning development. - We had been writing about\nhow going back nearly a decade, Boeing had designed the MAX from the start to not require additional\nsimulator training for pilots. - [Narrator] Flight simulators are highly specialized machines, built to train pilots on the ground. One of the MAX\'s biggest selling points, touted by Boeing from the beginning, was that the pilots who\nknew earlier 737 models, like the 737 NG, wouldn\'t need much more\ntraining to pilot the MAX. For years, Boeing assured\npilots, airlines and regulators that pilots who knew the\nNG could easily fly the MAX after just a few hours\nof training on an iPad. - Requiring pilots to go\nthrough simulator training before flying the MAX\nsort of raises questions about the fundamental, you know, value proposition of the MAX. You know, what is the value of the MAX? - [Narrator] Since March 8th of 2019, Boeing\'s market value has\ndropped close to $112 billion. - There is an ongoing\ncriminal investigation by the justice department. There is a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is also the subject of inquiries by the congressional law makers. It is also being looked at by the Department of\nTransportation and the FAA. The plane is still on the ground. Perhaps most important\nof all, 346 people died. - The MAX saga shows\nthat there\'s something that needs to be reassessed\nin that whole system. It\'s time to take a breath. And let\'s think about the\ndown sides of automation. How it can confuse pilots, how it can introduce\nunexpected consequences and new hazards. So we\'re looking at a new world where other regulators\nwill be much more assertive and will take a much greater\nrole in approving aircraft, even if they\'re US aircraft. - [Narrator] In an email\nto the Wall Street Journal, Boeing said, ""The development\nto the MCAS portion ""of the software is complete, ""however the entire software package ""is going through the\nsystem safety analysis, ""and then will be presented\nto the FAA for approval."" Boeing said it expects\nthe MAX to be cleared to back in the air this summer.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jim elantris from Empire State College to my immediate left Michael Dowling who needs no introduction in this facility but Michael Dowling worked for 12 years with Governor Mario Cuomo who I believe was the best governor to serve in the history of the state of New York I may not be objective on that 12 years with Mario Cuomo was a long 12 years when you worked with my father those were dog years when you worked with Mario Cuomo so 12 years Michael basically ran the health care system for the state of New York and developed the health care system during that time then went now runs northwell health system which is the largest hospital system health system in the state and he's been extraordinarily helpful here in dealing with this virus and he's going to be even more helpful as we go forward so it's a pleasure to be with him to my right Melissa the rosa secretary to the governor and to her right dr. howard Zucker will you all know who's our commissioner of health who's been doing a great job pleasure to be here today this is one of the most challenging times that this state has faced in modern history challenging time all across the nation a lot of questions a lot of anxiety a lot of opinions out there everybody has an opinion everybody has a watch the news talk to people everyone has an opinion on what we should be doing everyone has thoughts that they want to share one of the things that makes me frustrating for my team as I say that's I'm interested in your opinion I'm interested in your thoughts but let's start with facts first right and then once we agree on facts then we can get to opinions and thoughts and beliefs but let's start with fat and that's what I've been doing for the people of the state of New York let me give you facts our total hospitalization rate is down again you see this curve we talked about it on the way up which was a painful journey we talked about it at the quote-unquote apex which turned into more of a plateau of flattening and now we're seeing it gradually decline we would have liked to see a steeper faster decline but this is where we are and it's a painfully slow decline but it's better than the the numbers going the other way you see it on total hospitalizations you see it on intubations and you see it also in the number of new cases per day this is important because while we're seeing that hospitalization rate go down and you see the number of new cases going down those number of new cases are still problematic right so it means 600 new cases yesterday with everything we've done we still have 600 new cases yesterday either walking in the door to hospitals or people who are in hospitals who were then diagnosed with Kovac but that number is also going down one of the most stubborn situations and the most distressing or the number of deaths and that is down from where we were but it's still 232 yesterday which is an unimaginable and painful reality that we have to deal with and when people talk about how good things are going and the decline and the progress that's all true it's also true that 232 people were lost yesterday and that's 232 families that are suffering today also a caution in the number of deaths I know the reporters and everyone likes to trace these numbers and document these numbers I think we're going to find when all is said and done that the numbers are much different than we actually thought they were the amount of information that is now coming out that changes what we believed or what we were told happens almost on a daily basis this was a virus virus that started in China now last week the CDC says oh it didn't come from China it actually came from Europe to the East Coast that's how it got to New York and that's how it got to Chicago etc that by the time we turned off travel from China the China travel ban the virus was already gone and it was in Europe and then it came here from Europe and we didn't know at the time so February March flights were landing people coming from Italy from the UK etc they were bringing the virus we didn't know they're now saying that the virus may not have come just in February March the virus may have come late last year they're doing testing in Chicago now on people who passed last November in December to see if they passed from the kovat virus so I think this is all going to change over time so a note of caution and I think it's going to be worse when the final numbers are tallied we're also not fully documented all the at-home deaths that may be attributable to coal pit so I think that the reality is going to be actually worse but there's no doubt it's a time of unprecedented anxiety stress people want answers people want answers now haven't had a paycheck they don't know where their job is they don't know if they're going back to work where they're going back to work when they're going back to work and they want answers now and I understand that fully but before we look for answers let's make sure we're all understanding the same question right and the question here is not do we open or reopen the society when do we reopen and we have to reopen the society you asking when do you start breathing you have to right the economy must function people need incomes the economy has to work state needs revenues people have to be able to live their lives you have to be able to get out of the house you have to be able to see friends you have to be able to see family so it's not a question of do we reopen it's a question of how we reopen that's really the question that we have to grapple with and that we're dealing with in New York our position in New York is the answer to the question how do we reopen is by following facts and data as opposed to emotion and politics right everyone has emotion I want to go back to work today I'm gonna go see my family today I want to be able to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks and socialize with my friends today I do by the way but it's not about emotion it's not about political position on reopening there's a Democratic position Republican position this virus kills them across Republicans there's no politics to this deal with facts and deal with data and use that to instruct you even more important at a time of high emotion understand the emotion appreciate the emotion but deal on the facts and the data and you have it you can calibrate by the number of hospitalizations the infection rate the number of deaths the percentage of hospital capacity the percentage that you're finding an antibody test the percentage of finding on diagnostic tests positive negative you're collecting tracing data make your decisions based on the information and the data that's what we're saying in New York that that actually works and by the way we know it works when you look there's a chart today that was published by the New York Times you look at what's happening in New York yes our our line is going down our number of cases is going down we have turned the corner and we're on the decline you take New York out of the national numbers the numbers for the rest of the nation are going up they are going up to me that vindicates what we're doing here in New York which says follow the science follow the data put the politics aside and the emotion aside what we're doing here shows results the hospitalization rate is down the number of deaths is down and the number of new cases is down for me I've been focusing on this number of new cases that's where our health professionals are focused why because with everything we've done close schools close businesses everybody shelter at home all the precautions about wear a mask wear gloves etc you still have 600 new cases that walked in the door yesterday week before that we still saw 1,000 new cases every day where are those new cases still coming from because we've done everything we can to close down how are you still generating 600 new cases every day where are they coming from again let's look at the facts let's look at the data let's understand and see what we can do so what we've done over the past few days is we ask hospitals look at just those new cases who are coming in right yesterday 600 new cases where are those people coming from and what can we learn from those people to further target and refine our strategy when you look at where they're coming from they're primarily coming from downstate New York which is not surprising basically equally distributed Long Island is is 18 percent so that's a number that jumps out at you Rockland and Westchester which is where we did have a problem that's down to 11 percent when you look at the racial breakdown of who's getting hospitalized you see it's disproportionately minorities disproportionately African American and Latino again in downstate New York higher percentage male 52-48 we don't know exactly why but the virus doesn't discriminate generally and a very high percentage comorbidities which is what we've been talking about in which we understand which is not a surprise this is a surprise overwhelmingly the people were at home where there's been a lot of speculation about this a lot of people again had opinions a lot of people have been arguing where they come from and wherever we should be focusing but if you notice 18 percent of the people came from nursing homes less than 1% came from jail or prison two percent came from the homeless population two percent from other congregate facilities but 66 percent of the people were at home which is shocking to us disproportionately older but by the way older starts at 51 years old I'm a little sensitive on this point but if older starts at 51 years old then that's a large number of us old folk in this in this state in in this country so that whole vulnerable population being old well old is now 51 and up so think about that sixty to seventy twenty percent seventy to eighty nineteen percent but fifty-one years old is old okay and I am very old transportation method we thought maybe they were taking public transportation and we've taken special precautions on public transportation but actually no because these people were literally at home 2% of car services 9% were driving their own vehicle only 4% were taking public transportation 2% were walking eighty four percent were at home literally were they working no they were retired or they were unemployed only 17% working so that says they're not working they're not traveling the predominantly downstate predominantly minority predominantly older predominantly non-essential employees and that's important we were thinking that maybe we were going to fire find a higher percentage of essential employees who were getting sick because they were going to work that these may be nurses doctors transit workers that's not the case and they were predominantly at home so now that's only three days that's just about a hundred hospitals 1,000 people but it reinforces what we've been saying which is much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself everything is closed down government has done everything it could Society has done everything it could now it's up to you are you wearing the mask are you doing the hand sanitizer if you have younger people who are visiting you and may be out there and maybe less diligent with the social distancing are you staying away from older people over there starting at 51 by the way and but it comes down to personal behavior this is not a group that we can target with this information it's really about personal behavior another issue that we're looking at and we're trying to understand and what is happening in these hotspot clusters that you see popping up you see it happening across the country in meat plants where you have a significant number of people getting infected and there's now a meat shortage in the nation well we have a hot spot in New York State we have a hot spot in upstate New York Madison all night at counties and it's around an agricultural business but it's not a meat processing plant it's actually a greenhouse farm and we have dozens of cases coming from the employees in this situation so what does that tell you well it's not really about meat or vegetables right there's nothing about the fact that it was a meat processing plant because we have a vegetable processing plant it is about worker density and large gatherings that's the caution flag here that's an the message it's not about poultry it's not about me it's not about vegetables it's when you run a facility with a large number of workers in a dense environment and we learn that already in New York when we had the New Rochelle hot spot which was the first hot spot in the nation New Rochelle Westchester and the lesson was one or two people infected who go to a large gathering or a dense gathering that virus just takes off on you and we learned that in New Rochelle they're learning it again in meat processing plants and poultry processing plants across the nation and we just went through it again in and we're going through it now and Madison and Oneida County so that's something that we have to watch and keep in mind also at the same time that we're going through this reopening exercise I want to make sure we don't miss the opportunity in the moment and the opportunity in the moment is that we went all through this let's learn the lessons and let's take this moment in history to actually improve from where we are and to build back better I want to set the bar high and set the goal of not just replacing what we did okay everybody go back to where we were I don't want to say that we spent all this time all this pain all this suffering lost all these deaths only we'll go back to where we were go back to a better place how do you take how do you find the silver lining in this viral storm and actually improve your situation we're on Long Island we were through superstorm sandy was horrendous thousands of people displaced but we learned and we built back better Long Island is better for having gone through Hurricane sandy well how can you say that because it's a fact we learned we improved from a horrendous situation well how do we do that here and that's part of what we want to do you know people talk about making changes in society change is very hard to make change is hard in your own personal life right how many New Year's resolutions did we make as a society that are still in effect here in May right I was supposed to lose five pounds I was supposed to be running every day I was supposed to never lose my temper forget it one week maybe ten days for the temper the but history does show that people are ready for change at certain moments and I believe this is one of those moments like the superstorm sandy like a 911 like we've seen after natural disasters around the country where people say I get it and I'm ready to make changes and that's what we want to do and that's what we talk about when we say look it's not just about reopening it's about rebuilding it's literally about reimagining and moving the state forward at this moment and we want to do that how do we come up with a better transportation system how do we have more social equity in society a better safety system better housing better economy better education better health care system and we need the best minds available to take this moment to put together with the best thinking that we can find to make the best improvement one of the lessons is in public health and our hospital system we worked in an impossible situation when this started we were told that we may need 130,000 hospital beds for kovat that was the initial projections we only have 50,000 hospital beds in the state how do you get 50,000 hospital beds to a 130,000 capacity it was impossible and by the way we don't really have a public health system we have separate hospitals all across the state but they don't really function as one system they never really work together on a day to day basis they don't share patient load they don't share PPE how do you do that and we scrambled and we made it work but now how do we institutionalize that and how are we ready for the next Co vid or the next whatever it is how do we use telemedicine better how do we better you allocate our health resources how do we harden the healthcare system but let's take the lessons we just learned and institutionalize it and we've asked Michael Dowling to do that he was a big part of the scramble that we went through to make it work and northwell was a leader it's the largest and in my opinion the most innovative but now how do we take that and institutionalize it so we don't have to go through this again so next time something like this happens we can just open a book and it says here's what we do step a step B step C and we want to thank Michael for his service with that and he'll be working with dr. Zucker from the Department of Health another area is education we went to remote learning overnight that's what happens when you close the schools okay all the students go home we're gonna go to remote learning well what is remote learning and we weren't really ready for it we had all talked about it thought about it there was some but we were not really prepared to do it we then had to do it we implemented it and God bless the teachers in this state they did a phenomenal job and God bless parents who had to figure out quickly how to use computers and technology and zoom this and zoom that but how do we really learn those lessons and we went to Bill Gates and he's gonna work with us on reimagining the education system and I want to thank him very much how do you create a testing and tracing system by the way what is a testing and tracing system right we never did this before well we have to take thousands of kovat tests antibody tests diagnose diagnostic test and then we have to trace have an army of tracers to do this we're doing it for the first time ever but how do we learn and institutionalize it yes we have to do this for Kovac but we're not going to go through all of this trouble and then just forget it this will happen again some people say this virus comes back in the fall or the winter or there'll be another health emergency but Michael Bloomberg has generously said that he would work with us and use his philanthropy to develop that testing and tracing and then on a larger scale how do we really use new technology in the economy of tomorrow and that's the lesson that we're all learning right work from home telemedicine tellin it's all about technology and a better use of technology and really incorporating the lessons into that and the probably the best mind in this country if not in this on the globe to do this is I believe a true visionary especially in the field of technology and that's Eric Schmidt who was former CEO of Google obviously and just saw a future that no one else envisioned and then developed a way to get there and we've asked him to come work with us to bring that kind of visionary aspect to government and society let's look at what we just went through let's anticipate a future through that lens and tell us how we can incorporate these lessons and mr. Schmidt who has tremendous demands on his talent and his time has agreed to help us and had an effort to do this Eric thank you so much for doing this and thank you so much for being with us well thank you Thank You governor you have been doing an incredible job for our state and frankly for the nation and I'm really pleased to help the first priorities of what we're trying to do are focus on telehealth remote learning and broadband we can take this terrible disaster and accelerate all of those in ways that will make things much much better the solutions that we have to come up with have to help the people most in need people are in different situations throughout the state we need to consider all of them and not take one or the other so the intent is to be very inclusive and make this thing better we need to look for solutions that can be presented now and accelerated and use technology to make things better my own view is that these moments are a chance to revisit things that are not getting enough attention and we have systems that need to be updating and need to be reviewed my commitment is to make this period of this sort of awful period to be a period as you described in Long Island where New York State New York City everyone comes out stronger the public-private partnerships that are possible with the intelligence of the New Yorkers is extraordinary it needs to be unleashed you are the person to help us do that we are already where we're all in we are New Yorkers so we're aggressive about it and we're ambitious about it and I think we get it Eric you know we went through this period and we realized that change is not only imminent but it can actually be a friend I've done the right way and I hope that when we look back on this time we talk about all the pain or the suffering but we also say it was a moment in time where we came together and we brought a creative aspect and an innovative aspect and we work together in ways we never did before and we made this place a better place and I can't thank you enough for doing it Eric thank you very much I look forward to continuing the conversation and working together mr. Schmidt thank you yes thank you God thank you that is exciting last point today is National Nurses Day as you know nobody knows better than New Yorkers how our nurses really stepped up with our health care professionals you know when the pressure is on in our lives you wind up seeing the best and the worst in people and heroes rise to the occasion and that's what we saw in the state of New York our frontline health care workers were just extraordinary showing up every day working impossible hours virus that nobody understood fear of infection but they just kept rising to the horizon to the occasion and that's why New York and the nation just loves all our health care workers but our nurses especially have done a phenomenal job and we thank them from the bottom of our hearts and JetBlue had a beautiful idea of a way to say thank you which is donating round-trip flights to 100,000 medical personnel and nurses to honor their efforts isn't that a beautiful thing 10,000 to New York medical professionals Michael darling doesn't is not eligible for that situation but other than that because we need him here in New York but it's a nice way that JetBlue is saying thank you and all of us will find our own way to say thank you but I'm sure every New Yorker joins me in saying thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of our heart and to all the nurses who are here today god bless you and thank you for getting us through this and thank you for being New York tough which is not just tough but smart and disciplined and unified and loving god bless you questions yes about reopening so along the way you've rubber-stamp some things that you could say make common sense like golf courses you know you were asked about drive-in theaters you said hey that might be a good idea so if a business owner right now says I have a super creative way to do this I can do it immediately and be safe you talk about smart New Yorkers intelligent Yorkers do you trust that and you move forward with other things yeah piecemeal yeah we have we have a very detailed reopening plan with very detailed steps I touch on it in what we just talked about we look at different regions in this state because there are different situations in different regions right New York City is different along that's different than the Adirondacks is different than Buffalo New York and the numbers are just dramatically different the way we talk about in this nation states are in different places in this state regions are in different places that's how big this stadium is how diverse it is so there are specific factual data points that each region has to assess our is your infection rate going up or is it going down or your hospitalizations going up or your your hospitalizations going down do you have healthcare capacity if god forbid that infection rate takes off on you do you have the hospital capacity to deal with that do you have the ICU beds to deal with it you have the PPE if yes to those questions then in that region working with the local officials what businesses do we reopen and the analysis there is businesses that are most essential and pose the lowest risk should go first construction jobs because construction jobs especially exterior construction jobs workers are basically socially distanced by the nature of the work and can wear masks getting their construction industry up and running again manufacturing in a manufacturing setting where you can do social distancing right the meet plants are a caution flag the poultry plants are a caution flag the agriculture farm upstate is a caution flag not manufacturing where you have density and people three feet from each other on a factory line because that's a problem but manufacturing where you can socially distance and then you can even go business by business drive-in theater where an employer says this is how I'm going to operate it everybody stays in the car nobody gets out of a car you can make those decisions of both stores you can say maybe a laundromat know is that we get to that point and we have the steps where you go through the data because first of all you want to make sure you have the you want to make sure you have the virus on the treat right you want to make sure you're not still seeing that virus like fire through dry grass and we do have the virus on retreat all across the state different levels of retreat in different parts of the state but it is on retreat in all parts of this state which is dramatically different than the numbers for the nation which is worth noting you have states that are opening where you still are in the incline I think that's a mistake do you think by cutting the Advantage program you bear some responsibility for New York City's spike homeless increased funding for homeless all across the board local governments then decide what the best programs are for that locality it's different or not so different of Suffolk different in New York City but we've increased funding dramatically exponentially and so it's not just a question of funding it's how you use that funding and I've worked on the homeless issue since I was in my 20s first I render not-for-profit I was the largest not-for-profit provider for homeless families in the United States then I went the federal government I worked on homeless programs all across the country I've been in more homeless shelters homeless programs and probably any other elected official so it's it's not just money it's you have to know what you're doing and you have to have a program that makes sense you'll what are you doing to make sure that healthy boards of elections are able to handle what will likely be a very large influx of absentee ballots and protect poll workers who still must be there look the best we can do you still have to run elections the court said we have to run elections I don't think it's a good idea to have people go standing on line to vote you shouldn't say to a person if you want to exercise your civic duty you have to endanger your public health and possibly endanger others we've seen video of other elections held across the country we have people waiting on line six feet apart to vote I mean that that made no sense to me so to the extent we can do absentee ballots and make that available to everyone and mail them out to everyone and make that easy I think that is the best way if we have to also have an election day where people show up on Election Day my two cents to people is please vote by absentee ballots so you don't have to show up but then if they have to show up they have to socially distance etcetera are you doing anything to make sure that the boards of Elections around the state are able to handle what you are asking them to yeah well we're working with all the local boards of Elections I've not heard from any Board of Election that says they can't send out the ballots we told them last week they have to will send out pre-stamped forms that people can just send right back and I haven't heard any issues from any local boards of Elections have you heard we're working closely with the local County Board of Elections as well as the heads of the Democratic and Republican Party to make sure everyone has confidence in how the elections are being held there's a very real possibility that certain elections won't be called on election night that is a reality people should prepare for because as you said the hope is the majority of the people are going to be mailing and their absentee ballot and so we want to make sure that the counting process is done right and it's thorough and that people continue to have confidence in faith and democracy and so that may mean that certain elections are called a couple of days afterwards to make sure the counts are done properly in terms of helping to support the county boards of Elections one of the things we've discussed internally if it's something that they need is supplementing with the National Guard and seeing if the National Guard can step in and help where we know that they met that there may be issues but it is something that we're focused on in continuing to talk to the county you're not beyond my paygrade on information so I'm going to refer the question to dr. circle but just for what I know and what I believe I said the originally we were told the virus came from China right and everything was stopped the virus from China and China travel ban CDC comes out last week and says oh no it didn't come from China it came it went from China to Europe and then from Europe to New York which is a dramatically different situation because we were sitting here in New York February March watching China and the federal government came in and they were all our airports screaming everybody from China nobody screamed people coming from Europe and now it turns out there were like two million people who came from Europe during that time and they landed at JFK they landed it in the werk Airport someone to Chicago that's where the flights go and then they just mixed into society and then you have New York which is one of the most dense communities in the country and the virus took off nobody said it was coming from Europe right we people visitors from Europe work walked right through the airport nobody said two New Yorkers be careful if you just with somebody who came from Italy be careful they may have the virus nobody said that so it was totally new I can't speak to the East Coast strain versus the West Coast reign on the antibodies that was an initial thought that if you had gotten the virus and you had the antibodies that you would be immune to another infection I think that's now being questioned but again you're beyond my paygrade Thank You governor so what the CDC is doing and and others are looking at is the genetic fingerprinting of this virus to try to figure out the differences between whether it's those came from China and from Italy and unfortunately all the information is not out yet about how this has whether it's mutated what's the difference of these viruses and the severity of the virus as to whether a one strain would be worse than another regarding the antibody issue as the government said initially the feeling was that one has anti-bias they should be protected but we continue to learn more about this virus every day and there are little things we're going to learn more about is the protection from when you have antibodies and what that means and also for how long that protection would last if one is protected from that so it is a great question and it's hard to give you an answer at this point right now because there's still more research to do today - someone from Illinois did they think the virus may have come last December or November so they're looking at autopsy reports to see if it should have been a cause of death last year which to me is just a wake-up call that you know we think we know what we know but nobody knows nobody knows I mean look at all the revisions that are now going on about all the facts that we thought we knew January during march the elder named Milan does not seem close to meeting all the necessary criteria even lagging behind the city on one key data poin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" why is that and along with that the contact tracing seems to be a big challenge and yesterday the Nassau County Executive said that there's going to be this software for the contact tracing system isn't gonna be online for four weeks what role does that play in in reopening yeah the one of the new systems that we have to develop here is everybody talks about test trace isolate we have to do thousands of tests by the way we've already done 1 million tests in this state this state is brought testing online faster than any state in the country and we now do more tests per capita than any country on the globe in New York so we've been very aggressive and successful at bringing testing online but we have to have testing in every region Long Island New York City upstate different regions upstate and then an army of tracers you're talking about thousands of tracers who take every positive call up every positive who did you go to dinner with who did you whatever and then isolate those people and you have that facilities to isolate people who can't be isolated some people can't be isolated at home so that has to be in place in every region we are working with regions to get that up and running but you have to have you have to have the virus on the decline and then you have to have a way to monitor that virus and that's testing and tracing I don't know about the counties software system I don't know if Jim knows we spoke I spoke to the county executive last night and that is one issue that we're working with the county on is the testing and tracing the other piece that I think you refer to as the gross hospitalizations new people coming in the door which is a sort of concern of new infections the data that the governor mentioned today where are people coming from what are their demographic information who are they will help ice delete and target better for people in regions to say here's a hotspot zone to get that infection rate down so this will help long island in other regions target better where the infections are coming from to lower that overall infection rate which will help in the reopening process as we go forward and that's what Michael Bloomberg is helping us with putting together this tracing testing program again it's never been done before on this scale we have to do it now and then we actually want to keep it institutionalized because I don't believe this is the last time that we're going to go through this I think this is part of the overall new normal you know we're seeing storms we never saw before we've seen changes in the environment changes in weather patterns and I think this is going to be it's the first real public health emergency that we've had on this scale but I would not believe that this is the last time we go through it so I think learn the lessons and institutional distance not in this city because we're on Long Island here but in these let's call it in this city in this city when you're on Long Island this city is New York City although there are many cities in the state the social distancing is important the enforcement of social distancing and wearing a mask is left up to the local governments and the local governments have discretion and how to enforce it and obviously it should be enforced in a non-discriminatory non-selective way but I think it's important that it is important that people socially distance it's not I think I know it's important that people socially distance I know it's important that people wear a mask I know masks are now even believed to be more important by health care experts than the initially were that they can be more effective and it is so easy relatively in the scope of things to wear the mask I mean look we're at north well look at what the people here at north well just went through for the past two months to save lives and we're asking people wear a mask so you don't spread the infection compared to what people have gone through they don't want to wear a mask no that's not who we are it's not what we are we're part of a society we understand we're responsible one for another wear the mask I don't even have a good looking mask and I wear it I have this very plain boring white ugly mask but with this face it doesn't make a difference thank you very much

Tom Frieden president and CEO of resolve to save lives and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the CDC from 2009 through 2016 and dr. Caitlin rivers senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health security an assistant professor in the department of environmental health in engineering at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health dr. Frieden and his testimony will provide a perspective based on 30 years of fighting epidemics including leading the CDC's response to Ebola of where we are and what we need to do to protect Americans dr. rivers makes the case why in the months and years to come will we need additional capacities in diagnostic testing contact tracing and the health systems to combat the virus I'm also so glad to have my colleagues here I want to thank them for being here this morning on the Democratic side congresswoman Katherine Clark Cheri Bustos bonnie watson coleman and on the Republican side Congressman Tom Cole congressman andy Harris and I hope we will have congresswoman Jaime Herrera Butler we are all disappointed that others could not be here because of distance reduced flights and the health issues raised by the House physician chairwoman Nita Lowey ranking member Kay Granger congresswoman Lucille roybal-allard Barbara Lee Lois Frankel and congressman congressman mark Pocan John Molenaar and Tom graves they could not attend but they did send questions which we will ask on their behalf but I want to underscore that members should not be blocked from participating in the committee's hearings all committee members should be heard and that requires moving as quickly as possible into the 21st century and conduct virtual hearings every member should be able to participate I am angry that the White House mismanaged America's reaction to the pandemic and the president has done everything he could to avoid accountability I'm particularly upset about the lack of the necessary testing and the personal protective equipment capacity both of which could help us to gain control and then yesterday President Donald Trump told reporters that he would not permit dr. Anthony Fauci to testify before the Democratic House committee because in that quote the house is a bunch of Trump haters quote they frankly want our situation to be unsuccessful but they are allowing dr. Fowler to testify before the US Senate next week this is a bipartisan panel dr. Fauci has appeared before our subcommittee dozens of times he has testified whether it was a democratic or a Republican chair he has testified hundreds of times on Capitol Hill working with Democratic and Republican presidents yet now the White House said no maybe no doubt it he's just frightened of oversight the labor HHS subcommittee provided billions of dollars of funding for the CDC the NIH the National strategic stockpile hospitals and Barda we have appropriated 175 billion dollars for hospitals and other health care providers most recently twenty five billion dollars to expand testing and improve Diagnostics including 11 billion dollars for state and locality testing capacity the purpose of today's hearing is to get a clear-eyed view of the path forward for respondents to covet 19 in the near term as we work to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in the medium turn as we develop the therapeutics to treat the disease in a vaccine to inoculate millions of Americans against the corona virus and in the long term as we make investments to enhance our nation's public health and global health systems to better prepare for the next pandemic over the horizon these are the three pillars we will look to build in today's hearing I would like to explore the recommendations of our true public health experts on the necessary measures that must be put in place and the benchmarks that must be met to move forward while keeping Americans safe science and facts must drive our policy and that demands hearing from doctors scientists researchers and experts who command those facts and drive science to public policy it is urgent that we do so disease modelers predicted according to the New York Times and The Washington Post that in the coming months 3,000 Americans could die every day there is no time to delay our witnesses today will give us the analysis the facts the science and the strategy that will help us to make the right decisions with that I would like to recognize my good friend the ranking member of the committee for any opening remarks that he would like to make thank you madam chair and I make a few extemporaneous remarks before I get to my prepared remarks first I just want to really thank you for holding this hearing I think it's a very important hearing to to have and I want to thank all my colleagues that were able to make the trip here we all understand why others couldn't but I really appreciate each of you on both sides of the aisle for for coming and I want the record to show I joined the chairman urging that dr. Fauci be allowed to testify here I think it would have been good testimony useful to this committee I think useful to this country frankly I think going forward this subcommittee probably more than any other is going need administration employed expert input as we make the important decisions in front of us and while I'm not naive enough to believe that there's not a certain amount of partisanship on Capitol Hill and some communities are more partisan than others frankly the Appropriations Committee in general and particularly this subcommittee are not hyper partisan committees in my view and the record chosen in the last five years working together on this subcommittee and with our friends in the United States Senate particularly senator blunt senator Murray you know we've increased NIH funding by 39 percent we've increased CDC funding by 24 percent we've increased the strategic stockpile funding by 34 percent we've established the infectious disease Rapid Response Fund I think that's a bipartisan record of accomplishment to be proud of and I don't think in retrospect we've all wish we had done more but the reality is we are so much better off where we're at because of the actions taken in the bipartisan sense by this committee so it's record shows that it knows how to work together I just note for the record my friend the chairman when I was chairman that voted for final passage of the bill every single time we negotiated got to a place where you could agree and she helped me get it across I was able to do the same thing with her when she was last year assumed the chairmanship and I hope that's the way we can continue to work going forward so again I think we're going to be called upon to make some really important decisions and having read the testimony both dr. rivers and dr. Frieden you know a lot of that is going to call for sustained investment in the public health sector frankly I think it's going to call for us looking at the caps agreements on some of these accounts as well I don't think you can probably get to where we need to go within a cap so we need the the input which I know our two witnesses here today will will give us and again I look forward to working with every member of this committee in particularly with you madam chair I'd say arrive at the right decisions for all our country going forward so without again I want to thank you too for the any calls and briefings that you've held over the past few weeks to keep all of us updated on efforts to overcome this pandemic over the last several weeks the spread of Kovan 19 has caused unthinkable disruptions to life as usual and it will continue to do so for some time even as we flatten the curve following the unprecedented strain on our healthcare systems and the devastating economic hits to hardworking Americans as a direct result of this coronavirus desire for normalcy to return is certainly a sentiment shared by us all but a state and local economy slowly and cautiously began to reopen it's important to remember that getting back to business does not yet mean getting back to normal even though the fight against Kovan 19 is far from over keeping businesses closed and workers at home it's not a sustainable option for the long term while the federal government has provided some short-term relief to help individuals households businesses and communities stay afloat during this period of extreme social distancing our economies need to get moving again and Americans need to get back to work however any such efforts to reopen must continue to keep the health and safety of Americans at the top of mind and not undo previous progress in slowing the spread of coronavirus this will indeed be a balancing act until there are working treatments effective therapeutics and ultimately a vaccine to control Co with 19 the risk and the danger for disease remains returning to more regular functions and operations requires gradual action completed in phases and based on data President Trump and the coronavirus Task Force recently recommended criteria for states and communities to achieve before moving into phases of reopening this includes a consistent downward trends and reported symptoms consistent downward trend and documented cases or positive tests as well as hospitals being able to treat all patients without crisis care and robust testing in place for all at risk health care workers while this is a helpful reopening group blueprint states are not strictly bound to it indeed just as there are 50 separate and unique states there may be well 50 different approaches to reopening they carry the same spirit of caution and decision-making based on sound data however the idea behind these three phases is to gradually allow businesses and workplaces to open back up but not immediately at full speed ahead or without adaptations to prevent crowded environments in the earliest phases this may include limiting the number of employees inside of workplaces continuing telework practices vulnerable and other older Americans remaining at home or limiting the number of customers inside retail stores and restaurants clearly life is going to be different going forward for a while and it wasn't our immediate past regardless of the phase of reopening in our communities we must remember not to abandon practical and hygienic precautions like thoroughly infrequently washing hands not touching our faces daily disinfecting of surfaces keeping a safe distance from others and staying at home when you're sick finally it's critically important that the federal government learns from this crisis and actively prepares to face down another pandemic in the future well I'm proud that Congress has generously invested in worthy tools and response resources to strengthen our readiness in recent years it must be an even higher priority in the days to come though the United States was as prepared as any country to face the emergency you can never be fully prepared for what you don't know is coming in this case a mysterious and deadly virus originating in China only identified early this year and for which a vaccine does not yet exist I look forward to hearing more recommendations from our witness madam chair this morning and I yield back the balance of my time let me say thank you to the ranking member and assure you that we will continue as a subcommittee to work together in a collaborative spirit to do what's right in this area and in other areas that we have jurisdiction over on behalf of the American people and let me also welcome our colleague congresswoman Jamie Herrera Butler you've come a long way a state that has really been hard hit by the coronavirus so thank you so much for being here really appreciate that and and now I would like to introduce our witnesses our first witnesses witness is dr. Tom Frieden dr. Frieden is president and CEO of resolve to save lives a global initiative and part of the global public health organization vital strategies dr. Frieden was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the CDC from 2009 through 2016 dr. Frieden is recognized as one of the world's leading experts his current organization is assisting more than 60 countries during this covert 19 epidemic as well as providing technical assistance to New York State and other jurisdictions here at home during his time at CDC many will recall that he led the response to the Ebola outbreak along with his colleagues at the State Department he also spearheaded many new health initiatives here in the US including initiatives to address the opioid epidemic and to reduce chronic disease dr. Frieden we are so pleased to have you here today your full written test statement will be entered into the record and you are now recognized for your opening remarks thank you very much and good morning chairwoman DeLauro ranking member Coll distinguished members of the subcommittee I appreciate the opportunity to testify in the next few minutes as you say I'll provide a perspective based on three decades of fighting infectious diseases in the US and globally the bottom line is that kovat is a terrible tragedy families have experienced devastating loss parents have lost their jobs and all of our lives have been disrupted our war against kovat will be long and difficult and we must act strategically now and establish a new way of preventing future health disasters at an appropriate time we can assess what went well and what didn't I'm acutely aware that hindsight is 20/20 it's far too easy to second-guess decisions that others have made we're just at the beginning of this pandemic and must focus on the future there was only one enemy here a dangerous microbe it's us against them humans against the virus we'll get through this best if we work together learn from each other and support each other here are 10 plain truth is about kovat 19 first it's really bad in New York City where I live I've heard for the past two months the sounds of ambulances day and night in New York City it's on the order of the 1918-1919 pandemic more than 20,000 people when you look at all of the excess deaths in the last two months killed in less than two months that is as bad as the worst phase of the pandemic 100 years ago even now with deaths decreasing substantially there are twice as many deaths from kovat in New York City as there are on a usual day from all other causes combined and sadly looking at the u.s. as a whole just calculating forward from the number of people whose infections have already been documented there will be tragically at least 100,000 deaths from kovat by the end of this month second as bad as this has been it's just the beginning until we have an effective vaccine and unless something very unexpected happens our viral enemy will be with us for many months and possibly many years third data is a very powerful weapon against this virus real-time monitoring of trends finding cases before they become clusters clusters before they become outbreaks outbreaks before they become explosive epidemics that risk the lives of health care workers and others fourth we'll be able to reopen as soon and safely as possible by basing decisions on data and creating together a new normal we're also impatient to restart our activities sheltering in place is a blunt but effective weapon it suppresses spread of the virus but inflicts severe economic hardship on individuals and the economy we need to deploy all of the effective weapons in our Arsenal after flattening the curve the next step is what we call the box it in strategy there are four corners to each of the box and in aspects testing widely and strategically isolating people who test positive using contact tracing to confidentially warn people who were exposed to the virus and quarantine in contacts providing essential services so that they can be sure that infection stops with them if any corner of that box is weak the virus can escape and spread explosively again each of the four is important fifth find the balance between restarting our economy and letting the virus run rampant we're conditioned to think in terms of dichotomies a versus B but in this case open versus closed is not a dichotomy it's more accurate to think of a dimmer switch or a dimmer dial than an on/off switch with gradations to avoid undue risk even when we're closed many essential activities continue and when we reopen our new normal will be different with care and creativity we can open sooner and safer our new normal will change the way we travel work learn and go about our lives the virus can create a new generation in minutes but in human populations it takes weeks to see the result of return repeated spread so if as we reopen there's a lot of spread it will take weeks before we actually see it another false dichotomy is between public health and economic security in fact the very best way to get our economy back is to control the virus and economic stability is critically important to the public's health sixth we must protect the health care workers and other essential staff who are the frontline heroes of this war they should never have to put their lives at risk to care for us having safe for health care facilities is essential to enabling more societal activity to resume it's one thing to take risks for yourself but if the risk that you take for yourself ends up infecting a nurse or doctor and then their mother or father or child that's something quite different vii we have to protect our most vulnerable people unless we take urgent action there will be at least 100,000 deaths in nursing homes throughout this country all congregate facilities and high-risk high-risk settings require intensive protection we must also act now to reduce the higher rates of both infection and death among african-american Native American and Hispanic people viii governments and private companies must join forces to make massive continued investments in testing and distributing a vaccine as soon as possible ensuring rapid and equitable access in this country and around the world nothing else will enable life to get back to a pre kovat normalcy treatments can help and should be available sooner but are unlikely to be the kind of game-changer that a safe and effective vaccine would be ninth we must heighten not neglect our focus on non kovat health issues this is a very important lesson from around the world not only do underlying conditions increase the risk of severe illness from Kovan but if we don't continue non-covered conditions there will be many deaths that could have been avoided not from people infected with kovat but from people affected by the disruption and services that kovat causes and when fall comes around we'll need to do the best we've ever done at getting people vaccinated against influenza because that will make our job easier in the next phase tenth never again it is inevitable that there will be future outbreaks it's not inevitable that we will continue to be so underprepared this is an interconnected world a disease risk anywhere is a disease risk everywhere and when the world is safer we will be safer it was very difficult as you all know to secure funding for global health security it took years of effort and funding was only allocated after the Ebola epidemic hit and that only one-time funding therefore Congress and the administration deserve congratulations for quickly passing comprehensive bipartisan legislation for supplemental funding for the kovat response but supplemental funding is a temporary fix it's a band-aid without sustained support our health will be avoid ibly at-risk one-time funds are very problematic from the point of view of something someone running an agency you can't hire the best staff you can't enter into partnership with countries and organizations where you can keep up your end of the bargain and you can't hold contractors accountable for an ongoing contract you in Congress have a unique opportunity to take strategic action and protect Americans from another microbial sneak attack to protect us from health threats we have to change the way we allocate funds we've all been through this discretionary funding is subject to caps and sequestration even mandatory funding doesn't ensure stable support as we've seen we propose a new approach for specific public health programs these are programs particularly to prevent detect and respond to health threats and we suggest calling this to health defense operations or HD Oh was a budget designation it would exempt only these critical health protection funds from Budget Control Act caps so our public health agencies can protect us hgo programs should be required to submit a bypass professional judgment directly to Congress annually just as the NIH does for HIV Alzheimer's and cancer that way Congress and the American people can understand what's really needed for our public health defense and Congress can appropriate the resources required to sustain the public health system we need to keep us safe this investment can save millions of lives and potentially as we've seen trillions of dollars good public health is good business in my 30 years in global public health I've never seen anything like this it's scary it's unprecedented we're learning more each day I've outlined some of the things that we can do at home in business in government right now to slow the spread of kovat and rebuild our economy we must make sure this never happens again by investing in systems to find and stop emerging health threats before they spread whenever and wherever that's possible thank you and I look forward to answering your questions thank you very much dr. Frieden and appreciative I I think so personally about this this issue I never know him but my grandfather died in the Spanish influenza 1918 at age 36 leaving a widow and five children and one on the way and so it really brings it all home that we could be now experiencing this and our families could be experiencing all of this now I'd like to introduce our second witness dr. Caitlin rivers dr. rivers is a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins center for health security as well as assistant professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health dr. rivers has been a leading public health voice during the response to covert 19 she co-authored a report along with dr. Scott Gottlieb and their colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute AEI a roadmap to reopening which outlines a series of milestones and capabilities that states should meet as they consider easing restrictions on businesses and social life dr. rivers is also the lead author of a report public health principles for a phased reopening during kovat 19 guidance for governors which is being used by the National Governors Association as well as Maryland and Washington DC to guide their reopening plans I would also note that dr. Rivers worked as an epidemiologist for the United States Army Public Health Center as a department of defense smart scholar dr. rivers we are so pleased to have you with us here today again your full written statement will be entered into the record you will now are recognized for your opening remarks Thank You Jerome and DeLauro ranking member Cole and distinguished members of the committee thank you for the chance to speak with you today about the coab in nineteen response as chairwoman DeLauro described I'm an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health security at the Bloomberg Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health I've co-authored a number of reports and guidance documents on reopening safely and it's lessons from that work that I want to share with you today but first a little bit about the COPE the current situation the United States still faces 25 to 30,000 new cases every day and approximately 2,000 deaths a range that held steady for the entire month of April many states are either moving towards reopening or looking ahead to those decisions and wondering as we all are how to do that safely it's clear to me that we are in a critical moment of this fight we risk complacency and accepting the preventable deaths of 2,000 Americans each day we risk complacency and accepting that our health care workers do not have what they need to do their job safely and we risk complacency and recognizing that without continued vigilance we will again create the conditions that led to us being the worst affected country in the world and so with that in mind I want to highlight a few critical capacities that I think we should be prioritizing the first critical capacity is diagnostic testing last week we performed about 1.6 million tests which is a big improvement over March and even over early April when we performed about 1 million tests per week these gains are a testament to the impressive biomedical enterprise that we have built through sustained investment in science and medicine but estimates of the number of tests that we will need to gain control of this outbreak start at 3.5 million per week and go up from there we urgently need a national plan for how we will close that gap we need to understand what national capacities we can expect at the end of may at the end of June at the end of August where the bottlenecks where are the untapped resources and it's not just for the test kits it's also for all of those consumable supplies that are required for testing the swabs the PPE for the care providers the viral transport media there are a lot of components involved in diagnostic testing and at various points all of those have been located in intermittent shortages and we urgently need to understand where we are going with diagnostic testing and how we are going to get there if this work has been done I have not seen it and I fear that neither have the governor's and the mayors and the business leaders and the university presidents and the school principals all of whom are having to make decisions about how and when to reopen so it's not just the federal government that needs this information it's really all of us who are trying to navigate how we will get from where we are to where we want to be the second capacity is contact tracing you heard from dr. Frieden that contact tracing is really a key component a key approach that will allow us to reopen safely one thing that I don't hear a lot about about contact tracing though that I want to bring to your attention is that it's also a key source of data that we badly need we currently have very little understanding about where people are getting infected our most new cases in long-term care facilities or correctional facilities which we know are high-risk settings but we don't have a good sense of whether 99% of our cases originate in those special settings or whether it's a small fraction we don't know whether people who are essential workers still performing duties in the community are getting infected or we don't know whether most infections are happening at home getting a better understanding of what that looks like will help us to guide better interventions if it is special settings we know we need to be doing more to protect people there but we might also assess the risk to the general community to be lower on the other hand if most people are getting infected at home that points for a need for some sort of central isolation capacity by which I mean if people feel that they would be safer recovering in a hotel away from their families for example that should be an option that should be made available to them but we would want to know what fraction of cases are originating in the household to understand whether that is an important investment this information on where transmission is occurring is of critical importance but it's not currently being prioritized and it is contact tracing that allows us to collect this data so in addition to being a key tool for containment it's also a key tool for helping us to guide our response and the decisions that we need for that the third pillar is health care capacity we were able to secure enough healthcare capacity to treat everyone with kovat only through extraordinary measures like canceling an elective procedures and turning operating rooms into ICUs but right as we start to think about unwinding some of those decisions is when states are moving to reopen and so we need to be exquisitely careful in this period that we do not allow our health care systems to become overwhelmed by drawing down our search capacity as we increase time spent in the community we need to be careful that we do not again create the conditions of New York or Lombardi or Wuhan we should plan now for how we will staff and fund deployables EEMs to move from hot spot to hot spot and I'll point out too that we are making these decisions as we face hurricane season which will draw on many of the same resources and so I think we need to be planned for the worst case scenario and understand that we we may be needing these surge capacity resources in the coming months and we should also continue to fight for sufficient supplies for personal protective equipment to keep our health care workers safe this has been a continuous problem and it's one we need to solve permanently it's not acceptable that our health care workers don't have what they need to do their job safely so these three capacities testing contact tracing and health care will enable us to transition safely from staying at home to slow the spread into a gradual reopening we should be working now to ensure that we have the tools to do that successfully I now want to touch briefly on a longer-term priority that I think we should keep in our sights we've seen on the White House Task Force briefings and on the nightly news that infectious disease modeling or outbreak science is playing an important role in guiding the köppen 19 response and it's not just CO vid this was also an important capacity during 2014 Ebola during h1n1 and it will certainly be an important resource in the future pandemics that we can be confident we will face but what many people don't realize is that the expertise to produce those models is not a standing national capacity it's mostly a volunteer force of academics who produce those models this approach stands in stark contrast to weather forecasting which the nation has invested in for decades through the National Weather Service we don't have anything like that for outbreaks but this pandemic underscores why that must change we should consider establishing a national center that would perform epidemic forecasting and analytics and just briefly one other longer-term priority that I think should be considering or opportunity rather is that we put enormous resources into developing medical countermeasures for threats that we have previously identified but we don't have dedicated programs for what we call it disease X or these new pathogens that we didn't know existed until suddenly they are an enormous threat and so I think we should be thinking about how we could stand up programs and fund resources to develop the tools we need to expand our capacities and raise the bar of readiness for those pathogens that we don't know anything about but that we could be facing at any point so in conclusion thanks to the leadership of the House Appropriations Committee the country has made important progress towards combating this pandemic we must prioritize the strengthening of capacities and diagnostic testing contact tracing and the health system so we can successfully combat the virus in the weeks months and years to come thank you thank you so much dr. rivers at some point I would love to talk to you about your idea on a a center akin to the national weather weather service it's a try to find out more about it I'm gonna as in the past we will proceed to five minute rounds alternating back and forth by seniority as members were seated at the beginning of the taste hearing we're going to be respectful of our witnesses and trying to give them enough time to respond to two questions I will move forward dr. Frieden and dr. rivers both of you have ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rovided recommendations about the type of state and local capacity that needs to be in place before scaling back limitations on economic or social activity according to reports disease modelers are projecting the country is moving in exactly the opposite direction according to a range of projections new daily cases of Kovach 19 could surge this month and some are projecting that deaths could rise to 3,000 each day and I would just like to ask a series of questions of each of you to the best of your knowledge is there a single state that has met the necessary parameters to ease restrictions we suggest in our a I report that she mentioned at the beginning of the session that there are four criteria that states should meet in order to safely reopen and not all states have adopted these criteria but I'll review them just as a starting point the first it's just to see the number of new cases decline for at least two weeks and some states have met that criteria but there are three other criteria and they we suggest they should all be met the other is enough public health capacity to conduct contact tracing on all new cases enough diagnostic testing to test everybody with kovat like symptoms not just those people with severe illness and enough healthcare system capacity to treat everyone safely to my knowledge there are no states that meet all four of those criteria dr. Frieden there any single state that meets the criteria laid out I have not looked at all of the data from all states but I would make two comments one there may be areas within states that are closer than others to meeting that and second as I said in my opening testimony open versus closed is not a strict on/off switch there are things that are always open essential services essential retail hospitals emergency facilities and there are things that might be first to open out of doors is way less risky than inside lower risk businesses take out from restaurants outdoor recreation even daycare if done very carefully and safely may be lower risk so I think we need to think of this as a dimmer rather than an on/off switch just a quick follow-up here and then I want to get to items any state testing 1% of its population every week just know no any state of region been able to reduce the basic reproductive number below one meaning that the epidemic is no longer growing there is some evidence that some states have dr. rivers you are the lead author of a report where you're making recommendations to the governor's typically reopening will increase the risk of Kovach 19 spread therefore it is important for leaders to know that getting things open again we'll increase the risks of individuals contracting Kovach 19 and there is no way to completely guard against that let me ask this of both of you should the country be reopening now are we ready is it irresponsible to open the economy without adequate testing I think there is an enormous need to balance public health with the economic pressures and so I think that's what we see factoring into decisions I think as even as we move towards reopening and as some states make that decision we still need to be focusing on increasing our capacities to do diagnostic testing and to do contact tracing the time the window we have to implement those interventions is still open and so I don't think it's either/or I would say that we need to continue to rapidly ramp up our ability to do all of the four things I mentioned not just test but also isolate people who are infected contact trace and quarantine by having all of those things in place we can come out safer and sooner and we start our economy without a risk of explosive spread I know it was it was dr. Fauci who in the last several days who said how many deaths and how much suffering are we willing to accept if you want to get back to some sense of normalcy what is your sense of what is acceptable in terms of deaths or suffering to be able to get back to normalcy if we don't have the public health public health professionals advising us I think we need to continue to prioritize Public Health we have seen that several other countries have regained control of their outbreaks South Korea Singapore Australia we can do that too it's going to be difficult and it's going to take a lot of investment in our communities but option remains open to us I would just add we have to ensure that we protect our health care workers and other essential workers they are not making a choice they are doing their duty in protecting and providing essential services and we have to do everything possible to keep them safe and we have to pay particular attention to the most vulnerable such as our nursing homes large congregate facilities homeless shelters correctional facilities large factories where many people are working together where we can see explosive spread that can not only cause a lot of suffering death but also seed infections to elsewhere in the community it's the is that what the the criteria is how many deaths and suffering are we willing to accept in your view I think this is a balance we need to reopen so we can restart important medical care we need to reopen for our economy but we need to do that in a way that is careful and doesn't risk an explosion of cases that sends us back into our homes thank you yield now to my colleague congressman cotton thank you madam chair and I want to thank both of you for your excellent testimony and again for the papers you submitted dr. Frieden let me start with you I'm very intrigued by the idea you've presented about a special health defense budget sort of the equivalent of what and defense we'd call OCO spending that is something outside the caps we just recognize we're war we spend what it takes to win the war regardless whatever budget mechanisms and I think this is you know you and I have had this discussion the Chairman and I have had this discussion about particulars that need perhaps to be exempted could you go through it a little bit more to fail and talk to us about what specific accounts in your view we would need to sort of set outside the normal budget process and say when it comes to public health and threats that are merged we're gonna have to be free to spend what we need in these areas thank you very much and I appreciate all of your commitment to this issue over the years we've discussed it for many years and what we've seen is if it's in discretionary no matter how well intentioned everyone is there are going to be problems if it's in mandatory no matter how fixed we think it is it isn't so what we've suggested is something similar to the overseas contingency account that allows for a professional judgment of what's needed and if we can enter into the record a letter sent to both Senate and House leaders yesterday and signed by a former Senate Majority Leader's that fished and Daschle as well as myself and multiple other former CDC directors bill faggy David Satcher Jeff madam chair I'd ask that we could in event letter if we made to the record and that it also includes budget line examples of which would be included there squarely in the area of protecting Americans we wouldn't want to choose between our military radar defense and another part of the budget in the same way we shouldn't have to choose between this kind of defense and another part of our budget mr. Cole you've said over the years that Americans are far more likely to be killed by a pandemic than by a terrorist attack and I'm afraid the past month has shown that to be quite prescient in the same way I think we have to recognize that there other than nuclear war there's nothing else that can kill 10 million people around the world except a biological event and we have to do everything in our power to prevent that from happening so the approach is essentially twofold one you identify the budget lines you make them off budget through this HDO or some other mechanism similar to the Osio account and second tightly related to that you require a bypass professional judgment do not stop at go do not get cut 200 by OMB give the actual professional judgment from what's needed so that in Congress and in public you can assess that and then put in all of the accountability metrics for what we expect to see for the monies that are being spent this is not a piggy bank this is a specific investment in building up our national defense now I'm sure I'd suggest that something we need to work on together and maybe submit together for the consideration of our colleagues because it will take you know obviously agreement between the House the Senate and the executive branch I think it's a very good idea and dr. rivers let me turn to you if I may and again I very much enjoyed reading your paper and your testimony you made two points that were particularly striking to me probably because I agreed with them which was one your concern about everybody well you know we just appropriated 25 billion dollars for additional testing I'm not sure exactly what we're doing with it you know whether we really have a program set up and running for it same thing about your point on contact tracing this is an enormous Lee you know intensive manpower type operation particularly something this this size so what are the sorts of things you would recommend that we do that you would say okay this would be an adequate testing program this would be an adequate contact tracing program we've heard from many experts over the last few weeks different plans for what testing capacity we should have and what we would do with that capacity I'm suggesting we actually start at the other side and figure out what are the components and where is the room to go up on all of those components that's the part that's not clear to me as an epidemiologist I could say sure if we could test everybody once a week that would get us this if it were every two weeks we would have these options but it's not clear to me which of those plans is actually feasible and so I think it's really important that we go step by step and figure that out and I think we need a national plan in order to do that effectively I don't think C it should be left to do it independently in terms of contact tracing in addition to using that as an approach for containment I think we should be prioritizing data collection CDC recently put out new guidance for how data collection during contact tracing should rather how data could be collected during contact tracing and it does incorporate many of the data elements that I think would be really useful so progress has been made just in the past week on that I think next we should be sure that that data gets reported and analyzed I think all of the state health department's should be reporting in and I think the CDC should as well thank you very much thank you madam chair thank you and now like to recognize congressman Katherine Clark thank you for being here thank you very much madam chairwoman is good to see everyone here and thank you so much for being with us we understand that the testing is part of what we need to collect the data that you so aptly described as the weapon that is going to help us defeat this virus and get our economy working up and I very much like your image of a dimmer switch where we can dial things up and down because we want parts of our economy or or places in our different states to be able to open if they can safely do it but I think it comes back to your box diagram and it starts with testing and as you described dr. rivers we are under testing right now if our goal and I'd be interested if you both agree the goal is one percent of the United States population once a week so that would be roughly 3.8 million tests and we're now at 1.6 so do you agree that that 1% is is the bet the right benchmark we should be aiming for I think that is in the right ballpark but I would make the point that we don't want to test 1% of America evenly distributed right we wanted to be focused on people who are symptomatic healthcare workers essential essential workers and I would just add to that we issued an outline a briefing note of who we think needs to be tested by priority level because you could test 1% but exactly as dr. River said if you test the wrong 1% you're not going to be optimally controlling you have to look at those with symptoms most likely to spread most likely to die in congregate facilities healthcare workers with symptoms contacts who are symptoms symptomatic hospitalized patients even without symptoms because they can spread it widely all people in a nursing home if there is a case there because there can be explosive spread essential workers who are asymptomatic so I think it's key to look at the numbers but our estimate is that you would need at least two or three times a current volume even if you only tested the highest priority people to do it but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot we can't do at the same time to ramp up our other things because it's not going to be one thing gets us out of this accept a vaccine that's right and so we have to do all these things but with the tests to get to where we need to be to be testing those essential workers part of my understanding is the test that we are using now is inefficient and expensive and requires a lot more of the swabs and other equipment that we frankly are just having shortages of so where are we with point-of-contact testing more instant testing and even if their accuracy is not as good as the current test we're using is it worth it if it is more widely distributed and lets us test more of these essential workers and people at the greatest risk there are two broad ways of testing for the virus itself through looking for the genetic particles like the PCR that's being done and looking for antibodies I'll leave antibody testing aside because there are many unknowns about it with the point-of-care testing for the virus there are some systems that are relatively rapid now but they're low throughput so you're only going to be testing a few people each hour or people over a four-hour period so that rapid point of care needs to be looked at there are newer technologies and older technologies that may be helpful but you're always going to have to take a good sample and you're always going to have to be looking for a tiny amount of Jenner genetic material so your idea of a test that would have what we would call a low sensitivity but still a high specificity in other words some false negatives but it could rule someone in would be very helpful but does not yet exist on the market what what are some of the limiting factors for reaching just the sheer number of tests that we're going to need and how can we address them as we look at putting together a budget that can really use this develop the data we need I tried in earnest to find this out and I wasn't able to determine what the gaps are and I think in itself is a big problem I think continuing to bring new platforms onto the market will be helpful but then what about swaps and what about the PPE that the health care workers need to take the samples it's opaque to me and I think that's something we could fix I have just a few minutes left I would just say that it at this point I can't underscore and agree with you more on the need for a national plan and that states are too interconnected and we need to be learning from each other and how this virus is being spread and how we can best do these things test isolate trace and quarantine and safely bring our economy open that's the goal of everybody here but we need to support that in a national way thank you madam chair thank you very much and since I come from one of the stay at home states and represent a fairly rural district you know a lot of what I'm going to talk about is why we should treat everything uniform I mean rural areas are can be treated differently because the disease burden is less the strain on the hospital system etc etc so first of all well doctor free new said I think I quote here shelter in place is blunt but effective we don't really have scientific data on that for coronavirus do we because if you plot actually the what the states have done versus their or the severity of the measures states have gone versus their case counts you actually find the states with less restrictions in place sometimes have lower case counts examples Florida so we really have no date a specific objective data about that do we prospectively looked at for their coronavirus for kovat 19 for kovat 19 if we look at information from around the world it's very clear that when people stay home it reduces the spread but it's also clear doctor that there are countries including Singapore and South Korea that been able to limit the amount of physical restrictions or physical distancing and still control the virus and there are differences in different environments so Florida for instance didn't put in stay at home but their case rate is lower than Maryland's for instance right there are many factors that go into what the case rate is that's right so so so my point is that that shelter-in-place might work but it might be just the fitness the social distancing the shelter in place obviously implies now dr. rivers I looked at the recommendations from AEI there a month old is that right yes so we've learned a lot in the last month haven't we about this disease so for instance as we ramp up testing the first criteria is that your case count has to go down well as you ramp up testing you're gonna find cases that you wouldn't have found so for instance I'm sure you're aware there's a Michigan prison where they tested all their prisoners 60% tested positive they were asymptomatic in an Ohio prison 73% tested positive the vast majority asymptomatic so they're clearly asymptomatic cases around and as you ramp up testing so what you're going to do is you can be chasing your tail in now since the entire purpose of restrictions was to minimize stress on the healthcare system right because we want our healthcare system take care of people so that they don't die then why wouldn't hospitalizations or ICU occupancy even more importantly be the benchmark because in Maryland we've plateaued in ICU utilizations but our case counts continue to go up as we begin to go into a hot spot for instance the processing facilities poultry processing facilities well you go in there there are a lot of healthy people they may have corona virus but they're otherwise healthy they're asymptomatic you're gonna start testing them you're gonna find a whole lot of cases but that doesn't mean that your community's health care system is overstrained so why would you choose cases and not hospitalizations or ICU utilization as your benchmark I would add to your statement that the purpose of lockdowns or stay-at-home orders it's true was to prevent overwhelming our healthcare system but it was also to give us time to build up our capacities to do case based management and I think we shouldn't lose sight of that so let me talk a little about case based management a lot has been said about contact tracing doctor rivers what is the procedure for every case that we have diagnosed what's your estimate of the number of cases that exist that are asymptomatic people were asymptomatic they never had symptoms so they would never be detected for contact tracing emerging evidence is that about 25 to 50 percent of cases are asymptomatic but those people would still be affected by quarantine now you do know the the the in Stockholm the estimate is that for every case that's identified there are 73 cases that haven't been identified is that right do you know that you're aware of that statistic they have not shared their scientific data so although we have the technology it's reported you can google it it's reported so 70 so so if we concentrate on contact tracing and that's the you know that's our gold standard is we have to have contact tracing for every patient we contact trace we could have 10 20 people who are out there asymptomatic not contact tracing and the description of contact tracing as well you know we're gonna educate the people who are infected and the people they could have come come in contact with about what the good you know public health measures are wouldn't it be more effective we've just educated everybody because we really don't know who's an asymptomatic carrier that is educate everyone you know wear a mask when you go out in public so you don't spread the disease make sure you wash your hands make sure you don't touch you touch your face your nose you met you know these are the things as doctors we have known for years look we know how to how to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses what we're doing so now educating the broader population but to say that we're gonna do this through contact testing and not very broad education I think means we're going to we're going to we're gonna set a standard you know to train a hundred thousand people nationwide intense through contact tracing could take weeks I have small business owners in my state who in my district tell me they can't last weeks they're gonna go out of business so uh you tell me dr. rivers why a business owner in my district who sees five customers in a store for an entire day can't safely operate with social distancing masks and hand hygiene I don't think the economy will be able to recover robustly if people are afraid of getting infected in the community and so I think it's to the advantage of the economy if we can implement it and regain control using cases you think it's dangerous for that store owner to open up their store using CDC guidelines and we won't even get into because I was gonna ask him maybe in a second round I will why the who guidelines to the World Health Organization guidelines are so much different from the CDC guidelines so you think it's dangerous for that store owner to open that I think customers won't want to visit if they don't have come that's their choice isn't it only customers thank you I yield back thank you madam chair and dr. rivers and dr. Frieden thank you very much for taking the time to be here with us today I want to ask you about Cova 19 in rural communities it's the district that I represent in the northwest corner of the state of Illinois 85% of the towns are five thousand people are fewer sixty percent of the towns or a thousand people are fewer so that gives you a picture of the kind of district that I represent there are people who think that Cova 19 is less serious in rural areas and in outside of you know not highly populated not high density of population and so a couple examples that I want to share with you of what we're seeing in this congressional district we have a hundred and two counties in the state of Illinois two of those counties one is called Warren County which is in the congressional district I serve has a population about 17,000 people so so not not a large population it now has the fifth highest number of cases per capita in the state of Illinois another County is Stevenson County it's on the Wisconsin state line has a population of about 44,000 people the number of cases Cova 19 cases there are doubling every five days all right so that is the third fastest rate in the state of Illinois so just want to give you a little purse back so you know I know like if you look nationally we have many many governors now who are pushing for our country to reopen and I'm certainly in their own States looking at reopening and there are also these ideas that you can we can reopen in a state in tears you know where it's less populated and versus where it's more populated so wondering if you can address that along the lines of what resources and practices do we need to know in more of these rural areas what do we need a certain level of testing maybe if you can just drill down of how it's different in rural America versus you know towns like cities like Chicago or New York and this is addressed to both of you I'd like to hear from both of you on this if I could please well first I would say that in general the challenges in urban areas may be more severe what to do about crowded subway systems bus systems very close quarters in the US and globally is something that we have not yet figured out and is an enormous challenge but no area is immune we don't have immunity to this virus and in each community there may be nursing homes there may be factories there may be other facilities where there is potential for a lot of spread and there may be less access for the kind of intensive care that is needed in some rural areas of the country I think something doctor ever said is is really important to highlight and that is the importance of data we are learning more about this virus every day the famous Nobel laureate Josh Lederberg used to say the microbes outnumber us it's their numbers against our brains and we have to use intelligence to figure out what the weaknesses of the virus are to understand for example where it's spreading what are the highest risk things I talked about two dichotomies in my testimony open versus closed it's really a question of degree different things second was public health versus the economy in fact together we can resolve another forced academy is safe and risky it's really safer and riskier so we need to make as much of our environment by design by changing the way we go about our business as safe as possible reduce risk and we'll do that by understanding more through things like contact tracing where the disease is spreading and how to reduce it spread most effectively thank you I would just add that rural areas have seen less explosive growth which is encouraging but they also tend to have less capacities and so I worry that a community may have a manageable level of transmission until a congregate setting like a correctional facility or a nursing home becomes infected and then suddenly the local hospital might have 25 high acuity patients that need to be admitted and the hospital might not be able to accommodate that and so I think that's the kind of search capacity that we need to be planning for is supporting rural communities when they do have a change in their epidemiology I've got 34 seconds left Rosa can may I ask a second question that follows up on this so I'm speaking of correctional facilities we have two federal prisons in the congressional district I serve and I don't know if you've been following this case very or this this topic very closely but the the Marshal Service has turned over inmates to the Bureau of Prisons to go to 11 different prisons throughout the the country for transfer of patients that are not tested for Kovan 19 one of those prisons is in Thompson Illinois this is in a county called Carroll County zero hospitals they're you'd have to travel over across the Mississippi River to Iowa to go to the hospital or a County to the north or County to the south so wondering about screening the proper screening that should happen before the transfer of any patients or I'm sorry any inmates to another prison if you can talk about what would best practices look like for transferring prisoners from one facility to another well the best prayer would be to minimize transfers first and foremost because anytime you're mixing more people you're creating the possibility of explosive spread you would certainly want to ensure that no one who's symptomatic is transferred the challenge is that we recognize that there are a lot of asymptomatic people some of them pre-symptomatic they'll develop symptoms in the next couple of days and some of them will remain asymptomatic and they do appear to be able to spread the infection that's why even symptom screening will be a problem and in every congregate facility we need a comprehensive approach to reducing the risk that the virus will get in increasing the likelihood we'll find it quickly if it does and improving our ability to stop it from spreading widely if it's spreading and I which is that if there was an opportunity to use diagnostic testing one misstep or miscalculation that people sometimes make is to think that just because you have a negative diagnostic test means you're not infected the situation you would want to avoid is when you test someone early in the incubation period and so they're already infected but there's not enough virus yet for the test to pick up and so it builds over the coming days and you think you're gonna clear and you're not so coupling or timing the testing with a quarantine period would be recommended all right thanks to you about that I yield back thank you madam chair so one thing and this is probably for both both y'all one thing we've learned from this pandemic is that the importance of domestic production of essential medicine and medical supplies and I could add to it many other things but obviously this is what's being highlighted especially in over reliance on China however knowing how many tests we need what we've just talked about and how many vaccines 300 million plus etc I worry there's no way to completely produce all of that within the United States at present possibly even with our adjacent allies this presents a serious threat to our security and our public health I know that's something we're going to look at prospectively but we're still in the middle of this how would you rate our current domestic production capability and what steps do we need to be taking right now today to improve them I think this pandemic has emphasized the interconnectedness of the world including both the ability of viruses and other infectious agents to spread and the fragility of some of the supply chains from a variety of products including the active pharmaceutical ingredients of many of our medications when it comes to PPE personal protective equipment there are means to increase production of safely reusable PPE such as elastomeric half face piece and 95 respirators this was as an important technology that is not new it's been around for a while it's been used increasingly but it allows a healthcare worker to have an n95 that can be safely disinfected between uses and used for months at a time so there are some technological improvements that can improve our supply chain in terms of vaccines and therapeutics we don't yet have any so we don't know how difficult they will be to manufacture when they do exist I believe there will be a global commitment to ensuring that there is essentially open-source so that once we know how to make it anyone can make it and in fact immediately even companies that had strongly opposed this for many years have agreed so I think there's a recognition it's a global good but the manufacturing capacity is something that I plan I apologize I have a couple more questions I appreciate that very much did you want to add to that should I keep going okay is was mentioned I flew very far to get here and I want to try and get through as many of these I can because this is so important and I appreciate your time what we have seen thus far it appears it appears that underlying health conditions diabetes and others impact the likelihood that a kovat 19 patient will require hospitalization additionally shutdown orders and concerns about exposure have left many impacted with chronic I think of end-stage renal disease and others delaying medical care pursuing alternative care sites such as home I think about people who are waiting for transplants perhaps a kidney transplant and they're getting told you know they have a donor a living donor and they're being told that's elective I don't know if you've ever been on life support waiting for kidney which is essentially what dialysis is doesn't feel very elective can you speak to the impact of the virus on those chronic disease communities and what you anticipate going forward and maybe they're not the immediately immediately hospitalized ones right well they're not in this immediate attention sphere but they're certainly impacted kid either of you speak to that just to acknowledge the importance of this question there are so many secondary impacts of this pandemic and those with underlying health conditions as you say not only are more likely to get severe disease when infected with Cova but are also struggling with managing their conditions and so I think this does need to be a priority both for this response and also as we do preparedness planning going forward thank you as folks here know Lucille roybal-allard and I chair the House maternity care caucus and while medical providers are taking all necessary precautions to protect mothers patients frontline workers as women are still giving birth surprise surprise certain things don't just stop because we all said it should we're where we are seeing mothers often forced to labor without partners or family members or midwives in fact I have a case of a mother who was potentially going to lose her baby and she could not I mean they knew it was a pre-existing condition and the father couldn't come with her she had her own merit called the baby lived but these are the types of things mothers are facing right now are as we work to better prepare our countries and our communities for future pandemics what recommendations would you give to providers and the maternal health community to better protect new and expectant mothers this is an area of someone outside of my expertise but I think access to personal protective equipment should be one of the primary resources our strategic national stockpile was not able to support all of the PPE needs for this pandemic and I think that's a lesson that we can take going forward that would benefit the maternity community and also health care workers broadly thank you go back if I might just tell my colleague that what we did do in terms of the manufacturing effort through billion I'm not enough to barter to support advanced research and development of vaccines therapeutics diagnostics prioritizing platform based technology with us-based manufacturing capabilities and in the cares Act there was at least 3.5 billion for Barda for the same effort so that the conversations are trying to move in the direction of having more independence in that area congressman not bonnie watson call me Thank You chairwoman I want to thank both of you for your coming here today and your testimony and also the work you've been doing in this in this area I know that we're gonna be safest when there's a vaccine I know we're gonna have dust ups when there is a vaccine as to whether or not everyone will take it my understanding of the development of a vaccine and and and and it's testing takes a while and that it's it could be years is there any substitution in the efficacy of a of that of Ivette developing the best vaccine that will countermeasure years dr. Frieden dr. rivers there's nothing more important in the fight against this virus and developing a vaccine this the quickest vaccine development so far historically has been about four years dr. Tony Fauci has suggested that 12 to 18 months is possible and all of us would like to see a vaccine as soon as possible there are many many vaccine candidates being considered and different models of assessing vaccine vaccine efficacy being developed already some of them are in phase one trials fundamentally we need on the one hand to do everything possible to get a vaccine as soon as possible on the other hand we need to recognize that vaccine development is uncertain and it may be a long time and it may not be as effective as we would like so we need to do everything possible to make a vaccine but we can't assume that we'll have one and we need to act accordingly with all of the other measures that we can dr. earth I would just add that identifying a safe and effective vaccine is just the first step and that we also need to think about manufacturing production and distribution because those are steps that can take a long time to but if we think and plan now we can also I think speed up the timeline on that at 30 minutes under what circumstances are asymptomatic people being tested now in this country there are various different situations most important is when there is an outbreak in a congregate facility so if there's a case in a nursing home we would think everyone in that nursing home needs to be tested what about outside of a facility we're seeing some testing done to release people from isolation that may not be necessary or effective you don't really know what a faintly positive test means in that circumstance but contacts of cases could ideally be tested to see if they're infected because if they're infected then contact tracing needs to be done in them also but dr. rivers may have more to say on this I agree with testing people without symptoms it's not currently one of the higher priorities on the CDC priority list and so there's not a lot so that is a concern to someone like me I am over 65 years old I've got some of those conditions that have been raised as potential issues I can't just stay home so I need people to be tested in general so that I know that I'm in a more safe environment and a less safe environment how long do you think it would take us to get there and isn't it reasonable if not feasible isn't it necessary to get there universal testing is a strategy that it's not clear to me we will ever have the capacity to carry out that and I mean it's not clear to me it could be that we do but I'm not sure but an alternate approach is contact tracing that would allow us to regain control if done if those the level and scale necessary so you've outlined a series of conditions that are more optimum for us to be able to open up and come out and do things where are we exactly right now this week right now where are we on that sort of spectrum enough testing and of contact tracing enough isolating enough alternative facilities for quarantine where are we right now okay either one and booth can answer I can start us off right now most states and most communities are still staying home to slow the spread as we start to move into Phase two which would be a gradual reopening many some communities do you have sufficient diagnostic testing many communities do not States thanks to the preparations of this committee have funding now to hire more contact tracers but I think that that capacity is still in progress so we like in phase one and a half we are looking ahead to Phase two I would say the way we think of it is there three things you want to look at one is what's happening with the virus our our severe infection is coming down and our estimated number of cases coming down controlling for the amount of testing to our our healthcare system is robust so our health care workers aren't getting infected on the job and so that we have the capacity to treat a surge to manage ongoing conditions like pregnancy safely and three is our public health system ready to box it in with contact tracing isolation I would say that there are some communities in some parts of the US that are getting ready to do that but all of us need to have vigilance it's not about relaxing it's about increasing vigilance so that we can prevent explosive spread and save lives and restore our economy I just don't know how close we are to that I see I'm confused as to where we are and when we do allow states and they'll the governor's allow them to open inner cities I'd like to know what kind of indicators are public health professionals willing to say or should say that you need to shut it back down or that it's okay to continue in that direction and I just AM NOT oh I'm not knowledgeable about that then and I don't get the impression that in general we are we've looked at that specifically when to loosen and when to tighten again and the things that we would look at are things like consistent increasing case counts increases in what's called syndromic surveillance which is an early indication health care systems that are beginning to get overwhelmed and a public health system that can't do to box it in well so we don't know where the cases are coming from and there are unlink cases in the community that's the optimal way but I think we recognize that part of the stay at home may be able to be changed without undue risk for example outdoor activities and other things with physical distancing and when we go out it's not going to be back to normal it's going to be to a new normal with hand sanitizer and perhaps face masks where it's spreading widely and no touch doors and no touch elevator buttons and lots of ways to engineer risk out of our lives thank you I yield back I forgot I had my mask on I can just breathe for a second thank you very much I yield back I just to follow up for a second for a question but the American people deserves the truth the American people it's on the one hand it's here and on the one hand it's that we're and we are looking to you to understand you know we hear on on TV and this is the ordinary person we have access to probably other kinds of information but it's vaccine how many how many are being reviewed what are various different lines of reviewed are the main ones are there 40 and up that 40 there are only two that are real is there a national testing plan I believe you said no we do not have a national testing plan we do not have a national contact tracing plan we do not have PPE no command and control of what that is and where it is going and the American people are scared they are scared they don't know what to believe and they may not go into that business that dr. Harris talked about and they're not look at the polling data they're not going so what do we get to and we need are the CDC guidelines on the testing being followed honey yes or no I mean because I wanted to be mindful of my colleagues time as well are those CDC guidelines being followed about who gets tested and who doesn't or is it just a jump ball I mean that's the way it appears to me that we do not have a kind of a central control of what is happening as you have pointed out in the worst pandemic going back to 2002 to 1918 so how are the American people going to get the answers that they need how are we you need to tell us what public policy initiatives need to be put in place you have a subcommittee here it is bipartisan it is critically important and so many of these pieces are within our jurisdiction that we need to understand we're not foolish enough to know that there's not absolute clarity but he'll give us more clarity than we have now in order to be able to provide the wherewithal so those who are in charge to carry out their mission on testing quick question should the CDC be in charge of that of that effort for the states be in charge of that effort and again I need quick answers because I'm gonna run out of time federal government needs to establish the guidelines provide the resources the implementation is done at the state and local level okay our state and local level does not have the resources today that it needs to do its job yes there are not enough tests currently well but a normal set of circumstances the public health infrastructure in this country is weak and it's being overrun not that it hasn't wanted to do the job it's being over run so as your point earlier we need to do something about that look we you know is there a plan if we have a vaccine how does it get manufactured how does it get prioritized are there people sitting down as far as you know now and I'm looking to the scientists I'm looking to you because we know it havoc politics can play and I put that aside your the guideposts give us the plan and let us know absolutely and when the American public can say it's not going to happen for 18 months you're not dumb we need truth and facts at this time I was not prepared to just go in this direction but we cannot say on the one hand this and on the one hand that if we are going to get out of this and give us the posts to get us out of this the pillars that help us to gain that control so that we can move forward as a country went over my time apologize Tom the Chairman you never go over your time madam chair and I respect that and respect the concerns that you went through let me get because I think the chair is right we're looking for specifics so let me ask a very specific question to both of you I think one of the you know early lessons from this is we certainly didn't have the the public lab testing capabilities let's say that we needed to respond as quickly as all of us would have liked to respond so just ask you in your professional opinion is that true and number two how would you go about remedying that so that would be point one number two and and I could be wrong about this and would be happy to be corrected I also thought we were a little slow getting our private sector partners into the fight for whatever reason I don't know if there's a barrier there I don't know if it you know we have to assure the market I realize these are for-profit companies they have to make money but I don't think we mobilize them nearly as rapidly as we probably should have in retrospect so the two questions would be what do we need to do to get our public health labs up to where they need to be what mechanisms that we need to be in place so that if we find ourselves in an all-out war with a microbe we have everybody on the field as quickly as we can get them there just to tie together your two questions we've spent a lot of money and time on Hospital preparedness and making sure that our private medical facilities are able to respond to a mass casualty event we don't have something like that for Diagnostics and I think we should because it's not just public health labs although we should be working to increase their capacities it's also the private sector as you mentioned and so I think we should have some sort of unifying preparedness program for how we will make sure we are not caught in this position again when it comes to Diagnostics I mean it's certainly the truth that the public health laboratories at national state and local levels are antiquated they're not using the latest technologies they're still using fax machines it's the testing methodologies it's information technology and so that's something that needs to be upgraded it's also the case that we need to look at new platforms and newer diagnostic technologies there are innovations coming and they're not cheap they will be expensive but you want to keep your fire department there in case there's a fire in the same way you want to keep your lab ready unfortunately the lab is often the poor relation in the healthcare infrastructure and for this kind of a response it's really a three legged stool you have the public health system doing Public Health laboratory testing you have Hospital laboratories developing their own tests and you have the private sector coming in with large volumes and in this case all three of them had problems you know we actually dealt a little bit of that one of our last hearings before we were overtaking the CDC was actually talking about developing a plan in terms of the technological updates they needed bring it to us I would hope you know they've obviously been dealing with a lot but I hope that has not to slip through the cracks because we're gonna need something like that I think going forward and that's a very specific investment that we can make let me ask you a very different question if I may we've talked a lot about vulnerable groups and we know we certainly have vulnerable we have health disparities in the country we have minority groups we have lower-income groups we have a lot of people that find themselves with higher degree of vulnerability much worse outcomes than the population in general and I want to talk about that maybe it had played around but I also want to asked about children I've had an interesting occasion I was mentioning to dr. Harris where I was talking to ambassador from a friendly European country during all this I said what are you doing and so one of the things we're doing in terms of getting back is we're actually opening our school a lot faster than you guys are because our children are not particularly vulnerable and a lot of their parents are in their 30s and 40s they're the workers that we actually need to get the economy going up again and they're not as vulnerable obviously as others so you have any thoughts in terms of number one what is happening with younger people in this number two and not asking for master blueprint and what we should do but what would I do have concerns about the school system and getting kids back up and operational and parents more able to get to the workplace thankfully we are able to observe that children are a lower risk of severe illness that's something we've seen in other countries it's something we're seeing in the United States and so that's encouraging what we don't know is what role of children play in transmission we know from pandemic influenza or rather influenza generally that children are really central to transmission in the community not just in schools but the community broadly we haven't been able to pin down the science yet of what exactly the role is of children and transmission and so that's where you see a lot of the uncertainty these two factors weigh against each other and they get very difficult to come to a decision so I suggest that as other countries move toward reopening which is happening some countries are going back to school in the coming weeks they will be collecting data and doing the analyses that will let us understand what the role of children is and I think that will be helpful for informing our decision I would agree with all of that I would just say it we don't know why children and women are less likely to get severe illness with kovin 19 it's a clue for something about the virus but as we reopen we want to prioritize societal benefit for example daycares if we keep out from daycare kids who have underlying condition and staff who are older who have underlying conditions at risk that may be a way of starting to reopen but we also have to consider if those kids get infection the staff get infection and come home and they're living with their grandparents are they at risk there and we don't know but I do think that there's a valid argument to be made for a sooner reopening of areas with younger people because of the lower risk but you have to do it in a way that minimizes risk and recognizes the vulnerable population that need to be protected as well as the risk of onward transmission thank you very much thank you madam chair thank you madam chair and thank you again for all of this I wanted to just start with a broad question if you could name a country that you think is doing a good job and if they have a national plan Singapore has done a very good job and they do have a national plane any others oh come to mind there are many countries that are that are do any of them not have a national plan do do any countries who successfully have done this have said we're gonna do this regionally or by city I think there's a varying degree of centralization and decentralization in different countries so even Germany which has a very effective response has a very decentralized form of government so there is a strong national guidance but regional implementation of that guidance in as far as I understand yeah but they certainly have a more unified health care system for delivery yes as we look at testing essential workers I think it's easier to think about health care workers but how do we how do you start to look at one area that I'm very interested in to follow up on the ranking members question is child care child care is critical to reopening our economy we are not going to have success if we don't have child care system which has been so underfunded and teetering at the brink would you see sort of employer based testing is that how we would you know with a child care center it may be smaller would you test every teacher within those essential would you be looking at auto manufacturing plants would you test every one coming on to the floor or would you do something more like what dr. Gottlieb suggested testing everybody who shows up at a doctor's office whether that's a for a sprained ankle or for symptoms of coronavirus I'll make a brief comment and I completely agree that daycares childcare is particularly important and we've highlighted that in the tears from resolved to save lives from day one that this may be an area that can open sooner as long as we do it safer which means if there's a kid with an underlying condition they shouldn't go in if there's a staff with an underlying condition they shouldn't go in we should use hand sanitizer frequently I think the the the potential of mass testing is just that it's a potential in order to do that kind of testing you're talking about tens of millions of tests a day and as exactly as dr. Versailles we don't know whether that will be feasible but I don't think it's realistic to wait to reopen some of the most critical aspects of society until there is that kind of capacity I agree with coming back to not having clarity about what kind of capacity we can expect but I also um I think we need to understand more about the logistics of how that would work if you had a point-of-care test that could be right here that can only test five people an hour how would that work if you have an entire daycare center that needs to be tested I think there are probably ways around that but it hasn't been worked out and so my point is I don't think that we should rely on having that capacity I think we will have to be prepared to move forward without it so how would you see getting these you know getting the testing done for the one percent that I understand will will vary in region in the country will vary how do you see that going forward do you see something like dr. Gottlieb suggested where it would be people who come in to doctors offices so that you're getting a random sample starting with people who have symptoms and the nice thing about contact tracing is once you get in that network and once you are connected to people who are infected and the people who might get infected because they have been exposed you can continue to follow the network outward and so you don't have to be as concerned about checking here there and everywhere because you really start to get a handle on transmission in the community so this sort of brings us back to where we started that to even open something essential like child care that we're going to need to open quickly and support as we're looking at tremendous you know instability in a critical underpinning of our economy we can't begin to do that until we have robust testing and try Singh and Quarantine II the sooner we established the boxes and strategy of test isolate contact trace from quarantine the sooner and safer we can reach thank you thank you so um let me just ask them about the box it in strategy so dr. Frieden how many people do you think there are asymptomatic for everyone that we have a diagnosed that because you know we talk about the number of cases but we should be very specific we mean the number of cases confirmed by testing and of course what is your impression how many cases are there that aren't confirmed by testing the asymptomatic well there's two different questions there one is how many people were symptomatic and not tested and then how many people are asymptomatic and not tested so the number of infections we've documented is a small fraction of the total and what fraction do you think that is it depends on the area of the country and the ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evel of the test so it could be kind of high right so so how do you box in something when you're not recommending testing asymptomatic people but you know they're asymptomatic people out there and again it comes to the to to my question why wouldn't we just have very intensive education processes so that every American follows social distancing wearing a mask and you know hand hygiene they so we kind of hammer this in because these are the principles and get a test if you're symptomatic so I think that's correct I think we can do both and we have to do both because this is a very infectious virus and it's very deadly fluttering but the but the criteria for reopening include the need and I've seen this where it's been suggested don't reopen until you have contact testing in place what we can say is you will be safer if you're able to open with contact we're safer if we're not born we're safer from death if we're not born right I mean the bottom line is there's some element of risk and I bring this back to the competin you know stay at home might work in New York because if you leave your home in New York you're gonna get on a train you're gonna get on a subway you're gonna get in a crowded street but if you're in my in parts of my district you're gonna leave home get in your car or truck drive to a store that has almost no customers in it conduct your business and go back home because that's normally the way you live so why would you insist that or why is there insistence that stay at home is a the broad blanket statement it's effective because I will I'm not sure it adds anything more in the instance I just gave you in a rural area so why do we have a kind of one-size-fits-all approach when we can be much more nuanced about it I think the concept of physical distancing is an important one and in the scenario you outline if the individual goes to the store and for example calls in advance picks up the order at the front that's a very low-risk interaction if you go out and and work outdoors that's a very low-risk interaction right so so I would suggest you know I've visited and you know a couple of the stay-at-home things that just didn't don't make sense to me recreational boating is prohibited in my state so a family that stays at home eats at home they don't wear masks at home they can't go out get on their boat and go out in the outdoors golf courses this you know outdoor there these there are guidelines in place that would absolutely physically separate you from other people these things that again nuanced approaches that you know stay at home is also you know one size fits all everybody got to stay at home no matter what it is you're going outside to do can't we get more nuanced given the data we have and knowing how social distancing wearing a mask hand hygiene we will likely be the major way to stop spread of this in some circumstances I think that's generally correct one other factor to consider is environmental contamination kovat is spreading like a super stars and we know that SARS through elevator buttons door handles and other ways so we have to think also about re-engineering some of our environments so we have no touch doors and we reduce the number of contaminated surfaces and clean them more reliably this is about adjusting to a new normal and the sooner we do that the sooner we can get our economies back without unduly stressing our health and health care systems sure just two or two additional things one kind of novel ideas that are coming forward one is the ability to test because nasal swabs are a problem but my understanding their tests now that being licensed that work on sputum so just salivary tests after that and what do you think the effect of that will be on unavailable testing the other one are the the new antivirals that are being spoken about obviously REM Desa vir you know made by Gilead which took money from the money they made from hepatitis C drugs and you know reinvested in helping us cure this as well as the monoclonal antibody discovery in Israel reported I think two or three days ago with these change the playing field I think we have to see that we're learning more about this every single day and the more we learn the more we can do in a sputum testing is it is it likely that it will work that you can actually test if you're sensitive you know since it enough assay for virus and so you don't need a nasal swab I would need to see the data on it okay thank you yield back thank you madam chair wondering if you can share with us the the patient experience the the patient who has cope in nineteen goes to the hospital what's the how long is it taking there what's the treatment and then what's the hospital bill look like if you could maybe talk through that one thing is that for many patients it doesn't require a hospitalization and in areas of the country like New York City where there are overwhelming numbers of patients what has been said for the past couple of months is if you're just mildly ill stay home because you're going to come in and you're gonna use up scarce resources if you don't have it you might get in fact that if you do have it you might affect someone else and if you have it you'll just be told go home that may not be the right answer there might answer may be if you can't be safely cared for at home because you may in fact your grandmother or someone who's got cancer come into this facility and will care for you until you're no longer infectious and that's something that we need to think going forward but for someone who comes into the hospital what we're seeing is very low levels of oxygen in the blood and that's a big concern so oxygenation is a major component of care is probably the most important part of supportive care of someone with kovat and doctors in intensive care units are figuring out ways to support oxygenation without intubation and use of ventilators that's a new finding in intensive care and reduces the number of insulators we thought would be needed the what is that care if you don't need the there are a variety of ways to position patients or give oxygen through other means that don't require insertion of a bleep breathing tube and may be effective and then general supportive care for the individual making sure that they're well cared for we've seen very severely ill patients in cities that have been hard hit having a very low survival rate partly because they're so severely ill partly because systems are somewhat overwhelmed we're learning more about how to care for patients all the time there is potentially good news with REM death severe the antiviral it appeared to shorten the time to recovery in a well-done study that hasn't yet been released but the data has been shared it had a little bit about that reduce it by from 15 days to 11 days okay and it reduced mortality rate by about 30% although that difference wasn't statistically significant significant given the size of the sample so a trend a non significant trend toward a lower death rate okay I'm guessing if you are hospitalized this is going to result in probably thousands of dollars in hospital bills intensive care is extremely expense and do we have any hard numbers associated with what an average stay is going to look like for four patients I'm sorry okay all right in part of this I want to make an editorial comment in that congressman lloyd doggett congresswoman Susan wild and I have a bill that would call for the opening up of the re-enrollment for the Affordable Care Act right now when we have 30 million uninsured Americans and in the state of Illinois we have enough we have 800,000 uninsured Americans so I actually partially wanted you to go through that I mean we know this is going to be very costly I mean we know it by the you know the economic recovery bills that we're looking at but I just think it's critically important the Trump administration has pushed back on opening re-enrollment hours calls for an eight week period where people can can get in Berrian rolled in and the Affordable Care Act and I just think and dr. Frieden you've been obviously in the Obama administration very involved in the Affordable Care Act but I think that's important to note I mean what you just talked through is that's it's a long process glad that we're seeing some encouraging news out of the the treatment and the hospitals one asked you also about behavioral health if you can talk a little bit about that from a public health perspective what we're seeing as far as what's happening with behavioral health what we need to prepare for going forward and just what we can do as members of the Labor Health and Human Services subcommittee of appropriations as we look at that maybe we'll start with you dr. rivers yes I think this is an important area going back to our previous discussions about the secondary consequences of this pandemic and the support and treatment and continuity of care that people have had I think behavioral health is one area that is chronically underserved and under supported and I think it's very possible that in the context of this pandemic that those disparities will intensify I would just outline four areas of concern the first is interruption of needed care either ongoing care or need for a new care in a behavioral health area second is substance abuse and chemical dependency they need for treatment and potential increased need for treatment and care the acute trauma of grieving and losing family members or family members severely ill and also the responders first responders and health care workers I was health commissioner in New York City after 9/11 and we studied the impact of the World Trade Center attacks and we found that as severe as the respiratory impacts were of people caught in a dust cloud in terms of the amount of disability post-traumatic stress disorder depression and anxiety caused even more disabilities we have to take care of our responders during this time and limit their hours to the extent possible and provide good care and support I'm living Herrera Butler thank you madam chair you know on that last part with regard to mental health and and the impact this is having not just on our first responders although they are constantly in our hearts and minds because they're the ones that are taking it taking it in 24/7 one of the things I think with regard to you know congressman Harris's comments about kind of a nuanced approach to reopening I've just recently called on the federal government to reopen so Washington State we've we've been dialing it we dialed back we're starting to dial back open and this governor has reopened state state parks or at least he's put he's doing them in a phased approach hope people are able to leave their house go to a safe place that has a lot of space and distance but it has an impact especially you have family you know kids you're all in the house together and it lets them release a little bit I've just recently asked that the feds reopened the federal land in our area because they closed it off in in cooperation with the state when it made the close shut down order so now I think it's time to start opening those things off up I would like to know on the recreational side what types of things you see as nothing's 100% safe let's go ahead and throw that out but could help out balance out the the mental health piece you know I've been thinking and being very concerned about domestic violence and violence with regard to children you know the reports have gone way down because they're not in school and school you know educators aren't able to see things and make calls it's not that they're not happening so could you please speak to the health piece with regard to read opening some of these things I agree that outdoor areas are low risk for transmission and that there play a really important role in mental health and overall well-being and so I do support the reopening of those outdoor areas complete agreement would encourage actually that the only things you want to be careful about is where do people go after they go outdoors that they congregate in a bar inside and are there any things like doorknobs or spaces that are just can be easily reengineered to be safer and in addition I think as that public is more educated I don't I don't see anybody who I mean most people carry around hand sanitizer right you you use it before you touch your before you eat so you take your own lunch you go sit out there you're gonna gather up all your garbage you're gonna put your hand sanitizers around before you mean people I think I think we need to begin to show the American people that we are seeing and hearing their stress and not just the folks who are in the middle of the fight but those who are in rural areas those are held back you know we're almost a victim of our success in certain ways that we haven't had it I'm so grateful and we've worked very hard to not allow our local health systems in my district to be overwhelmed but because that isn't happening people aren't seeing the immediacy of the crisis and we have to respond to them in that and so that's I think that new wants especially coming from our public health experts is gonna help us I think it'll help in the long term with regard to adherence but it'll gain some trust the other the other thing I wanted to bring up and asked about was nursing homes obviously that is a hot spot and then they continue to be a significant portion of our kovat patients and Cova deaths including I think that's not just in my ear it's it's nationwide a high number of those patients who travel three times a week to dialysis or nursing home the two diocese are nursing home residents and this figure could increase during the pandemic what special protections can can we be looking at for these individuals for them and for the staff a lot of how these viruses have been spread originally could have been visitors but now they're really only their own outside act it's health care providers and/or their staff we've talked a lot about testing and when we should test and where we should test for me this is a really appropriate opportunity to do that Universal testing I think that all staff who are working in care settings should have access to tests and should be tested regularly for that exact purpose we know that nursing home residents are a very high risk of severe illness the virus spreads very easily in those settings and so I think that is the perfect opportunity to intervene I just completely agree I'm deeply concerned about nursing homes in fact exactly two months ago I said that nursing homes were ground zero for Cova 19 in the US and as I said in my opening statement unless urgent action has taken there will be at least a hundred thousand deaths in nursing homes in this country and that means taking a comprehensive approach making sure there's leadership in the nursing home at every level every unit every shift making sure we take a hierarchy of controls including source controls administrative engineering and personal controls cohorting staff and patients coming up with novel ways to try to keep staff and patients safe some nursing homes are paying staff after to stay there so they're not exposing others that's a very costly and difficult thing to do if if it turns out that antibodies reflect immunity maybe we can have people who have immunity care for others in nursing all we have to do something so that we don't have that kind of terrible devastation thank you you'll back mentor congresswoman Watson call me thank you liberated thank you folks um this has been a tremendous learning experience for me I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about our sense of connectivity to the rest of the world what do you think for instance is the true impact of the decision that our president made to withhold funding to the World Health Organization what do you think that that has in terms of a short-term mid-term or even long-term negative implication we're in the midst of the most severe public health endemic in a century w-h-o is our global health organization and we need to support it and make it stronger I think we can look with time to see do we need a different approach do we need a supplemental approach what are ways that it could be more effective I think every organization will need to look back and see how it could have been more effective but the w-h-o has a critical role to play and we hope it will be able to play that with ever-increasing effectiveness in the weeks months and years to come I wonder if you wanted to weigh in doctor I'll just add that we know from this experience and from everything we know about infectious diseases that a threat anywhere in the world is also a threat to the United States and so but I also like to point out that it's in our national interest to make sure that the rest of the world is able to respond effectively and whu-oh is the tool that we have to do that and to ensure that thank you another question I have about in support of all my colleagues have spoken to the need for a national plan cohesiveness in how we approach it how we deal with it through all the various phases and how we can create hopefully more dependability by having a national plan what is your reaction to the proposal to shut down the task force the coronavirus task force is it an okay thing is it problematic what should we be thinking about I would say it depends what comes next at resolved save lives an initiative of the Global Health Organization vital strategies we advise governments all over the world in how to prepare for and respond to an epidemic and one of the essential components of an effective response is a clear what's called incident management system where there is an incident manager in charge there is transparent information the incident manager reports up to the highest authority and raises the policy decisions that need to be made which are then made and implemented through the incident management system that is the best practice in how to handle an emergency like this so whatever structure is there I would hope it would follow that best practice I think that that has been one of our challenges is that we've had so many people on the same base at the same time just taking out little pieces and sometimes colliding with one another as they're trying to get to home plate and so to me it's very important that we have a cohesive plan of action a one voice and an agreement among all of the agencies that would be inputting into that I my other question has to do with the the minority communities the black community the Native Americans Hispanic and the very poor communities a lot of their access to health care has been diminished because of the health care facilities the FQHCs and stuff not operating to par if at all how what do we need to do to ensure that they are not deprived of either the therapies or the vaccine once it becomes available to the degree that the infection has disproportionately impacted those communities we've seen three problems one larger proportion of essential workers in some underrepresented communities to higher proportion of diabetes under controlled diabetes and other underlying health conditions and three lesser access to healthcare services if and when we have a vaccine it needs to be provided to those who need it most first that would be health care workers and other essential workers and as its rolled out to everyone everyone in society because that will protect you all of us I agree with dr. Frieden and I would just add that although we do not have a safe and effective vaccine yet that's the kind of thinking and planning that we can and should be doing now so that we can really take our time to identify the best way forward thank you and and finally I just want to say that I was really impressed with this discussion that you both approached at some point about looking forward and being prepared for Disease X that's going to come along I think that we are very fortunate no we're not we're not fortunate with what we're experiencing right now although I suspect it could be worse but this is pretty doggone bad and we have the smartest country in a whole wide world as far as I'm concerned there was amazing country in the whole wide world and we ought to be better positioned should there become and when there becomes another incident of this nature or anything close to it thank you I yield back thank you with you with the agreement of the ranking member what I would like to do is as I mentioned that we have members who could not be here so and I know that there are three members on our side of the aisle have had a question which I'd like to pose on their behalf and I don't think that's there any further questions that correct thank you okay so let me and I'll try to give you the the sense of the of the question a congressman mark Pocan of Wisconsin his question is in order to safely we open our communities experts like dr. Gottlieb of recommended being able to consistently test 1% of our population every week 50,000 that means in Wisconsin 50,000 tests per week do you feel that the federal government should play a role in helping States secure testing supplies so they can safely reopen what should we fed Ehrman do to take to ensure our communities have testing and the contact tracing capacity they need to safely address the pandemic are the guidelines from CDC on who should be prioritized accurate in your view are they missing anyone such as essential workers folks working at factory still or are first responders and I would add to that list I'm sure mark wouldn't mind because one of the questions I wanted to ask is about our folks who are in the meat and poultry poultry processing plants and the president is designating meat and poultry processing plants as essential infrastructure that must stay open now I don't know about everyone here sure maybe but I have been to both the poultry processing place and a meat processing place you just watch how those people are standing right next to each other as either chickens or beef just go by and so how do we deal with them as well so let me lay that one out yes I do think the federal government should play a role in obtaining testing supplies for the states what we don't want is a situation where all 50 states are having to devise their own strategies and bidding against each other and we really need a central coordinating function in order to make that run smoothly and I think the same largely goes for contact tracing in that the federal government plays an important role in issuing guidance and supporting state and local health department's in doing this work but our public health in the United States really does happen at the state and local level and so I do think it's appropriate that those functions be carried out at those levels the CDC testing priorities largely revolve around people who are hospitalized first and foremost with code like symptoms those with symptoms who don't require hospitalization health care workers and I do think those are appropriate testing priorities given our limited resources but that's not to say that people in these essential roles like those working in manufacturing and meatpacking facilities should not become essential it's just a matter of getting our testing capacity to the point that we are able to support that I would agree with all of that and just request that we issued a brief on exactly this question just two pages on who should be tested how many are in each group and what the level of prioritization is and if we can enter that integrally in close agreement with the CDC recommendation and you also have besides the the meat and poultry processing plants prisons have become now a place that we really need to look to thank you on behalf of our colleague Lucille roybal-allard this is about CDC authority and she talks about you dr. Frieden you have been the CDC has been an authoritative voice in the country to prevent the spread of infectious disease back in January February we were learning about the the novel coronavirus CDC leadership particularly dr. Mercer and dr. Redfield were present several days a week and testifying and hearings providing guidance however once the stay at home efforts began CDC became disturbingly absent and their visibility silent in their recommendations I mean just paraphrase to consider problematic that the the task force contained one CDC representative and for the most part the briefings are the last two months dr. Redfield was not invited to be part of the presentation given your own experience is it normal that CDC's not be more directive in response to the outbreaks and meat processing plants federal directives that these plants stay open even when they do not have protocols in place to protect workers should CDC be mandating the use of face masks and public venues insisting that face masks be made available to all individuals and during stores and other public places what role should CDC be playing in addressing this tragic epidemic of kovat in our nursing homes all about the CDC dr. Frieden but would you know first to say that CDC has 20,"000 health professionals who dedicate their lives to protecting Americans the National Center for immunization and respiratory disease has more than 700 FTE staff who are experts in this area they have spent decades working on the public health control of respiratory viruses doctor and shook at the principal deputy director was the former director of that Center in addition to being the principal deputy of CDC dr. B Sonia is the current director of that Center others in that Center are deeply experienced and deeply committed to this and many parts of CDC also have deep expertise in infection control for example in nursing home care CDC is is not does not have the authority to mandate CDC provides guidance but I will say that even as I am an infectious disease specialist I have spent 30 years on infectious disease control I've run two large public health agencies I would not take action without detailed input from the experts at CDC because they are the world talk top experts in this and I will feel safer when we're hearing from them regularly but I would also say that the American people have voted with their clicks because by this date CDC's website has had something like 1.4 billion clicks and it's still the best place to go for information advice guidance and recommendations to keep you your family your workplace your school your daycare safer and essentially what that would mean though if that's if you see cannot mandate we understand that but certainly I can imagine in New York time with regard to these meat and poultry processing plants that you worked closely with OSHA and with the USDA on these issues as well as state health department's to what to make these happens but you were in effect leading the way is the point that CDC took a major role in this effort and that is with the guidelines as well which is why I ask the question are we you can't mandate this but are we implementing everywhere in this country the CDC guidelines with responses to testing and I think the answer to that is no but in any case I don't know if you want to comment on the CDC piece doctor thank you okay and congresswoman Lois Frankel of Florida again this is similar to early testing is the key there's inconsistency on how much testing needs to be done hundreds of thousands and we are currently testing less than 200 give us again the benchmark for the number of tests we should be doing in this country ice know it start at 3.5 million per week and go up from there next week do we have the capacity to provide this not yet what will we have to do to achieve the capacity the steps aren't clear to me but I think that should be a priority who should determine two steps the federal government okay she has she asks based on your knowledge of the timeline of the of the of the response she talked about November US intelligence officials began warning of virus sweeping through Han region of China for more than 70 days from the first confirmed case in the US for the administration to take serious action based on your knowledge of the timeline of the response was there anything more that could have been done to contain the spread and also she points out that in May of 2018 of the administration disbanded the White House pandemic response team later received a report warning that the US has now prepared to respond to a severe influenza like pandemic do you have an opinion as to whether disbanding the pandemic response team was appropriate and that's was there anything more that could have been done okay this is exactly why we need a health defense operations appropriation so that whatever the status of the budget Americans can be safer because we have a stable source of funding to protect us from health threats at home or abroad just thinking about the first question it's always true in public health that we prefer prevention and it's easier to stay ahead of something than it is to regain control we have a lesson here in front of us now though as we are really in the midst of our pandemic that we need to be forward-looking and right yeah okay let me just say okay I'm going to ask a congressman Cole if he has some closing comments and then I will close thank you very much madam chair and I want to thank both our witnesses have been exceptionally helpful testimony and very forthright and compelling answers and I appreciate you both I want to thank you madam chair for holding this hearing as I did at the beginning I think it's a very important hearing to hold and you ask a lot of your members because this is the only reason why we're in town and I'm very pleased with all the members of the committee that we're able to come here and certainly very understanding of the ones that were not but but certainly took time to submit questions I thought I might win the the prize for coming for this but my friend Jaime Herrera Butler once more showed me up I think it's exceptional that you came with young children for this hearing and I think all of you need to be commended but I want to point out my my friend who came the furthest for for what she did there's a lot of good information this hearing and I think it really shows the reason why we need to be meeting as regularly as possible particularly on this issue I want to thank again both of you but dr. Frieden this idea of a health defense fund so to speak comparable to OCO I think is really bears considerable merit Sharon and I have talked about something like this have talked about the accounts that that you would want to have that we're not trying to open up the budget or crack the budget caps but look the defense budget in January 1 1942 was a lot different than it was in December 1 1941 I mean you have an intervening event a Pearl Harbor type event you have to relook at what you've planned and see if what's necessary to go forward and I think honestly spending billions to save trillions there's a no-brainer to me and I think that's where we're at we can never go through what we've gone through here before in terms of the disruption in the lives of the American people and in terms of the catastrophic costs imposed on the the federal treasury this is really the classics you know stitch in time saves nine kind of argument here and I think it's incontestable I think it's also clear that this is not and dr. Freda and I have talked about this before this is not a one-and-done supplemental type of problem we're gonna have to look at adjusting baselines going forward in light of the information that we have and not all those are in this committee when I talked about this to our Chairman we course focused on the CDC the NIH the strategic stockpile the infectious disease fund but as she quickly pointed out you know the food inspection network and the FDA neither of which are under our direct jurisdiction are also areas that you would want to look at and include so it's and I know I've talked to to our ranking member about this and to our staff about looking across all the the budget categories that might fit in and have some appropriate response to be in a system like dr. Frieden recommended I know too by just having this discussion madam chair it's already popped up on Politico so it shows the virtue of being at work in doing your business because I think it'll stimulate a discussion farther beyond here and I think it's a very important discussion for us to have we are going to be caught up we should be caught up and we are focused and dealing with the immediate problem that the coronavirus and I've been very proud of the Congress you know we have our differences of opinion and there's some some partisan elbows thrown here and there along the way fair enough but for supplementals in a row with essentially no partisan dissent I think is a pretty good indication that people are very very serious about this and are anxious to work together on this and can work together on this but while we respond to the immediate and we're going to be responding to it for some time yeah I think we got to build on the work that this committee has been engaged in for a number of years and a bipartisan way in a bicameral way with because it couldn't have happened without help from our good friends on the in the Senate and move toward you know some sort of more realistic and systemic systemic I should say program and systemic changes to a common so again and we build up the kind of capability and sustain it over time that we're gonna need I think that's gonna be the real judge the real test as to whether now we've learned the lessons I'm I'm not very I'm very understanding honestly if people caught up in a crisis that we probably couldn't envision literally 1617 weeks ago so you know there'll be valuable lessons to learn but again we've not had a lot of time to deal with this and so we're not going to get everything right where I would be more critical as if we lost the opportunity to make the basic changes we all know that we need to make and the basic investments that we need to make and both of you have laid those out for us to consider today so again thank you madam chair for what I thought was a very thoughtful and productive hearing I think all of my colleagues I thought every one of them had good and important points to make in question to ask and I look forward to to working with you madam chair and all our colleagues on this committee and the full Appropriations Committee to see that we and we draw the lessons and make the investments the American people need us to make going forward so that while we're going to deal with this not just in the short term but probably as both dr. rivers and dr. Frieden indicated in the intermediate term this isn't going away by the end of this year it's not going away by the in the next year it's gonna be with us for a considerable time until we can develop the therapeutics and the ultimately the vaccine to deal with it but it's taught us an important lesson that we ought to learn about the biosphere in general in terms of the number of challenges we've had quite a few in the last few years everything from czars to Zika to MERS Ebola and now this that ought to tell us this is just a fact of life we're gonna have to deal with and we're going to deal with it more effectively than we had and this hearing that you engineered madam chair has made that very apparent and I think it's very helpful to the Congress and beyond that the American people so with that thank you and I yield back thank you very very much I really this was the thought process on this was that especially with this subcommittee that we are at the center of the programming the the portfolio includes so many of the issues that we face in this in this pandemic and so I want to thank both of you for your willingness to be here this morning I don't know what kind of difficulty that was and in their own concerns or you know changing your lives but also your own concerns about your health and your safety and a particular thank you to my colleagues who have come from all over to be here today and you know Jamie traveled the farthest here so and that right I wish I could think about what he's a bottle of hand sanitizer Jay but it's a it's it's a testament to the to the interest and every single member on the committee that we spoke with wanted to be here and for one reason or another could not and that's why if the opening of my remarks I talked about these conversations are so critical to the health the safety and the economic health and safety of the country and we ought to be discussing those now in real time as we are putting together the the public policy the commitment of serious resources which is what we are what we are doing and we'll continue to try to do since we are working through now to think about where we go with the cares to package a couple of the you know the things that we have talked about I would just say I just say to my colleague dr. Harris I wrote down you know the education piece of this very very important but then I watch the news and I see I I see the beaches and I see people who are bright people smart people and it doesn't make any any difference and then I see honestly I see people in various places around the country storming the Bastille if you will storming into City Hall storming here and saying you know no you know that's not what we this is not what we should be doing as even with the education that's out there at the moment and what the scope of of the number of cases and with the scope of deaths I mean that in and of itself should make you pause to think about what your own behavior ought to be in this in this kind of a crisis what the issue of I also said at the outset of my comments yes the like that I I was or I am angry why and you've you've helped a lot here with can we get our arms around the testing and the federal government and its role as its role and laying that out for the states in that collaborative effort in in taking on the responsible because I see it at the federal level there was a New Orleans with Katrina a writer whose name was Michael Ignatieff he wrote a piece that it was when the levees broke he spoke about government as and citizens as their being a covenant and that when you reach a place where the circumstances in your life are in your environment are overwhelming where the challenges are so overwhelming that you cannot do something about it that's the role of the federal government to step in to take charge to make sure that we can build those bridges those pillars that can allow for us to move forward and went and he talked about when that levees broke the Covenant broke at that time well I think we have a very similar situation here the levees broke and the federal government is not at the center of the determination of how we gain control and go forward you all have written very substantial plans we asked about plans is there national plan etc the roadmap to reopening lays out very specifically the kinds of things we ought to do with phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and fourth phase is how we rebuild dr. Freiden you have laid out a roadmap of the agencies that can move us forward where we go in a forward way you know there going to be people looking backwards we want on this committee to look forward are the kinds of things that we can do to make sure that we can prevent this and I am asking you again I look it box it in test isolate find and treat and quarantine this is a road map and at the federal level what we ought to be doing is speaking with one voice and giving simple directions to our states to the agencies of our states and most of all to gain to regain the confidence of the American people and letting them know that how difficult this road is because again as I said earlier they're looking for the truth no matter how hard it is that's what I have always found you tell people straight give them the sense that while we do not have all the answers we do have a focus and a direction forward it's a safeguard themselves their families their health and loved ones and to safeguard their economic future and their economic security for the future so I can't thank you enough for doing this and I want you you've written it out you've laid it out we need to work very closely with it you need to keep speaking about this with the kind of standing that you all have we believe in doctors and researchers and scientists we believe in data that is the foundation on which we will need to build to regain control of this scourge which is what it is so I know you're not afraid but don't be afraid to speak out you have people who will listen want to work with you have you helped us get to where we want to go and with that this hearing is concluded thank you very very much you""""]""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,0,"Cruise ships kept sailing in the Caribbean, even as signs of sickness spread","As the coronavirus outbreak was spiraling into what became a pandemic and cruise ships began to report confirmed exposures, thousands of tourists continued to visit one of the most popular cruise destinations: the Caribbean. The $100 billion cruise industry transports some 30 million passengers around the world every year, an industry trade association said, with nearly a third of all cruise ships in the Caribbean. That’s a fraction of those who travel by air, a major factor in the spread of the virus. But public health experts said cruise ships create unique opportunities for infectious diseases to spread.Along with airplanes, cruise ships also played a role in the spread of the virus in the Caribbean, a region with small island populations and a fragile health-care system. While air travelers brought the first cases to islands such as St. Lucia and Cuba, cruise passengers were the first confirmed coronavirus patients in places such as the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico, according to local health officials. A Post analysis found that five ships — the Costa Favolosa, Costa Magica, Costa Luminosa, MS Braemar and MSC Meraviglia — made 18 stops in the Caribbean between Feb. 29 and March 11 while carrying someone who later tested positive for coronavirus. As of April 20, at least 145 crew members and 48 passengers who were aboard the Costa Luminosa have tested positive for the coronavirus. This is the story of how the Luminosa was able to continue sailing, even as signs of sickness spread. Read the story: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphi....

The $100-billion cruise industry transports some 30 million passengers around the world every year, an industry trade association said, with nearly a third of all cruise ships in the Caribbean. That\'s a fraction of those who travel by air, a major factor in the spread of the virus. But public-health experts said cruise ships create unique opportunities for infectious diseases to spread. In February and March of 2020, as cruise ships, some carrying ill passengers, sought to dock, the Caribbean faced difficult choices on whether to close ports to avoid the possibility of infections. Epidemiologists at Yale\'s Public School of Health modeled different scenarios of what could happen if a passenger infected by the novel coronavirus left a cruise ship and entered a port city where there were no previous cases. -Once we have three or five or seven infectious passengers leaving a ship, we believe that almost all of the time, we\'d see a sustained transmission in the port city. -The ""Washington Post"" mapped the travel of five passenger cruise ships in the Caribbean from February 20th to March 18th that transported someone who later tested positive for coronavirus. ♪♪ This is the story of one of those ships. The Costa Luminosa, operated by the Italy-based Costa Cruises, can carry up to 2,826 passengers and 1,050 crew members. ♪♪ On February 28th, the Costa Luminosa reached Ocho Rios, Jamaica, but Jamaican authorities refused to allow Italian passengers on the Costa Luminosa to disembark. The government had recently set up guidelines that banned passenger entry from countries with known outbreaks. -To now include Italy, South Korea, Singapore, and Iran. -Unable to unload passengers, the Luminosa left Jamaica and sailed on to George Town, the capital of the Cayman Islands. Upon arrival, a 68-year-old Italian man suffering a stroke was rushed from the docked ship to a hospital. He was left on the island after the ship departed later that day to undergo treatment. The Costa Luminosa finished the rest of the journey and arrived in Fort Lauderdale on March 5th, where some passengers left and the ship prepared for its next trip. In the early hours of the following day, it departed with new passengers but the same crew. -Bye! Going on the plank. -Jennifer Catrun was a passenger on that trip. She logged her experiences in daily videos. -So excited. Going on. -Activities on the ship were going on as usual at a time when Catrun said she was aware of the illness spreading in the world. -This is one of those times, March 7, 2020, just in case somebody\'s looking at this later on, in the midst of the coronavirus scare. -While the Costa Luminosa was sailing to San Juan, Puerto Rico, cruise-line executives and Jamaican government officials met in Miami to discuss guidelines for port entry to islands, Jamaican officials told the ""Post."" On March 8th, the Costa Luminosa docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico. -So pretty. So pretty, so pretty. -Along with other footage of the island, including scenes from a local gathering, Catrun filmed an ambulance leaving the Costa Luminosa. The president of this ambulance company is Carmen Cruz. -As soon as we get a call, we are on alert for symptoms associated with the pandemic, which in Puerto Rico, there still hadn\'t been a single case. -Cruz said the call came from a port agent in San Juan that dispatches requests from cruise ships. -They described it saying, no, that this was pneumonia, and she had a history of respiratory issues. But when they gave us the details that she was from Italy, had been on the ship for 16 days, we prepared ourselves as if it was a case of COVID-19. -Cruz said they were told that the passenger had shown symptoms for two days. A representative of the dispatcher said that the company facilitates communications between a ship\'s medical staff and the local hospital, but that those parties discuss the particulars of a medical case. -By 8:00 in the morning already all the crew and tourists had disembarked on the island to go shopping and take their normal trip without knowing that there was an infected person. We took the patient with her mask, which was the only thing she had on. The nurses on the cruise ship delivered the patient to us, and they did not have any type of protection. A hospital near the pier agreed to accept the patient. -Costa Cruises disputed the idea that ship officials had dismissed the possibility of the virus, saying that before the sick woman disembarked, the ship\'s doctor requested that she be tested for the coronavirus in Puerto Rico, even though the local hospital said it was not likely a COVID-19 case, according to the company. The couple remained in San Juan for care. The Costa Luminosa left the Caribbean the next day for a week-long journey across the Atlantic. -People are a little nervous about the COVID-19 panic that\'s going on throughout the world. Had messages on Cruise Critic this morning that someone was taken off the ship yesterday with respiratory illnesses. I don\'t think that\'s true. I saw the ambulance leaving. They were not even -- There was no masks on the people that were working. None of that was going on. -Remember the passenger that was dropped off in the Cayman Islands on the ship\'s previous voyage? Well, on March 12th, officials announced the coronavirus test results for five suspected cases, one of which was the Costa Luminosa passenger who had disembarked on February 29th. -The patient is a visitor who was transferred from a cruise ship for a critical cardiac issue. -By the time he was diagnosed with coronavirus, the country\'s first confirmed case, he had already unknowingly exposed more than 40 healthcare workers and their families, according to hospital officials. Six confirmed positive cases were tied to the passenger, officials said. The hospital was partially shut down for two weeks as it moved to contain the virus. Back on the Costa Luminosa, passengers were sent a letter, a copy of which was obtained by ""The Post,"" stating there were no suspected COVID-19 cases on board, but acknowledge that a passenger had been hospitalized in Puerto Rico. -And we got word last night that there was nobody on board that had suspected cases of the virus, and although there\'s a lot of people coughing on board, nobody has been severe enough to go into the infirmary. So that is a huge deal. -On March 13th, the Puerto Rican government announced the COVID-19 test results for the couple who had disembarked the Costa Luminosa on March 8th. -The results of the first cases that came under suspicion and were subject to the analysis just a few hours ago, we confirmed the first three positive coronavirus cases in Puerto Rico. -Passengers on the Costa Luminosa were told about the two confirmed cases the next day, on March 14th. Costa told ""The Post"" it learned of official results between March 14th and March 15, as they were at sea on the Atlantic. -We are on quarantine in our rooms. -After facing port closures and quarantines, the cruise line eventually canceled the rest of the trip and was able to evacuate more sick individuals in Spain\'s Canary Islands before disembarking passengers in France and Italy. Catrun got off the Costa Luminosa on March 19th and flew from France to Atlanta. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met the passengers at the airport and, after taking their temperatures, allowed them to fly back home. Catrun said she was ill as of April 16th with an unknown virus, but was not able to get a COVID-19 test because she does not have typical symptoms. Puerto Rico officials announced on March 21st that the Italian woman who was evacuated from the Costa Luminosa had passed away. -Our condolences to the family of this patient from Italy. -As of April 20th, at least 145 crew members and 48 passengers who were aboard the Luminosa had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Costa Cruises. Costa Cruises said it passed along information to passengers as soon as the ship received it and said that while the woman was still in the hospital, Luminosa officials isolated those who were in close contact with her and then took further measures when it got the result of her test. It also noted that company voluntarily paused all cruises on March 13th, the same day it said it received notice that the first passenger had tested positive. The Costa Luminosa wasn\'t the only ship that health officials tied to coronavirus cases. The Costa Favolosa left off passengers in three countries who officials said later tested positive -- 13 cases in the Dominican Republic, 52 in Trinidad and Tobago, and 2 in Martinique. A passengers on the British cruise ship MS Braemar traveling the Caribbean in the Americas disembarked on March 8th in Cartagena, Colombia, and was the city\'s first confirmed case, local health officials said. Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the owner of the Braemar, said the guest was not displaying any known COVID-19 symptoms at the time. [Indistinct speaking] In statements to ""The Post,"" cruise lines said they followed all international regulations to prevent the spread of disease and took voluntary measures, such as temperature checks and intensive sanitation measures. They disputed the idea that their ships brought the coronavirus into the region, saying that, while Caribbean residents who sailed on their ships have tested positive, there is not proof they contracted the virus on board. On April 16th, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald held a conference call with reporters and defended the company\'s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. -There was very little knowledge, you know, starting early on in fabulous and March and whatnot. We aggressively managed it, as we do any illness on board. -We spoke to the director of the Pan American Health Organization that helps countries in the Americas combat diseases about the burden a large-scale coronavirus outbreak would place on the region. -So, the very tiny ones, particularly those of the Eastern Caribbean -- they have limited capacities, limited number of healthcare workers, limited number of beds, limited number of the equipment that is necessary, particularly ventilators, et cetera. -The best way to protect a port city is to prevent any seeding events from taking place. -The Yale epidemiologists found to effectively prevent cruises from causing infections in port cities, cruise ships would need to prevent all passengers from disembarking once a single person is found to be symptomatic or infected. About a week before Donald\'s call, the CDC extended a nearly month-old No Sail Order for cruise ships in US waters for as long as 100 days. The CDC said that cruise-ship travel exacerbates the global spread of COVID-19 and that the pandemic had not been controlled sufficiently by the cruise-ship industry. ♪♪ ♪♪']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Build your custom website for 10% off by going\nto squarespace.com/wendover. China is a country both blessed and cursed\nby geography. On one hand its land has allowed the country\nto grow to almost 1.4 billion people but on the other hand it really doesn’t have great\ngeographical protection. The beginning of what most people call Chinese\nhistory often starts with the Yellow River Civilization and there’s a good reason why\nthis settlement grew into the most populous country in the world—the floodplain of the\nYellow River is some of the best agricultural land in the world. In fact, the entirety of eastern China is\nperfectly suited for Agriculture. This was and still is crucial to the country’s\nsuccess. What’s more, this area is just warm and\nwet enough that farmers can do what is know as double-cropping. Once the main crop of rice is cultivated in\nJune and July, another slightly less productive crop can be planted for October cultivation. This increases rice output by about 25% which\nmeans China can make more food using the same amount of land. Europe mostly relies on wheat to feed its\npopulation which only outputs 4 million calories of food per acre of farmland. Rice, on the other hand, grows 11 million\ncalories worth per acre. It’s easy to see why there are so many people\nin China. But China does have its geographical challenges. To the south it borders three countries—Vietnam,\nLaos, and Myanmar. The borders between these three countries\nand China seem almost arbitrarily set because they sort of were. Vietnam’s was set after the Sino-French\nWar, Laos’ was set following its involvement in the Vietnam war, and Myanmar’s was set\nfollowing a small war with China in the 60s. None was naturally set by the environment;\nall were chosen arbitrarily by humans at war. These countries are not insignificant—combined\nthey have nearly one million active military personnel while China, the much larger country,\nhas just over two million. Significant conflict with any of these countries\nwould not be a one-sided war. While China would have the technological advantage,\nany of these three countries would have a significant home-field advantage. Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar are all jungle\ncountries—one of the most difficult environments for warfare. This was part of the reason why the Vietnam\nwar lasted so long. It’s just so hard to move troops in the\njungle so everything slows down. Without any geographical protection of its\nborders it would be significantly easier for Vietnam, Laos, or Myanmar to invade China\nthan the reverse. But China does have an advantage elsewhere. China and India just aren’t good friends. They have border disputes, military conflicts,\npolitical differences, so its just hard for them to get along and that is why Tibet is\nso important. Tibet was historically its own empire; it\nwas only in the last 300 years that China took it over. Tibetan people are ethnically different from\nthe Han Chinese inhabiting China’s east. It just doesn’t make sense for Tibet to\nbe part of China… except militarily. Only 0.2% of China’s population lives in\nTibet which accounts nearly 13% of the country’s area. More people live in the inner four districts\nof Beijing than the entirety of Tibet. It’s just incredibly desolate, but it serves\na purpose. If China didn’t rule Tibet, then India would. Maybe not formally, but there’s little chance\nthat an independent Tibet would not be economically and culturally dominated by either India or\nChina. It just doesn’t have enough power economically\nor militarily to resist, but in China’s view, it could not and cannot allow for an\nIndian Tibet. Indian rule of Tibet would mean that there\nwould be no geographical protection between the populated area of China and India because\nTibet is that geographical protection. Not only does Tibet extend China’s border\nto the Himalayas, it’s also an unpopulated area without the transportation infrastructure\nneeded for an invading India to advance a large number of troops towards eastern China. But that also means that there’s not the\ntransportation infrastructure necessary for China to advance towards India, but China\nis trying to change that. They recently opened the worlds highest railroad\nto Tibet, they’re building highways constantly, and they also opened a large airport in Nyingchi\njust miles away from the border. In the near term the goal of these projects\nis to further integrate Tibet into China. The government has all but failed at winning\nover the native Tibetan population, but they can change who lives in Tibet. Hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese have\nmoved into Tibet and many more visit each year. The government knows that Tibet’s usefulness\nis diminished if when a foreign military shows up the population thinks that means liberation\nrather than invasion. But there’s another reason why China needs\nTibet—water. That whole eastern zone of agricultural productivity\nexists because of all the water from Tibet. The Yellow and Yangtze Rivers—China’s\ntwo longest rivers—both get their water from Tibet and foreign control of the water\nsupply of the country would, in the governments mind, strike a catastrophic blow to the country’s\nfood security. If there were, hypothetically, a significant\nmountain range separating Tibet from eastern China, there’s a good chance it would still\nbe independent. The water would still come from China and\nthe mountains would act as the geographical protection that China desires. But to the North is another one of China’s\nassets—Mongolia. It’s an enormous, sparsely populated, friendly\ncountry. With the gobi desert and other desolate terrain,\nthere’s just little chance that any modern land-based army could make it across with\nany efficiency. The supply lines would be enormously long\nand by the time they got to the Chinese border there would have been ample warning. But then again, who would want to invade? Mongolia’s only other neighbor is Russia\nwhich is a friendly ally of China both militarily and economically. China need not worry about its northern border\nuntil relations with Russia sour. But that leaves the eastern border. Now, you would think that this would be China’s\nsafest border—the ocean—but you have to consider that powerful states lay just off\nChina’s shores, the most powerful one being the US. The United States has a significant Pacific\nmilitary presence with bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam. It’s also a close ally with Taiwan, Indonesia,\nSingapore, and Malaysia meaning that, if a serious dispute with China occurred, the US\nwould have no problem blockading China and cutting off its maritime access, and of course,\nChina knows this. That’s why China has spent so much time,\nenergy, and political capital to establish sovereignty in the South China Sea by building\nmilitary bases and artificial islands. It knows that it needs these islands so it\nhas sovereignty over the area so that it can reach the Pacific in case of war, but ironically,\nits actions in the area are souring its relations with the very nations that China needs on\nits side. The Philippines, for example, doesn’t have\na bulletproof relationship with the US. While the two countries are allies, Philippine\nleadership has attempted to distance themselves from the US. If China hadn’t ruined its relationship\nwith the Philippines over the South China Sea dispute it could’ve won them to their\nside which would allow China crucial access to the Pacific if the US attempted a naval\nblockade. China’s entire economy relies on exports\nso restrictions to access to the oceans would lead to economic ruin. With its enormous population, China also relies\non the importation of food, most of which comes on ships. Without jobs or food, there’s a good chance\nthat the population would rise up against the government and end the current regime. China didn’t want to be a global power spreading\nits influence to every continent until recently. It wanted to be the the dominant power in\nits region, Asia, but historically it kept its affairs within the region. It never colonized outside of Asia and for\nmuch of history it didn’t have a significant navy to project its power around the world. But that has changed just because China got\nso big. China is now of a size where it cannot support\nits population with its size alone. Self-sufficiency in food production has been\na major aspect of China’s domestic policy for decades, but the country has found a way\nto move past that as its economy has grown. Africa has emerged almost as China’s China. It supplies the country that supplies the\nworld. China has pumped enormous amounts of money\ninto the continent in what some describe as a form of neocolonialism. Chinese state-backed corporations have bought\nhuge amounts of land in Africa to mine minerals, drill for oil, and grow food. China now imports more food and oil than it\nexports. While that is a sign of the development of\nits economy, it also means that it is now reliant on foreign powers which is a vulnerable\nposition for a country that is often at odds with some of those foreign powers. China doesn’t have bad geography, it has\nsome of the best in the world which has allowed for it to grow into the largest country in\nthe world, but as it grows into a more and more powerful and developed country, it needs\nto be cognizant of its vulnerabilities if the current regime wishes to continue. It’s clear that because of its geography,\nthe country is in a more precarious position than some may think. If there were every a reason to go to war\nwith China, the country is surrounded to the south and east by countries that would likely\nside with NATO powers. To the west and north, China is surrounded\nby countries and regions without the infrastructure to support China is a war. China is a nuclear power which means formal\nwar with other superpowers is unlikely, but, if it ever were to happen, its hard to deny\nthat its major disadvantage is geography.

For just $12 a year, get access to both Curiosity\nStream and Nebula—home to our brand-new hour-long documentary called the Final Years\nof Majuro. Out of the myriad problems that emerged in\nthe world in Spring 2020, there is one that is quietly being solved—one that has to\ndo with the behind-the-scenes of a globalized, modern-day economy. Understanding it is easy. At its core, it’s a simple supply and demand\nmismatch. You see, back in March 2020, when COVID-19\nreached pandemic status, almost every airline in the world drastically scaled back its flying. It varied from region to region and airline\nto airline, but the common trend everywhere was that, if any route got cut, it was almost\ncertainly a long-haul one. In the era of quarantine periods, border closings,\nand other travel restrictions, there is near-zero demand for long-haul, international travel,\nso intercontinental flights were quickly removed from airline schedules. For example, in April 2019, about 500 roundtrip\nflights per day would fly between Europe and the US, however, in April 2020, that number\nwas reduced to about 80 per day. That represents between an 80% and 90% reduction. Ignoring airline revenue, you’d think that\nthat would be a loss-free situation, though: it reduces carbon emissions, many governments\nare covering the salaries of furloughed workers, it reduces airline expenditure, and nobody’s\nriding in the cabins anyways, but that doesn’t consider what rides below the cabin. On nearly every intercontinental flight, in\nthe belly hold, among the hundreds of passenger bags, there is cargo. In fact, 45% of the world’s air cargo is\ncarried in this method. Now, the math to explain the supply and demand\nmismatch is simple. The proportion of cargo carried on passenger\naircraft varies from route to route, so 60% of Western Europe to US air cargo, for example,\nflies on passenger planes. 80% to 90% of transatlantic passenger flights\nare not flying, which means that about 50% of air cargo capacity in this market has disappeared\nin a matter of weeks. The situation is less severe in other markets,\nbut, industry-wide, the overall air cargo capacity reduction was about 23% in March,\n2020. So that’s the supply figure, but what about\ndemand? As a huge proportion of the world entered\nvarious lockdown scenarios, economic forecasts plummeted. The extent of the financial toll will not\nbe clear for a while, but it is clear that it is deeply negative. This all has an effect on air cargo demand. On a macro level, consumers are buying less,\nwhich means less is shipped, which means companies are buying less, which means less is shipped,\nwhich means suppliers are making less, which means less is shipped. On a micro level, different jurisdictions\nworldwide differ on the exact details of their Coronavirus response, but in many places,\nfactories are shut down which means supply chains are cut. So, from an economic perspective, one would\npredict that demand would almost certainly be down, but like all things in the age of\nCoronavirus, there is another dominant perspective—that of public health. From almost the moment COVID-19 emerged, it\nbecame clear that it was a highly infectious virus, which means that a crucial component\nof the safe treatment of an infected individual is the use of personal protective equipment,\nor PPE. In this context, that means, masks, shields,\ngowns, and more, which healthcare facilities always stock, but never in the quantity needed\nto cover nearly universal staff usage for a long period. That means that, in order to reduce the risk\nof staff exposure, nearly every hospital in the world needed more PPE. Purely by chance, it turns out that the number\none medical PPE producing country in the world was also the first country to experience COVID-19—China. Before the pandemic, the country produced\n20 million medical masks per day, or about half of the world’s supply. By the beginning of March, though, this had\nalready been scaled up to more than 100 million per day. It was at exactly this time when, simultaneously,\nChina’s manufacturing industry started to inch back to life and the virus truly took\nhold of the rest of the world. With how fast COVID-19 ramped up, many hospitals\nin hotspots like Italy, Spain, and the US were reusing masks and, even with that technique,\nwere down to only days of supply, so they needed supply from China, and other manufacturing\nhubs, as fast as possible. In the logistics world, “as fast as possible,”\nmeans air cargo. Thanks to this unprecedented and urgent demand\nfor PPE and other medical supplies, demand for air cargo only dropped by 15% in March,\n2020. Considering air cargo capacity dropped by\n23%, that means that there was an 8% gap between supply and demand. In the context of this enormous industry,\n8% is huge, and so the laws of supply and demand followed their course. The cost to transport goods by air spiked,\nespecially in the crucial Asia to US and Europe markets. In the last two weeks of March, air cargo\nrates from Hong Kong to North America jumped 27% above normal, while rates from Shanghai\nto Europe increased by 50%. Of course, after a supply and demand mismatch\neconomic forces push companies to increase supply, which is exactly what happened. Cargo airlines that could massively ramped\nup their flights. Kalitta Air, for example, an American cargo\nairline, brought some aircraft out of storage and increased its long-haul flying by nearly\n50%. However, there is only so much that these\ncargo airlines can do. They only have so many aircraft, so many pilots,\nand so many mechanics so they can’t massively ramp up their operations in a short time. Who did have extra capacity, though, were\npassenger airlines, and that’s where a small solution emerged. A plane with no passengers is not necessarily\nan empty plane. An average airline earns 15% to 20% of its\nrevenue through cargo, but keep in mind what an average airline looks like. Most of the average North American airlines’\nflying is domestic and short-haul, where little cargo is carried, so the proportion of revenue\ncoming from cargo on a long-haul flight is far higher. Consider too that, on a normal long-haul passenger\nflight, a considerable portion of the cargo hold is filled with baggage so that 15 to\n20% is derived from only some of the capacity on only some flights. Airlines soon realized that there was a possibility\nof turning a profit flying a passenger plane with no passengers. Now, normally, a passenger a330, for example,\nhas capacity for 38 thousand pounds or 17 thousand kilograms of cargo in its belly hold. That’s compared to the freighter version\nof the a330 which can carry 132 thousand pounds or 60 thousand kilograms of freight thanks\nto its completely empty cabin. That means that the passenger a330 can only\ncarry 29% as much cargo as its freighter counterpart. However, considering that freight rates have\nrisen by as much as 50%, that means that flying these aircraft can earn about 44% as much\nper flight as their freighter counterparts normally do. Making less than half as much as cargo airlines\nclearly would not make flying passenger aircraft for cargo purposes worth it, but there is\nmore to consider. First, jet fuel prices are at an all-time\nlow, largely in response to all-time low demand. The same gallon that would have cost airlines\n$2.20 in January, 2020 costs about 40 cents in late-April, 2020, and those prices are\ncontinuing to drop. In normal conditions, fuel is airlines’\nnumber one cost so having that drop by a factor of five reduces the cost to operate a flight\ndramatically. That means that they need to earn far less\nthan what a cargo airline does in normal conditions to break-even. In addition, most airlines are paying their\npilots and other staff anyways. In the US, for example, airlines are required,\nas a condition of their government relief funding, to not lay off or furlough any staff,\nso the marginal staffing cost to operate an additional flight is minimal. Thirdly, with no passengers, airlines have\nquickly innovated new ways to carry cargo. Many airlines have loaded their passenger\ncabins with cargo placed directly on top of and fastened to seats. This dramatically increases complexity and\nloading time, but it also dramatically increases capacity. All of these conditions and circumstances\ncombine to the point that, for this brief moment in time, economics dictate that an\nairline can turn a profit flying a passenger plane without passengers. Big airlines like American Airlines, Air Canada,\nLufthansa, and Air New Zealand began cargo-only flights—so many, in fact, that United airlines,\nfor example, had up to dozens of passenger-less passenger planes airborne at the same time\nall around the world. This also created flights that have never\nhappened before, like a 16-hour nonstop cargo-only trip from Sydney to Toronto by Air Canada. But it wasn’t all just big airlines on long\nflights. Smaller airlines too got in on the game. Air Greenland started a link on a tiny propeller\nDash-8 to transport Coronavirus tests for processing in a Danish lab, Titan airways\nflew medical supplies to the remote island of St Helena on a passenger a318, and Wizz\nAir flew their passenger a321’s to Shanghai via Kazakstan to transport medical supplies\nto Hungary. These circumstances have also led to a dramatic\nreshuffling of rank and order in the aviation world. The list of the world’s busiest airports,\nin terms of annual aircraft movements, is normally headed by Atlanta, followed by Chicago,\nLos Angeles, Dallas, Beijing, and a number of other major hub airports. Normally, you wouldn’t expect an airport\nfrom America’s third least populous state anywhere on the first pages of that list,\nhowever, for a brief moment in April, 2020, that was the case. Anchorage airport, in Alaska, became the world’s\nbusiest airport thanks to its strategic location. It has long been a busy cargo airport as it\nacts as stopover point for cargo flights from Asia to North America. They stop here because it is more efficient\nfor aircraft, on long-haul flights, to take less fuel and more cargo and refuel halfway\nthrough than fly nonstop to their destination. Also, in some cases, freight is sorted and\nexchanged between aircraft in Anchorage. In April 2020, the US ranked number one in\nthe world for new and total Coronavirus cases, so it had a tremendous need for medical supplies,\nwhich are overwhelmingly produced in Asia, so hundreds of cargo aircraft per day passed\nthrough Anchorage on their way between Asia and the US. So, while every other major airport in the\nUS fell into relative silence, Anchorage was busier than ever. There is, however, one final issue that the\nair cargo world is facing. Beyond the short-term issue of too much demand,\nthe long-term issue is that this demand will not last. Global air cargo demand closely tracks with\nglobal economic health. Every indicator suggests that the economy\nwill not emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even close to as strong as when it entered,\nso there will undoubtably be some slow months and years for air cargo. Once urgent demand for medical supplies eases,\nand buyers have the time to switch to slower forms of shipping, the air cargo world will\nalmost certainly follow the fate of its passenger-carrying colleagues. On the exact same day as this video goes out,\nwe released a brand-new, hour-long documentary called, “The Final Years of Majuro.” It’s about the isolated nation of the Marshall\nIslands and, specifically, what life is like when you know your nation is coming to an\nend—when where you live has an expiration date.

The first 100 people to sign up using the\nlink in the description get three free delicious, fresh meals from Blue Apron. In 2004 the American Highway Users Alliance\npublished an article claiming that the Katy freeway in Houston, Texas was the second most\ncongested road in America. Drivers spent a combined 25.4 million hours\nevery year sitting in traffic on that road. That’s 36 lifetimes worth. It was an absolute embarrassment of a road\nfor Texas so they decided to spend $2.8 billion to expand it to 28 lanes making it the widest\nhighway in the world. All this extra capacity would surely fix the\nproblem—more lanes means more room for more cars which means shorter travel times... right? Unfortunately not. Between 2011 and 2014 alone, travel times\non the Katy freeway increased by up to 55%. It now takes an average of 64 minutes to drive\nthe 28 miles between downtown Houston and Katyland during the afternoon rush hour. That’s up from 41 minutes in 2011. The problem with this project was that the\nsolution violated the fundamental law of road congestion—more lanes mean more traffic. This probably seems counterintuitive. The more lanes there are the higher the capacity\na road has so cars should be able to drive faster... but that’s a very narrow analysis\nof the problem. You can’t just think about how this would\nwork on one road, you have to think about it in the context of a whole city. Many people choose not to drive places because\nof how long it takes. If the traffic is bad, they can take public\ntransit or wait until a less busy time, or just not travel at all. When a road is expanded, travel times initially\ndecrease so all those people who chose not to drive or to take an alternate route or\nwhatever decide to switch to using that newly expanded road. What’s fascinating about roads is that this\nhappens at a perfect 1 to 1 ratio. If the capacity of a road doubles, the amount\nof people using that road will also double. If it doubles again, the amount will again\ndouble. Of course if you kept doing this over and\nover again you would eventually build a big enough road that there wouldn’t be any more\ncars to fill the road, but in the real world where demand for roads far outstrips supply,\ndrivers will adjust to any change in road capacity. So does that mean that it’s hopeless? Is there no way to solve traffic? No way to make our roads better and safer\nand more efficient? Well... no. There’s plenty we can do. Here’s the thing about traffic—it slows\ndown exponentially. The 20,000 car on the road slows down traffic\noverall significantly more than the 5,000 car. This is a major driver for a lot of jams—a\nsmall addition of cars leads to a large addition in congestion—but it also makes solving\ntraffic a bit easier since you only need to remove a small amount of cars from the road\nand that’s just what ramp meters do. Ramp meters are set up on the on-ramps of\nhighways to restrict the amount of people getting on the highway. They usually let one car on every five or\nsix seconds. Since the amount of cars actually on the highway\nis kept down, the highway stays at its most efficient speed. Minnesota did an experiment where they shut\ndown their long-used ramp meters for eight weeks in order to see if they actually worked\nand they found that the highway capacity decreased by 9%, travel times increased by 22%, speeds\ndropped by 7%, and crashes increased by 26%. Stockholm, Sweden used that exponential nature\nof traffic to decrease travel times by up to 40% in 2006. Stockholm as a city lies across 14 islands\nwhich means that all the bridges act as huge chokepoints. Traffic, therefore, was historically horrible\nfor the relatively small city. On January 3rd, 2006, Stockholm started to\ncharge drivers who entered this central perimeter—the busiest area. The charge wasn’t much—between 10 and\n20 krona, the equivalent of 1 and 2 US dollars— but it was enough to persuade 20% of drivers\nto not enter the central perimeter. They either went downtown on public transport\nor walked or didn’t go at all. These are the amounts of daily drivers in\nthe perimeter in the years leading up to the charge. As soon as the charge was implemented in 2006,\nthe daily amount dropped down to here. It wasn’t a fluke. After the 6 month initial trial period driving\nin the central core became free again and the amount of daily drivers increased to nearly\nthe level it was before. When the charge became permanent in 2007,\ndaily numbers once again plummeted. Even though the charge was minuscule, it was\nenough to dissuade 10s of thousands of people from using those roads. There are really two costs of driving—the\nmoney and the time. When the time it takes to drive isn’t enough\nof a cost to prevent people from driving, these charges increase the overall cost to\na level where some people will decide not to drive. But what about safety? Roads are still unbelievably dangerous. In any given year, 1 out of every 10,000 people\nin the US die in a car accident. Just think about how high of a proportion\nthat is. If you go to a Redskins game at FedEx field\nnear Washington, DC, eight of the people sitting in the stands with you will die in the next\nyear in a car accident. It turns out one of the best ways to prevent\naccidents is with something you’ve almost certainly already seen or used—the roundabout. There’s a reason you see these more and\nmore. Roundabouts reduce deaths and serious injuries\nby 90%. That is not an error. With roundabouts, there’s almost no opportunity\nfor the worst type of collision—the head on full speed crash. In a traditional intersection, cars come within\nfeet of each other while going at a relative speed of up to 100 mph. A head-on crash at that speed is undoubtedly\ncatastrophic. With roundabouts, cars naturally slow down\nto about 15-25 miles per hour since they’re going around a curve. Also, if there were to be a collision, it\nwould either be a side-impact collision if a car failed to turn into the circle or a\nside-to-side collision if a car misjudged the curve. Both of these collisions happen at a low relative\nspeed so fatalities are low. But what about capacity? Surely the lower-speed roundabouts cause horrible\ntraffic problems. Well... they don’t. A single lane roundabout can handle a maximum\nof 1800 vehicles per hour which is exactly the same as a traditional two-lane signaled\nintersection. While cars will move through a signaled intersection\nat a much higher speed, they have to wait both for the light to change and left-turning\ncars. With roundabouts, you have a smooth, consistent,\nalbeit slower, flow. So what’s the problem? Why haven’t we replaced every intersection\nwith a roundabout? Well there are disadvantages—they’re more\ndifficult for pedestrians, especially those who are deaf or blind, they require a larger\nfootprint, they’re more expensive to maintain—but the real reason roundabouts are not ubiquitous\nnowadays is because of the biggest fallacy in road design—that drivers need rules. Poynton, just outside of Manchester, UK, used\nto have a typical, rather dreary intersection and nobody really liked it. Cars would back up for miles, pedestrians\nhad to wait forever for the light to change, and it essentially split the town apart. So someone had the idea to remove the traffic\nlights, remove the zebra crossings, the curbs, remove almost every safety device in the intersection\nand just set up two adjoining roundabouts. Surely this would wreak havoc, but it didn’t. Turns out, when people are uncomfortable,\nwhen people aren’t really sure what’s going on, they pay more attention. The green light was a signal to people that\nthe road was clear, that it was safe to speed, that they could let their guard down, but\nafter the change the cars were able to flow freely, albeit at a slow pace, instead of\nwaiting for the lights to change. Pedestrian incidents went down, collisions\nwent down, traffic flowed faster, and the city center finally had some character. So, all around the world cities are replicating\nwhat Poynton did. They’re removing curbs, traffic lights,\nand pedestrian crossings to make one shared space. All around the world, these streets are resulting\nin fewer accidents and more pedestrian space. Discomfort is saving lives. On a larger scale, there’s one more innovative\nintersection design that’s beginning to save lives—the diverging diamond interchange. This interchange is designed as a way to get\nmore cars on and off highways faster. After the on-ramp to the right side, the road\ncrosses over so cars never have to traverse active lanes to get onto the highway. A car heading north can effortlessly join\nthe on-ramp without crossing traffic, and a car heading south will cross over so it\ndrives on the left side and can effortlessly join the on-ramp to head south. Not only is this easier for drivers, it improves\nsafety. The dangerousness of an intersection is often\nrated by determining the number of conflict points—possible points where accidents could\nhappen under normal circumstances. With a traditional on-ramp intersection there\nare 26. With a diverging diamond intersection, only\n14. And they’re faster too. The US Department of Transportation found\nin a study that universally, whether the traffic was light or heavy, diverging diamond interchanges\nlet more cars through faster. It costs less too. A traditional on-ramp intersection requires\n$11.3 million to build; a diverging diamond intersection, only $5.7 million. There are really no major disadvantages to\nthis intersection so nearly 100 of them have been built to date and more and more are being\ninstalled each month. As good as these solutions sound, there’s\nno one way to solve traffic. The difference between cities with chronic\ntraffic problems and those without is a combination of smart policies and designs that mitigate\nthe effects of having more road demand than supply. But traffic won’t just fix itself so until\ncities at least experiment with solutions we’re all condemned to traffic, forever. This video was made possible by Blue Apron.

Make your next move with a beautiful website\nfrom Squarespace. The Cumberland valley is home to six towns\nlying between Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania— Greencastle, Chambersburg,\nShippensburg, Newville, Carlisle, and Mecanicsburg. What’s exceptional about these small Pennsylvania\ntowns is that they’re each almost exactly 10 miles from each other. The distances deviate by no more than a mile\nfrom this rule. This isn’t a coincidence and this isn’t\nplanned. Drawing equal sized radii around each town\nshows you their spheres of influence. Assuming each town has the exact same shops\nand services, rational people will just go to whichever town is closest to buy or sell\ngoods. Towns ten miles apart mean that nobody has\nto travel more than five miles to reach a town. Each one of these towns was founded before\nthe formation of the United States, so that means that, of course, nobody had cars and\npretty much everybody walked everywhere. 10 miles, or 5 miles each way, is about the\ndistance a person can comfortably walk in a day with enough time to buy or sell goods\nat a central market. Back in this era before cars, a 5 mile radius\nwas essentially the largest possible commuter zone to small agricultural towns and therefore\nhaving towns ten miles apart was the most efficient possible use of rural land. When you get a chance, take a look at map\nof a rural area that existed before cars. You’ll see that the distance between medium-sized\ntowns is almost always somewhere between about 10 to 15 miles. Because the Cumberland valley is a valley,\ntowns really could only develop in a line, but in most cases towns develop in all directions. This is what the ten mile rule looks like\ngoing out in all directions. Each of these points is a town and the hexagon\naround it is the area from which people will go to the town. In the real world, each of these towns probably\nhas a small grocery store, a pharmacy, a bank, and maybe a restaurant. Since everybody uses these services, there\ndoesn’t have to be many people in a towns sphere of influence in order to sustain these\nshops. But where do you put something more specialized,\nlike a mechanic. People only need to go the mechanic every\nonce in a while so you need more people to sustain one mechanics shop than one grocery\nstore. Well, some of these small towns develop into\nlarger towns with more people that can support more specialized shops and services. Putting these larger towns with more specialized\nshops closer together would be unsustainable since there wouldn’t be enough people going\nto those shops but putting them farther apart would be inefficient since there’s land\nthat people would not go to a city from. This happens once or twice more until you\nhave cities. These cities have the largest spheres of influence\nand the most specialized shops. You of course still have grocery stores and\npharmacies in cities, but you also have things like luxury car dealerships, brain surgery\ncenters, and airports. The city’s sphere of influence is enormous\nbecause people will travel hundreds of miles to buy an expensive car or get brain surgery\nor fly from an airport. Think about it within a city. How far would you walk to buy a latte. Probably only a few blocks and that’s why\nyou see Starbucks or other coffee shops on almost every block. Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only\nneed a few blocks of people to sustain one coffee shop. But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook? Probably quite far since its a infrequent\nand substantial purchase. That’s why Apple stores are rather rare\neven in cities. You need an enormous amount of people to sustain\none Apple store and we can actually figure out roughly how many. In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is\nabout 20 miles away from the New Haven store to the north-east and the Stamford store to\nthe south-west. In the 10 mile radius around the Trumbull\nApple Store there are about half a million inhabitants which tells us that you need about\nhalf a million people to sustain one Apple store. We can compare that to the Starbucks’ of\nlower Manhattan which are spread out at an average distance of about 600 feet. Drawing a 300 foot radius around one Starbucks\nin lower Manhattan covers around 6,000 people which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000\npeople to sustain it. Of course both Connecticut and New York are\nplaces with higher than average incomes which means less people are needed to sustain one\nStarbucks or Apple Store. The numbers would be very different in, say,\nrural Kansas, but since each store generally only builds in areas with higher-than-average\nincomes this gives a good sense of how many people Apple and Starbucks looks for in an\narea before opening up a store. So, our model shows where cities should be,\nbut its not like this in reality. This is the most efficient spread of cities\nif you’re assuming that the cities are on a perfectly flat plane with no geographic\nfeatures, no social influences, no variability of income, equal distribution of resources—essentially\nassuming the world is one homogeneous place… which its not. In reality, of course, our world has an enormous\neffect on where and why cities develop. To start out, let’s cut this down to one\ncity on a flat, featureless plane for simplicity. What affects the location of cities more than\nanything is water. If we put an ocean on one side of our isotropic\nplane, our city will almost certainly locate near it. Oceans have always been and still are what\nconnects the world. There’s no other means of transport that\ncan move such enormous amounts of cargo for so little. Any city needs to be economically efficient\nto grow and it will cost more to bring goods to a city that’s 1000 miles inland than\none right by the ocean. Just look at Europe. 6 of the 10 largest European cities are within\n100 miles of the coast. But oceans aren’t the only bodies of water\nto affect cities. Rivers are just as or perhaps even more influential. Milan, the 19th largest European city, is\nthe largest to not be either directly on the ocean or on a river, and even then its only\n15 miles from a river and 75 miles from the ocean. Until the last century or so, cities could\nnot survive without direct water access. If you need more proof, 14 of the 15 largest\ncities in the world are within a few dozen miles of the ocean. Perhaps the most obvious attractor for cities\nis resources, so going back to our isotropic plane, putting natural resources anywhere\non this map will draw cities near it. Cities that existed before the last century\nor so generally sprung up right near the resources, much like Pittsburgh, since they acted as\nmanufacturing and transportation hubs for those resources, but more recently new resource\ndependent cities don’t need to be as close to the resources themselves. New transportation technologies can bring\nthe resources from their source. Just look at Dubai. Of course the UAE has enormous oil deposits,\nbut they’re much closer to Abu Dhabi and the South-West than Dubai. In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 residents, less\nthan half that of Carlisle, Pennsylvania—one of the farming towns we talked about at the\nbeginning. That only grew to 40,000 by 1960, but today\nits known worldwide and has more than 2.5 million residents. It was able to grow at this enormous rate—even\nfaster than Abu Dhabi—since it cemented itself as the economic and administrative\nhub for the oil industries of the region. Another geographic feature that we can add\nto the plane is mountains. Now, mountains don’t always have a uniform\naffect on cities. Mexico City, Bogota, and Addis Ababa are all\nenormous cities at elevations above 7,000 feet. Mountains do make transport and trade difficult,\nbut they also provide protection. Many ancient cities grew in these locations\nsince they were easy to protect, which left more time to focus on growing the city, but\nmountains can also hinder development. For quite a while, the United States could\nnot develop west of the Appalachian mountains. They just served as an enormous barrier. In 1800, the average center of population\nfor the entire United States was here even though the US had sovereignty over this entire\narea. Of course technology eventually conquered\nthis barrier and moved the mean population center all the way out to Missouri today,\nbut if the Appalachian mountains didn’t exist American history and geography would\nbe completely different. We would have seen urban development much\nearlier in the mid-west. But mountains can have another effect. You see, coal, silver, gold, and other mineral\ndeposits are all often located in mountainous regions, and, just like Dubai, cities can\ndevelop in less hospitable and easy places due to resources. The economic advantage of exploiting the resources\noverpowers the economic disadvantage of being in an inhospitable location. Denver, Colorado grew 650% between 1870 and\n1880 with the opening of a railroad branch connecting with the transcontinental railroad. It served as an access point to transportation\nto the gold miners in the rockies. So mountains can either push cities away or\nbring them nearer—it really just depends on the circumstance. Let’s exchange our isotropic plane for a\nworld map. Where should cities be on here? Well, our world’s cities are not necessarily\nall in the most geographically efficient locations. While there is a certain level of natural\nselection that grows the efficiently placed cities and shrinks the inefficiently placed\ncities, humans are not always able to put cities in the most efficient locations. Let’s put up the 224 cities in the world\nwith a population over 2 million. You can immediately see some patterns. Putting up the equator, you can see a clear\ndivide. Only 32 of these cities lie in the southern\nhemisphere. One might think this is because there is so\nmuch more land in the northern hemisphere, but that’s not entirely true. You see, the southern hemisphere still has\n32% of the world’s land, but only has 14% of the world’s large cities. There’s clearly a higher density of cities\nin the northern hemisphere. You can pretty much trace this all back to\nEurope and Asia. The first large civilizations and empires\nwere on these two continents even though the human race likely originated in Africa. There’s hundreds of different theories on\nwhy civilizations succeeded in some places and failed in others, but one of the more\nplausible and interesting theories is that Europe and Asia succeeded because they’re\nwide instead of tall. The very shape of the continents may have\nchanged the course of human history. You see, when a continent is wide, you have\na ton of land with roughly the same climate. Climate tends to change when you go north\nand south rather than east and west as a nature of how the earth rotates around the sun. Much of the success of early civilizations\nhad to do with the domestication of plants and animals and the corresponding technology. When expanding horizontally, the climate is\nsimilar enough that an empire can use the same successful plants and animals, while\nexpanding vertically requires the domestication of new plants and animals. If a civilization started in central-america,\nfor example, there would be very little land on the continent with a similar climate and\ntheir expansion would be severely limited. In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, theres\nthousands upon thousands and miles of similar climate that can be reached just by traveling\neast or west. There’s evidence to back this up. Just look at the maps of the four largest\nearly empires—the Qing Dynasty, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, and the\nMongol empire. They were all in Eurasia and they all expanded\nhorizontally. When some of the more modern empires expanded,\nthey had the technology to do so overseas. The three major modern empires were the British,\nSpanish, and French empires—each of which came from relatively similar climates. A major reason why America was able to succeed\nis because all the agriculture from Europe worked there. Climatically, Europe and America are nearly\nidentical. The majority of developed colonized countries\nare in the northern hemisphere just because they were closest to Europe, but formerly\nBritish countries like South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand are all highly developed and\nin the Southern Hemisphere. Their success over more northern countries\nin the southern hemisphere can also be partially attributed to their greater climate similarity\nto Europe. Let’s ask one more question. If our world only had one city, where would\nit logically be? Well if you take the location of every person\nin the world and average it out, you come to south-central Asia. That means that this general region is the\noptimum place to live on the planet, but where more specifically should our world city go. Well, this region is already in the Northern\nHemisphere and in Eurasia, so we’ve already covered those two criteria. We want a place within a hundred of so miles\nof the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains with rich mineral deposits—the single best\nplace for a city on earth just might be… Dhaka, Bangladesh. Every geographic model and theory says that\nthere is no better place on earth to put a city than here. There’s evidence to back this up: Dhaka\nis between the 4th and 18th largest metropolitan area on earth depending on how you define\nmetropolitan area, and Bangladesh is the sixth densest country on earth—there are 161 million\npeople living in an area about the size of England. History has affected geography enough that\nthe largest and most advanced civilizations are not all in South-Central Asia, but if\nwe started all over again, did humanity a second time, every geographic model says that\nthis region could be the origin and central point of human civilization.

They are the physical manifestations of countries\nabroad are they are crucial tools in the field of international relations. These can range in size from tiny, like the\nUK embassy in Mongolia which only has a handful of staff, to enormous, like the US embassy\nin Baghdad—a complex physically as large as the Vatican City which reached a peak of\n16,000 staff during the Iraq War. Big, influential countries will have embassies\nto almost every other country—the US, for example, has diplomatic missions to every\nUN recognized country in the world except St Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica,\nSt Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Bhutan, and North Korea. Smaller, less influential countries, on the\nother hand, might only have a few embassies—Tuvalu, for example, only has diplomatic missions\nto New Zealand, Fiji, Taiwan, the European Union in Belgium, and the United Nations in\nNew York. You see, there are embassies to non-state\norganizations—namely the UN and EU. You can even have embassies to agencies of\nthe UN—there’s one US diplomat in Rome with the lengthy title of, “United States\nAmbassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture.” Even traditionally closed off countries like\nNorth Korea have representation abroad. The DPRK has embassies in some quite western\ncountries like Germany, Sweden, and the UK and these three countries also each have embassies\nin North Korea. Now, part of the way these embassies can exist\nin even the most different and opposing of countries is because of how they are codified\nin international law. Every UN member state except for South Sudan,\nPalau, and the Solomon Islands has signed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. This sets out a number of laws on how embassies\nwork. Perhaps the most significant and well known\nis Article 22—“The premises of the mission shall be inviolable.” Unless invited by the ambassador or their\ngovernment, any representative of the host country’s government—be it a police officer,\ngovernment official, member of the military, or even firefighter—cannot enter the embassy. This, of course, is how Julian Assange stayed\nin the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years. He entered in 2012 when he was wanted in the\nUK for extradition to and subsequent arrest in Sweden. Assange stayed in the embassy while his request\nfor Ecuadorian political asylum was reviewed and, once it was granted, normally the next\nstep would be to go to Ecuador. Outside the embassy, though, waited British\npolice and so he would therefore have been arrested if he ever left. In the end, though, after seven years inside,\nit was the British police that arrested Assange as the Ecuadorians decided Assange had overstayed\nhis welcome and invited the police inside. The Vienna convention also lays out a few\nother important rules for embassies—the diplomats and the embassy are exempt from\nall taxes in the host country; the diplomats are allowed free movement around the host\ncountry; an embassy can have diplomatic couriers carrying diplomatic bags which cannot be seized\nor searched; diplomats are granted diplomatic immunity; the residences of diplomats are\nalso treated as an extension of the embassy and cannot be entered without permission;\ndiplomats cannot work or earn a profit when in their host country except for with the\nembassy; and then there are plenty of other even more minor rules\nNow, one big misconception about embassies is that this is an embassy. It’s not, this is a chancery—the building\nin which an embassy is located. The, “embassy” is not the building, its\nthe group people that work inside the building. It is the group of workers that represent\nthe country abroad. Another big misconception about embassy buildings\nare that they are the sovereign territory of the country they represent. This is not the case. It is also not they case that embassy buildings\nare in a state of extraterritoriality—that local laws don’t apply there as would be\nthe case in the United Nation headquarters or on many foreign military bases. In the case of embassy buildings, it’s not\nthat the laws of the host country don’t apply there, it’s just that many of the\npeople that make up the embassy, the diplomats, cannot be prosecuted for violating those laws\nand those that enforce the law, the police, can’t enter. Now, diplomats almost always follow the rules\nof their host country as failing to do so would be unproductive for the very nature\nof their job, but when they don’t, this can have serious implications. As an example, in April 1984, two students\nin Tripoli, Libya were hung for publicly opposing Gaddafi. In response, a protest was formed by a major\npolitical opposition group outside the Libyan embassy in London. On order from Gaddafi, an individual inside\nthe embassy building fired into the crowd with a machine gun, wounding eleven. One of those wounded was Yvonne Fletcher,\na young policewoman, who later died in the hospital from her injuries. Within 10 minutes of the shots going off,\nthe embassy building was surrounded by British police, blocking anyone from going in or out. Once it had been confirmed through forensic\nautopsy that the shots did indeed come from the embassy, negotiations began. The British tried to get permission to enter\nthe embassy building. You see, only some, but not all of the 30\npeople in the building were diplomats meaning that some, if they were found to have committed\nthe crime, could be arrested for it. The Libyans, however, would not grant access. Therefore, after five days of surrounding\nthe embassy, the British severed diplomatic relations with Libya, giving them another\nweek to leave the embassy and country. This, you see, is what countries can do when\ndiplomats misbehave. They can’t go into the embassy building,\nthey can’t arrest diplomats, but they can kick them out of their country. After this incident, diplomatic relations\nbetween the two countries didn’t normalize for decades and, even today, in 2019, the\ncase is still actively under investigation and its quite possible an arrest could happen\nin the future. Normally, though, embassies are more concerned\nwith building diplomacy. Typically, but not always, embassies are headed\nup by an ambassador. Sometimes, though, there are lapses where\none goes without an ambassador for a period of time and other times, a country might choose\nto recall their ambassador as a sign of displeasure. Now, the job of ambassador is tough to define. In the simplest since, an Ambassador is there\nto represent their country but what that entails varies wildly from person to person and post\nto post. There’s often a perception that all that\nambassadors do is schmooze and booze but, to be honest, that’s part of the job. They’re there to build and maintain relationships\nwith those that can help their country—politically, economically, or otherwise. That’s just part of diplomacy which is what\nthe embassy’s job as a whole is. This can be direct diplomacy, where the ambassador\nmight meet directly with a head of state, or soft diplomacy. Soft diplomacy can be things like China sending\npandas to foreign zoos, the US funding scholarships for foreign students, or France setting up\na branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi. They are more subtle ways that a nation can\ncurry public favor with another. On a smaller scale, embassies will often have\na portion of staff dedicated to promoting and exhibiting the art and culture of their\ncountry in the region. You’ll often see embassies financially supporting\nand sponsoring concerts of their country’s music, for example. Now, in addition to these ways of representing\none’s country, the embassy also represents its homeland through its actual building. As the public face of one country in another,\nit’s got to look the part. For example, some of the world’s most impressive\nand important embassies are in Washington, DC given that nearly every nation has a diplomatic\nmission there. The Chinese embassy building was designed\nby the children of I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American regarded as one of the world’s greatest\narchitects, and evokes the same sense of clean, contemporary grandeur and opulence common\nwith the greatest buildings back in the People’s Republic itself while still adhering to Feng\nShui principles. Just down the street there’s the embassy\nbuilding of the United Arab Emirates—a perhaps even more opulent structure clearly incorporating\naspects of Islamic Architecture. This building seems to purposefully command\na presence with its open sightline from the street allowing one to look in and up. Then there’s this section of the British\nEmbassy complex nearby—a structure resembling an old English Country Manor. While countries like China and UAE might be\nmore focused on pushing their modern image as newly wealthy nations, countries like the\nUK might draw more attention to their long and storied past. There’s then the whole realm of the architecture\nof American embassy complexes themselves. With necessity, after countless attacks on\nits embassies through history, the architecture and design of American embassy buildings evokes\nsecurity. Whether its the one in Berlin, Beijing, Bern,\nor Bangkok, they all have the look of a compound. They’re mostly modern, innovative designs,\na conscious choice to associate these values to the nation’s image, but they’re still\nmostly hidden behind tall walls and fences. There are still some, though, mostly in places\nwhere security is less of a concern, reflecting the earlier architectural style of the US\nsuch as the Georgian House of the US Embassy in Canberra, Australia—a building that would\nlook right at place in the American south. But when embassies are in certain places their\nbuildings can’t just be compound-style. They have to be compounds. As the physical representations of countries,\nembassies are the clearest targets for those wishing to send a message to a country. During wars, though, there is often more work\nthan ever for embassies to do in a country. This is why, as mentioned earlier, the US\nembassy in Baghdad, Iraq, ballooned to over 16,000 staff during the Iraq War. The embassy building was built in the Green\nZone—a highly fortified area along the Tigris River in Baghdad. This area, guarded by soldiers and walls more\nthan nine feet or three meters tall, was and still is home to much of the international\npresence in Baghdad. That included embassies of countries like\nthe US, UK, and Australia, but also some companies. War is big business and the Green Zone was\nhome to small field headquarters for many large, international engineering, construction,\nand private military firms contracted to help in the war. That is to say, the Green Zone was primarily\nhome to a large group of civilians working in Iraq which is why it was so heavily guarded. Given the security threat, the US embassy\nthere was built to be entirely self sufficient. It has its own generators, its own wells,\nits own water filtration plant, its own sewage plant, its own fire station, it even has its\nown internet uplink to circumvent the Iraqi network. It has its own phone network—both wired\nand wireless—which both operate pretty much as if they were in the US—they use the area\ncodes of New York and Virginia. Unlike in most cities where embassy staff\njust live in normal housing in the city, this embassy has its own block of fortified apartments. Even during the thick of the war, the embassy\ncompound had its own swimming pool, tennis courts, fitness center, department store,\nnail salon, and movie theatre. Topping it off is a helicopter pad—used\nto get the ambassador and other top diplomats around the country when they don’t want\nto confront the dangers of below. The diplomats serving as part of the US embassy\nin Baghdad do get another perk in addition to the pool and tennis courts and movie theatre\nand everything else—they get more money. You see, when working in the US foreign service,\nand its often similar when working for other countries’ foreign service, you essentially\nget more money the more foreign a place you go. If you’re serving pretty much anywhere in\nNorth America, Western Europe, Australasia, and a few other assorted countries, you get\nno bonus. If you serve in a place that has an extreme\nclimate, poor quality of healthcare, high crime, high pollution, or has any other factor\nthat makes it more difficult to live there as a foreigner, you get hardship pay which\nis a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5% to 35%. That 5% rate includes places like Costa Rica,\nthe Bahamas, Malta, and Bulgaria while the 35% rate is reserved for places like the Central\nAfrican Republic, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. That rate of hardship pay can also vary within\na country. For example, if you served at the US consulate\nin Dubai you’d only get a 5% bonus while serving at the US embassy in Abu Dhabi would\nget you 10%. There are also some places that, well, just\ndon’t seem all that hard to live in but do earn you hardship pay such as Ponta Delgada,\nPortugal, a well-known vacation destination. This is likely only included because of its\nisolation. On top of hardship pay, you can also get an\nadditional bonus if you serve in a place that is deemed dangerous. For example, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, gets you\n15% while places like Tripoli, Damascus, Kabul, Baghdad, and Juba will get you a 35% bonus. So, in a place like Baghdad, you get a 70%\nbonus just for the hardship and danger you put yourself through. This is how they get people to work at even\nthe harshest of postings without forcing them. On top of these two, there are also some other\nbonuses based off things like high cost of living, difficulty in staffing the post, and\nmore. Now, in the modern age, some have questioned\nwhether embassies still have a purpose. 100 years ago they very much had a purpose\nas communication was difficult, travel was slow, and countries therefore needed someone\non the ground who could speak on their behalf to others at a moment’s notice. Nowadays, though, messages can be relayed\ninstantaneously through a whole host of means so what’s the point? Well, ambassadors are not messengers. Ambassadors are representatives. They are there not only to work for their\ncountry within political systems, but also to promote it to the public as to increase\ntravel and trade with their country. Many argue, in fact, that these small, personal\nrelationships of our world’s diplomats tying together countries of hundreds of millions\nor billions are more important now than ever. If you want to work in the foreign service,\nthe US State Department has an extensive reading list of books that will help to get the knowledge\nyou need no matter which country you’re from. One book on there that I found quite interesting\nwas, “Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,” by Malcolm Gladwell. The book is all about how the unconscious\nbrain works in making decisions with very limited info. Blink, like so many other books, is available\nas an audiobook on Audible so you can listen to it wherever and whenever. I find that listening to books helps me fit\nin a lot more in and it helps make things like cleaning or commuting a lot more fun. Best of all, you can sign up for free at audible.com/wendover\nor text, “wendover” to 500-500 and download Blink, or any other audiobook for free in\naddition to two Audible originals also for free.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of March 1999 a terrified woman ran through the streets of New Mexico naked she'd escaped after being held captive by sadistic sexual torturer David Parker ray she wasn't his only victim I was scared I don't know if he was gonna kill me or not he could get a woman in virtually any position she was his sex slave more than 30 women had passed through Parker Ray's torture chamber the police suspected that many of them had been murdered I've never had any question that David Parker ray is a serial killer the police launched a vast search for bodies but Parker ray was always one step ahead David was a very intelligent individual and took great lengths to make sure that he was not discovered could one of America's most prolific serial killers get away with murder [Music] New Mexico a barren land with the second highest murder rate in America [Music] cut off from the world by 40,000 square miles of desert Truth or Consequences is a town where people go about their business and few questions are asked population 6,000 and falling true the consequences has kind of an undercurrent of criminal activity we investigated a murder where a guy who was stabbed 43 times and we had another murder where guy beat his wife and put on a trunk of the car burned her in the car then there was a man found dead in his apartment he had blue panties on and no other clothes he had a doorknob inserted in his rectum this is just a community where strange bizarre crimes occur on the 22nd of March 1999 the police received a call that would open a case far more shocking than anything that seen before the call came from a panicked local after 21 year-old Cynthia V Hill burst into her house she was naked except for a metal dog collar attached to a 6-foot chain so the officers arrived on the scene Cynthia Till's telling them don't let them get me they kidnapped me they tied me up they raid me the officers of course you know who and where and all these questions are coming up in their minds and sometimes it's really difficult to get answers from a frantic person Cinthia V Hill was a prostitute with a heroin addiction she said she was abducted by a client and driven to a house on the outskirts of Truth or Consequences as far as when a police officer is called to by an incident bargain a prostitute that's always in the officer's mind is what degree of credibility do I give this lady especially if it's a real bizarre story the house belongs to David Parker ray a 59 year old mechanic Cynthia said that she was on a bed in a kind of expanded trailer house she was naked she was handcuffed and she had a collar around her neck which was attached to a pole she was given a bucket for a toilet she was sexually assaulted she was repeatedly sexually assaulted she was under the impression she was going to be killed so she was desperate to get out Cynthia V Hill said that she was held in this house for three days on the third day the MTV Hill said that a fight ensued a lamp was broken Cynthia V Hill then was able to escape out the back door of this residence Parker ray was arrested the police obtained a search warrant for his house to investigate the prostitutes allegations [Music] once they go inside the house they find where Cynthia had been held in the sunken living room area they see the bed they see the pole that there's some chains and manacles there there's a bucket with her waist on the floor [Music] there was obvious signs of a struggle and disarray in the room obviously what they saw did not look like the area of somebody who had been kept there voluntarily the such team also found a collection of sinister sexual devices everything that they were seeing did nothing for them except to add evidence and corroboration to what Cynthia their victim was telling them but nothing could prepare them for what they would find inside a simple white trailer at the side of Parker Ray's house wasn't really until the utility trailer was open that we really began to get a good understanding of what we were potentially dealing with then Pandora's box was open in the desert town of Truth or Consequences prostitute Cynthia V Hill was recovering in hospital she had escaped from three days of sexual torture at the hands of David Parker ray Parker ray had been arrested he was a 59 year old mechanic and a father of two foreign state Renuka Richard David Ray he claimed that the prostitute had agreed to a session of rough bondage yes you do at Parker Ray's house the police were discovering the horrifying truth the search team had arrived at a seemingly innocuous white trailer it was pretty pretty amazing it was remarkable I'd never seen anything like it in my life the first thing my eyes focused on was this black chair which turned out to be a gynecology chair just sitting there empty there was medical equipment and everywhere drills modified drills with sexual devices on them in cages I mean it was just this unbelievable looking den this was a torture chamber David Paulk array cooled the trailer his toy box or Satan's den to see it the first time just kind of gave you a feeling of sickness and it was just remarkable how everything was set up everything in here denoted pain everything in here denoted destruction there were several several items in there that were obviously meticulously crafted by hand and were very very sinister David was known as very adept with his hands as an excellent mechanic by day Parker ray worked for the local state park he was well respected for his technical ability to those who knew him he was not the kind of man who tortured women in his spare time oh he was just a real nice guy he just real nice real smart he was always eager to help these other guys do things you know around here these are some he made he named them stink catchers that's a rope trim piece of pipe just making anything it's for the creative piece of work you get down then he had an ankle spreader this looks like something that he would have made and he has a labeled ankle spreader he could get a woman in virtually any position that he wanted her in she was his sex slave when they entered this this trailer and then he had the dildo fashioned out of looks like a plastic pipe actually these are nails that have been melted into this plastic collar and this would be inserted in her vagina or anal canal and he would work it and work it until he could get it all the way in and then they would have these spikes here they're going to go in you're gonna get poked it's going to be very painful and rip their inner thighs out I have to wonder how many people came in contact with all this stuff [Music] Palka raise terrifying den was evidence of a long campaign of sexual torture the consensus was pretty clear that there were gonna be additional victims here for example the utility trailer was taken apart virtually and we collected trinkets rings necklaces jewelry they came from somebody despite police appeals for more women to come forward Cynthia was still the only known victim but as a prostitute and drug addict she might not be believed in court the police needed more credible witnesses inside the toy box Paul Caray had set up two video cameras the suspicion was that he had recorded the suffering of his captives it made sense to believe and was logical to deduce that there were videotapes somewhere and many many were found who were probably a hundred at least a hundred most of the tapes contain nothing of relevance but one would prove explosive it showed Parker ray testing his equipment then it cut and when it came back to life Parker ray was with a captive it's what you see here is the inside of the toy box you see a youngish blond-haired woman with david strapped down naked he's standing over top of her or kneeling next to her at all times he's constantly touching her and it's obvious that he's trying to get some kind of sexual gratification out of this she appeared to be unconscious or at least unresponsive to anything he was doing to her this hasn't had any of the earmarks of a consensual encounter between two people who just enjoy this kind of behavior the videotape was crucial evidence of another victim but who she was was a mystery we're looking at this videotape and we need to know who this person is he moves her leg at one point and what's exposed on her right calf on the outside of her right calf is a tattoo and you can see it in the video but it's not clear and it looks like a pretty you know it looked like a pretty big tattoo so we took this tape to the FBI to have it enhanced once the image was enhanced we provided that to the media very shortly afterwards a woman came forward and said that's my tattoo that's me that tattoo I have is unique nobody else has it Cali Van Cleave was a 25 year old child minder she was a friend of Parker Ray's daughter but had no recollection of ever going to his house and no idea or the FBI had a picture of her tattoo they told me that it came off of a a video they found in David's house - I box as they called it it was weird and I was scared initially it was clear that she was having difficulty remembering everything that had happened to her in the utility trailer and in her experience with David before the FBI contacted me I used to have nightmares of being tied to a table or handcuffs or duct tape scared me but I could never put any of it together and then when the FBI called then I knew they weren't just dreams nightmares they were real Kelly was struggling to remember the details of what Parker Ray had done to her but the police have made a chilling discovery in Parker Ray's house which would explain everything a tape recording in his own voice that he played to initiate his victims hello there bitch I'm going to tell you in detail why you have been kidnapped what's going to happen to you this was sinister stuff now you are obviously here against your will you're gonna be kept chained in a variety of different positions usually with your legs our knees forced wide apart you'll be raped thoroughly and repeatedly in every holy of God midway through the tape revealed that Kelly's memory loss may have been no accident you're gonna be drugged up real heavy with a combination ova sodium pentothal and phenobarbital you're not gonna remember a fucking thing about this little adventure or what has happened to you sodium pentothal and phenobarbital numb pain and induce amnesia it seemed Parker Rae was using drugs to control his victims and ensure they would not remember his crimes maybe explain some of the things that were done to me being tied down and how uncomfortable you're gonna feel and being used as a sex slave Parker ray release Kelly three days after taking a captive confident that she would never remember her ordeal [Music] [Laughter] [Music] but as the police questioned her memories started to surface over time she was able to piece together elements of her captivity in the toy box I didn't know how long I had been there I could see under the duct tape once in a while had all kinds of six devices he whips and chains and stuff I remember him coming and going several times but I don't know how many times when he was in there he was in there for a long time I was scared I remember telling him that I wanted to go home I didn't know if he was gonna kill me or not I don't ever remember drinking or eating anything he let me up to use a porta potty once but I was shackled to do that I remember him using different kinds of toys on me and they hurt that's about all I remember the police now had a credible witness but not necessarily one who could get Parker ray behind bars potential weakness that she had she didn't remember certain things she didn't have a clear recollection of others and that weakens the case and the overall picture that the jury is going to be given of exactly what David was up to the prosecution needed more and by Paul corazon admission there were many more victims to find in his tape recordings he indicated that he had been involved in sexual assault since he was 15 David was arrested when he was 59 so he has approximately 44 years of practice as of the time this tape was made I've taken 37 women for these purposes maybe more but now with so many victims unaccounted for there was a fear that Parker Ray was more than a sadistic torture he could be a prolific serial killer you are expendable it may sound harsh and cold but I won't have any qualms at all about slicing your throat if you believe what David says on the tape is true that he rapes and tortures women there's no reason not to believe the other parts about killing women and disposing of their bodies is also true death was a constantly resurfacing idea from David not from us but from David in his writings and his drawings in his tapes everything revolved around death I've never had any question that David Parker ray is a serial killer there's never been a doubt in my mind about it whether the case was going to be a murder trial would depend on whether we could link gave it to the actual killing of victims if Paul Caray was a serial killer he lived in the perfect place to hide the bodies his house was on the shores of Elephant Butte Lake a43 miles long and 200 feet deep it's the largest body of water in New Mexico there was a map that we recovered in David Parker Ray's house that was just a map of the lake with X's on it David had a sailboat a large skiff sailing boat with depth finding equipment and he knew that Lake very very well and he knew where the deepest places in that lake work I was hoping that we were going to have a body I was praying that we were going to have a body there were overall like between two and three full dive missions that were performed there without being able to locate any evidence that we could connect definitively to the Parker ray investigation David had the perfect job if he wants to hide bodies or whatever he had access to every nook and cranny of Elephant Butte State Park he had access to areas that are kept under lock and key that keep the public away from but to which he had access we searched caves holes in the ground wells mines lakes we searched everywhere we could possibly think that was endlessly frustrating [Music] the case against Parker ray was weak the best witness had a patchy memory and unless bodies could be found there was a chance that a murderer would walk free he was an intelligent man and capable of going the extra mile and making an extra effort especially when it came to this kind of behavior to do what he needed to do to avoid detection and I believe that's what he did but Parker Ray hadn't thought of everything an extraordinary confession from one of his acquaintances was about to blow the investigation wide open police believed that victims of David Parker Ray's campaign of sexual torture were buried in the New Mexico desert but no bodies have been discovered and the case against him was on rocky ground the only known surviving victims were a heroin addicted prostitute and a woman whose memory of her captivity had been scrambled by Parker Ray's cocktail of drugs but Cali Van Cleave clearly remembered what happened before she was drugged in July 1996 she was abducted from this once bustling bar on the outskirts of Truth or Consequences we rounded up a bunch of friends and went bar-hopping and this is where we ended up we always ended up here no matter where we started this is where we quit there used to be a little mini bar sitting here pull tables right there then we were playing pool and I had ordered a beer and I left to take one of my drunk friends home and came back and some of my other friends left and at the end of the evening it was just me and Jessie Jesse ray David's daughter Jessie agreed to give Kelly a lift home but she drove straight to her father's house the fact that it was his own daughter kidnapping just shows the depth of his resolve when it came to this behavior and and also showed his lack of emotional involvement with just about anybody or anything I just remember being on her couch her dad's couch that's when they held the knife to my throat I put the dog collar on we duct tape and handcuffs and I ended up tied to a table Jesse ray was arrested for her role in Kelly's abduction are you optimistic that you'll be out soon what it wasn't the only time she'd taken someone home to meet her father in July 1997 one year after Kelly's abduction a friend of hers had gone missing from the same bar Marie Parker was a 21 year old mother of two it was almost midnight and she said she was gonna go home and check out her kids she'd be right back by the time the bar closed at 2:00 o'clock she still wasn't there and her car was still there so but somebody said Jesse followed Maria no one has heard from the reap our curses that night she had two little girls there was no way she was gonna leave her kids so I knew something had happened the similarities between Kelly's abduction and Marie's disappearance seemed unlikely to be coincidence she's a woman that disappeared about two years ago you know with Marie Parker we knew he was involved but we didn't have enough information or evidence to pin anything on him you were a part of that on the night Marie disappeared Jessie Ray had been at the bar with a friend of her father's called Roy Yancy the police suspected he was an accomplice and brought him in for questioning his statement was astonishing from what I understand is that he's had many years of kidnapping and torturing and killing women from the story that Roy gave was that Marie Parker had in fact been a victim of David Parker ray that she had been abducted while she was in the toy box she was systematically tortured over a period of a couple of days when she wasn't being tortured she was placed on a cot and slid underneath a part of the the the wall and the toy box that they could shut and lock and at the end of all of this the information that Roy Yancy gave us was that he was instructed to kill Marie Parker by strangulation how did you come up with the idea to kill Marie David Ray Parker's idea that's pretty remarkable it just seemed like it went up to a different level and each level went up to it became more overwhelming and then I began to wonder just know where is it gonna end I know they ended up giving me a rope and telling me - okay but you think he wouldn't die in fast enough was he struggling or yes we have no doubt that his statement was accurate his details were such that it's unquestionable that Roy Yancy killed Marie Parker I was told not to tell anybody anything or I was gonna be killed and thrown into dips and who told you that if rui NC could take the police to Marie Parker's body that finally have the evidence to link Parker ray to murder David and Roy according to Roy Yancy took the body out to a remote location in the desert rolled it down a ravine covered it up with a little bit of dirt and then drove back and Roy was very specific and detailed about the location where this happened he remembered he said pretty well where this was we felt it if we were able to locate this body it was going to be a domino effect and soon this was going to lead to more and more and more we spent the better part of a week with Roy Yancy going to several different locations we had 40 people out looking in these areas we had helicopters out looking in these areas and still we weren't able to recover a body and Roy's I guess hypothesis which seems to be credible and make sense is that David returned to that location after the body had been disposed of and relocated it yet again David Paulk array had been meticulous in avoiding detection we spent a great deal of time chasing an intelligent man who was well versed in what he was doing and and certainly able to cover his tracks very effectively we were always one step behind him there's thousands upon thousands of deep narrow ravines nooks and crannies and where do you look we could be standing above her right now and never know it and I often wonder how close did we actually come to to her or some of the victims during the course of this Roy Yancy pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years but David Parker ray maintained his innocence and without Mary Parker's body murder charges could not be brought against him it's extremely frustrating to know that he's committed murders and yet not have sufficient evidence to bring this matter to a resolution in a court of law but the fact that we couldn't prosecute him for murder made it all the more important that was successfully prosecuted for the rape torture kidnappings that we could prove in court that he did the trial of David Parker ray began on the 29th of June 2000 his fate now lay entirely in the hands of Kelli Van Cleve despite her patchy memory she would have to convince a jury that he had kidnapped and sexually tortured her I didn't want to go to court I didn't have to go face him but I did it he couldn't be out on the streets any longer had to do it because I had to do what I could to save other women as Kelly took the stand Parker Rae was just feet away it was the first time she'd seen him since her captivity he was just sitting there with a smug look on his face and it pissed me off he acted like he was totally innocent and he had done nothing wrong I didn't want to cry and let him know how much he hurt me I didn't want to be his victim that was difficult Kelly explained what she could of her ordeal in the toy box but under cross-examination she was attacked rigorously the defense point-of-view has to be in this case that she's not a credible witness and therefore should not be believed because she couldn't remember what happened you sit up there on the stand and wonder are these guys gonna believe me David's story was that she came over quite willingly that I had some beers and that she had consensual sex that the the sex became kinkier as she stayed longer and that he cleaned her up and sent her home at the end of it just lies I think that was the most difficult part was all the lies that they said I could have faced David without the lies people often do things that they can't live with and so they have to change the way they feel about what happened or the way they report what happened or the way they feel about themselves to account for that the defense's claims that Kelly had consented to be in the toy box were contradicted by Park RA himself on the initiation tape that he played his victims you are obviously here against your will you'll be raped thoroughly and repeatedly in every holy of God but there was a problem Kelly could not remember if Parker Rae had played the tape to her so the judge ruled it was not relevant the jury was not allowed to hear it the suppression of the audio tape weakened our case because they were not able to hear David's actual planning preparation and his own voice they're going to be kept like an animal as far as I'm concerned you're a pretty piece of meat your pussy and asshole is gonna get a real workout this was essentially a confession the prosecution did have one more weapon to draw on the video footage of Parker ray torturing Kelly in the toy box when you look at the tape you see that there's no evidence of injury because he's not beating her he's touching her gently he caresses her breast he lightly rubs her stomach he lightly rubs her arms she's able to sit there and loosen up her joints and the way you would if you'd done something strenuous and that was our interpretation of the tape I knew the defense was gonna try to turn everything around on me but I didn't think that with the tape I figured everybody would know everybody could see I wasn't there willingly after a two-week trial the jury retired to consider whether Kelly's testimony was enough to lock up our Caray for life Kelly's the one who the jury has to believe in order for them to return a guilty verdict I didn't think there was going to be any way that a jury would come back with a not guilty verdict in this when they finally made a decision and everybody got back to the courtroom I knew it was gonna be a guilty verdict it had to have been a guilty verdict they fooled me the judge required a unanimous decision and on July the 13th 2000 the jury announced the verdict some jurors did not believe Kelly's testimony so Parker ray could not be convicted it was a hung jury when they came back with a hung jury verdict I about fainted literally I didn't understand it the decision was made to retry the case this time with a different jury and a different judge I didn't want to go through court again but I had to he was not gonna hurt anybody else [Music] nine months after the first trial ended the retrial got underway in a boost to the prosecution the new judge decided that Parker Ray's initiation tape was relevant to the case and allowed it to be heard Parker raised voice filled the courtroom hello there bitch here probably think you're gonna be raped and you're buckin sure right about that remember hearing his voice and it sends shivers down my spine you're not gonna remember a fucking thing about this little adventure it was like you could cut through the air with a knife as far as I'm concerned you're a pretty piece of meat be smart and be a survivor have a nice day the audiotape was a crucial piece of evidence but everything rested on Kelly's testimony for Parker ray to be found guilty Kelly would have to take the stand once again and convinced the entire jury that she had been kidnapped and tortured I was vulnerable I was scared but I was angry that he got away with the first one was he gonna get away with the second one the police believe that David Parker ray was a serial killer but as no bodies had been found he couldn't be charged with murder instead he had been tried for the kidnap rape and torture of Kelly Van Cleave but at the first trial the jury had been unable to agree unanimously that he was guilty at the retrial once again everything rested on Kelly unless her testimony was believed by the entire jury the charges against Parker ray could be dropped it's very difficult to tell people you don't know intimate things sexual things about your life we tested her credibility in the fire of cross-examination and trial twice her life must have been hell I think it was harder the second time than it was the first time because I had already been there I already had to tell my my story to thousands of people I didn't know [Music] and that first jury didn't believe me on April the 16th 2001 after a week-long trial the jury retired to consider what they'd heard it took them just five hours to reach a unanimous verdict I was sweating I didn't know what they were gonna say had no idea [Music] we got guilty then they got 224 years in prison and we partied do you believe Kelly's version of events was true so the question is whether I believe that she was abducted by the REA family and held captive and and raped and tortured yeah I believe it but you'll his defense attorney you seem to be saying that your client is guilty I do seem to be saying that Don I in a deal with the prosecution David Parker ray gave up his right to appeal in return his daughter Jessie was released without trial for her role in Kelly's abduction I knew that not everybody I would ever defend would be innocent I knew that some of the people that I represented would be truly bad people and I believe that on the spectrum of people who do not belong in society David Parker ray is right in there [Music] was justice done don't think justice can ever be done in these types of cases what David did to these women no amount of punishment to him can take away what those women have to live with David took too much of me away I feel like I'm a totally different person I don't go anywhere I don't trust anybody I miss the old me the one that used to be wild and crazy and sassy and wasn't scared I would do just about anything to get the old lay back I wish he wouldn't have died I want him alive I would ask him why why me why did he take me home why didn't he kill me I wish he was still alive so he could tell us what happened to all those other girls where he buried him how he killed them so those other families could have some closure [Music]
