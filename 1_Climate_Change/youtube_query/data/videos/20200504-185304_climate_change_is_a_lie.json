            "description": "Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube exploit our tribalism to keep us watching ads. That makes them a perfect target for trolls, conspiracy theorists, and con artists. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSocial media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are built to cater to the base preferences and desires of their users -- figuring out what information people enjoy with and then showing them more of it. That\u2019s a great way to keep people online, but it also makes these platforms prime target for con artists. People are naturally drawn to inflammatory and sensational news stories, regardless of whether or not they're true. So bad actors -- conspiracy theorists, trolls, and fake news writers -- have been tremendously successful in using these platforms to spread false and divisive content that exploit people\u2019s tribal instincts. In 2016, it was Macedonian teens making thousands of dollars publishing inflammatory fake stories about Hillary Clinton. After the Parkland shooting, it was random YouTubers going viral by accusing students of being crisis actors. Even the Russian trolls who meddled in the presidential election did so by posting low-quality, highly emotional content to social media -- content they knew would go viral.The problem with these social media sites isn\u2019t that a few bad apples are ruining the fun. It\u2019s that they\u2019re designed to reward bad apples. And as long as con artists can use these platforms to prey on people\u2019s most base desires, social media sites will continue reflecting the worst of human nature back at us.Read more of Jay Van Bevel\u2019s work here: https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-public...

            "description": "Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they\u2019re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it\u2019s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

            "description": "Government shutdowns are disasters for Republicans, but right-wing media makes it almost impossible for the GOP to compromise in a budget fight.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOThe U.S. government has experienced three major shutdowns over the past twenty-five years. In 1995, it was a fight over programs like Medicare. In 2013, it was over an effort to defund Obamacare. In 2018, it was over funding for a border wall. And while each crisis revolved around a different policy fight, they all followed a similar pattern: Republicans, egged on by right-wing pundits and talk radio, were pressured into forcing a government shutdown that eventually blew up in their faces. Ever since the 90s, Republicans have become dependent on right-wing outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh to rally and mobilize their supporters. That\u2019s garnered them success in major elections, but it\u2019s also backed them into a corner. Republicans know they can\u2019t betray the conservative pundits who helped elect them, but those pundits are becoming more and more ideologically extreme, pressuring Republicans to shut the government down over even minor funding disputes. As long as right-wing media has a stranglehold on conservative politics, Republicans will keep finding themselves steered into crises they know they can\u2019t win.

But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies.

            "description": "While major news networks have struggled to figure out the right way to cover the Trump administration, political satirists like Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Meyers have demonstrated why comedy can be such a powerful antidote to bullshit.Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/The first few months of the Trump administration have been a goldmine for late-night comedians and political satirists. Shows like Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, Saturday Night Live, and Late Night With Seth Meyers have enjoyed ratings boosts thanks to their regular lampooning of the Trump White House.But beyond the jokes and sight gags, political satirists have done an excellent job of seriously covering the Trump administration \u2014 sometimes even better than major TV news networks. And that\u2019s because while traditional journalists feel compelled to take President Trump\u2019s often absurd statements and conspiracy theories seriously, political satirists have demonstrated an extremely low tolerance for bullshit.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

            "description": "Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube exploit our tribalism to keep us watching ads. That makes them a perfect target for trolls, conspiracy theorists, and con artists. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSocial media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are built to cater to the base preferences and desires of their users -- figuring out what information people enjoy with and then showing them more of it. That\u2019s a great way to keep people online, but it also makes these platforms prime target for con artists. People are naturally drawn to inflammatory and sensational news stories, regardless of whether or not they're true. So bad actors -- conspiracy theorists, trolls, and fake news writers -- have been tremendously successful in using these platforms to spread false and divisive content that exploit people\u2019s tribal instincts. In 2016, it was Macedonian teens making thousands of dollars publishing inflammatory fake stories about Hillary Clinton. After the Parkland shooting, it was random YouTubers going viral by accusing students of being crisis actors. Even the Russian trolls who meddled in the presidential election did so by posting low-quality, highly emotional content to social media -- content they knew would go viral.The problem with these social media sites isn\u2019t that a few bad apples are ruining the fun. It\u2019s that they\u2019re designed to reward bad apples. And as long as con artists can use these platforms to prey on people\u2019s most base desires, social media sites will continue reflecting the worst of human nature back at us.Read more of Jay Van Bevel\u2019s work here: https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-public...

Dating as we know it didn\u2019t really start until the Industrial Revolution when young people left farms and small towns to flock to cities for work. They got jobs in factories, bars, and restaurants and being away from their families for the first time offered them the freedom to mix and match with other young people. Ever since then the way single people have gotten together has been dictated by the ups and downs of the economy in the United States. We talk to Harvard\u2019s Moira Weigel, author of \u201cThe Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating\u201d about how our woes about dating are nothing new, they\u2019ve been around since people starting pairing off.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

            "description": "Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube exploit our tribalism to keep us watching ads. That makes them a perfect target for trolls, conspiracy theorists, and con artists. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSocial media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are built to cater to the base preferences and desires of their users -- figuring out what information people enjoy with and then showing them more of it. That\u2019s a great way to keep people online, but it also makes these platforms prime target for con artists. People are naturally drawn to inflammatory and sensational news stories, regardless of whether or not they're true. So bad actors -- conspiracy theorists, trolls, and fake news writers -- have been tremendously successful in using these platforms to spread false and divisive content that exploit people\u2019s tribal instincts. In 2016, it was Macedonian teens making thousands of dollars publishing inflammatory fake stories about Hillary Clinton. After the Parkland shooting, it was random YouTubers going viral by accusing students of being crisis actors. Even the Russian trolls who meddled in the presidential election did so by posting low-quality, highly emotional content to social media -- content they knew would go viral.The problem with these social media sites isn\u2019t that a few bad apples are ruining the fun. It\u2019s that they\u2019re designed to reward bad apples. And as long as con artists can use these platforms to prey on people\u2019s most base desires, social media sites will continue reflecting the worst of human nature back at us.Read more of Jay Van Bevel\u2019s work here: https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-public...

In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.For more from Tim Urban, visit Wait But Why: http://www.waitbutwhy.com/Get TED Talks recommended just for you!

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation.

But thanks to Fox News, that\u2019s not always true. The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage. The result is a media ecosystem that advantages Republicans by paying disproportionate attention to right-wing talking points.

But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

Ford admits that she can\u2019t remember key details about the incident, including whose house it took place at and how she got home afterward.Those gaps in her memory have led many of her critics to argue that Ford isn\u2019t credible. Fox News in particular has seized on holes in Ford\u2019s account to raise doubts about her allegations , even floating the theory that Ford may be confusing Kavanaugh for a doppelganger.But forgetting non-essential details is not unusual for trauma survivors. As my colleague Brian Resnick has explained, human memory is notoriously faulty. We often forget or misremember details about our experiences, even if we initially perceived them clearly. That\u2019s especially true for trauma survivors -- like victims of sexual assault. When humans experience intense trauma, our brains have a tendency to hyper-focus on certain pieces of information while ignoring non-essential details. A victim of sexual assault might vividly remember her attacker\u2019s cologne but struggle to remember the layout of the room she was in or what happened in the hours after the attack. Ford, for example, claims to vividly remember the \u201cuproarious laughter\u201d that she heard between Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge while she was being assaulted.In other words, critics who fixate on gaps in Ford\u2019s memory are likely holding trauma survivors to a standard they won\u2019t be able to meet.

When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera \u2014 then known as \u201cel Rapido\u201d\u2014 was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

            "description": "Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it\u2019s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim\u2019s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers.

            "description": "Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world\u2019s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

            "description": "Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it\u2019s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Recruits are advised to report to training in much better shape, as the IST run is only half the distance Physical Fitness Test required of all recruits prior to graduation.Incentive Training in Marine Corps boot camp is common if they don\u2019t meet standards for Marine Corps training.Grass Week is also called \u201csnap in\u201d. The recruits spend time practicing their firing positions, also called \u201csnapping in\u201d. In Marine Corps Basic Warrior Training, or BWT, recruits learn the fundamentals of combat; they sleep in the field and eat MRE\u2019s. The Crucible is the defining moment of USMC bootcamp. Recruits will learn the standards required to pass the Crucible, they know how long the Marine Corps Crucible is and how to pass The Crucible.Marine Corps Emblem \u201cEGA\u201d Ceremony - The Eagle Globe and Anchor emblem is the symbol the embodies what sets Marines apart from other branches of service who delineate themselves by occupation specialty or demonstrate allegiance to a specific unit through the wearing of a patch or emblem.

The Drill Instructors continue mentoring the new Marines by conducting discussion periods on critical topics that will help the new Marines to be successful in their transition to the operational forces.Battalion Commander\u2019s Inspection in Marine Corps Recruit Training in 2019.The Battalion Commander\u2019s Inspection is the final opportunity for the new Marines to be evaluated prior to graduation.

            "description": "We got an inside look at the United States Secret Service's intense, six-month basic training program. Senior video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent three days inside the James J. Rowley Training Center in Laurel, Maryland, where he observed recruits at various stages of training.According to the Secret Service, about one in every 100 applicants makes it through the agency's intense vetting process to become a recruit. The base salary for new agents and officers is $47,000 per year.After spending three months at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in either Artesia, New Mexico or Glynco, Georgia, recruits return to Laurel for three more months of Secret Service-specific training.Although we were allowed to film inside the academy, much of the training remained secret. According to the training center's deputy chief, Michael Buck, this was intended to avoid \"giving people specifics into our protective methodologies ... we don't advertise our playbook.\"UPDATE: In the video, we identify a car as a Dodge Challenger, when what is seen on screen is a Dodge Charger.

            "description": "Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world\u2019s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

            "description": "North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim\u2019s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator\u2019s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?\"People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,\" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn\u2019t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that \"The Greed Program,\" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.Check out our web special:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/greed/s-32898_______Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

            "description": "Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it\u2019s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Full Marine Corps boot camp documentary covering all phases of Marine Corps Boot Camp on Parris Island.  Covers USMC boot camp arrival (receiving) through graduation. Understand what it's like at Marine Corps boot camp on day 1 all the way through the USMC Crucible. If you want to answer the question, How do you become a Marine?, this video is your answer.Marine Corps IST-Fitness standards for Marine Corps boot camp. Male recruits must be able to do 3 pull-ups or 34 push-ups & female recruits must be able to do 1 pull-up or 15 push-ups.  Both are required to do 44 crunches in 2 minutes and run 1.5 miles in under 13:30 for men and 15 minutes for women. Recruits are advised to report to training in much better shape, as the IST run is only half the distance Physical Fitness Test required of all recruits prior to graduation.Incentive Training in Marine Corps boot camp is common if they don\u2019t meet standards for Marine Corps training.Grass Week is also called \u201csnap in\u201d. The recruits spend time practicing their firing positions, also called \u201csnapping in\u201d. In Marine Corps Basic Warrior Training, or BWT, recruits learn the fundamentals of combat; they sleep in the field and eat MRE\u2019s. The Crucible is the defining moment of USMC bootcamp. Recruits will learn the standards required to pass the Crucible, they know how long the Marine Corps Crucible is and how to pass The Crucible.Marine Corps Emblem \u201cEGA\u201d Ceremony - The Eagle Globe and Anchor emblem is the symbol the embodies what sets Marines apart from other branches of service who delineate themselves by occupation specialty or demonstrate allegiance to a specific unit through the wearing of a patch or emblem. The only symbol Marines recognize is the Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. Receiving the emblem signifies that the recruits have earned the title of United States Marine. They will now stand with their instructors as the Nation\u2019s newest Marines.The USMC Boot Camp Gas Chamber experience is intense.Marine Corps Inspections are frequent and demanding during USMC boot camp.USMC Phase 2 includes swim qualification. All Marine recruits are required to know how to survive in the water. \u201cEvery Marine a rifleman\u201d is a mantra that is central to the Marine Corps culture. Marine recruits must meet standards to qualify in Marine Corps marksmanship.Marine Corps boot camp Phase 4. During Phase 4, the new Marines begin to transition from their roles as recruits into that of United States Marines. During this phase new Marines now call their Drill Instructors by their rank. Instead of \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d it is \u201cSgt\u201d or \u201cSSgt\u201d. The Drill Instructors continue mentoring the new Marines by conducting discussion periods on critical topics that will help the new Marines to be successful in their transition to the operational forces.Battalion Commander\u2019s Inspection in Marine Corps Recruit Training in 2019.The Battalion Commander\u2019s Inspection is the final opportunity for the new Marines to be evaluated prior to graduation. As in previous inspections, they are measured on their appearance, but more importantly, the Battalion Commander is evaluating them on their confidence, character, and whether or not they embody the Marine Corps\u2019 Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment.Marine Corps Family DayOn Family Day excited families line the streets and try to catch a glimpse of their Marine running by in formation. Family Day starts off with a motivational run, referred to as the \u201cMOT Run\u201d throughout the Depot. All graduating Marines run in formation while singing motivational cadence, loudly signaling successful completion of Recruit Training. As recruits run to the cadence of their Drill Instructors, parents, family members and friends line the streets and cheer as they try to find the face of their loved one among the crowd of new Marines.After the MOT Run, the new Marines have a chance to see family and friends for the first time during on-base liberty.Marine Corps boot camp graduation is conducted on Friday in a formal ceremony and parade, attended by family and friends.",

            "description": "Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world\u2019s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?\"People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,\" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn\u2019t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that \"The Greed Program,\" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.Check out our web special:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/greed/s-32898_______Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

            "description": "Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it\u2019s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim\u2019s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator\u2019s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.For more from Tim Urban, visit Wait But Why: http://www.waitbutwhy.com/Get TED Talks recommended just for you!

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement\u2014and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017.

For his talk, Joseph tells the story of how he witnessed the shotgun suicide of one his classmates. This experience was traumatic and life altering. His story however will not be focused on the pain or hardships this moment had on his life, but rather the good that has come out of it. Joseph hopes to share his moment in time with the world in order to raise awareness about the reality of mentally based hindrances, and spread the word about EMDR therapy.  As well as help the world look at themselves deeply and evaluate what they hold dear.Joseph Keogh is a nineteen year old freshmen at Penn State Behrend.

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

It\u2019s literally impossible, to not be motivated if you implement this habit. We all struggle with motivation from time to time, it\u2019s not bad to admit this. But it is bad, to allow yourself to stay unmotivated. There are many people who talk about motivation, as if it\u2019s something that you get. But we have to realize, that motivation is just an emotion, and all emotions are transient, meaning they come and they go. So, you can rely on motivation, because it comes and it goes. Implementing this strategy will also force you to be self disciplined, because you really do have no other option. Want to learn how to Disciplined? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GqBx...",

Basically you don't sleep for one day, and you go to bed at the desired time the next day.However that's like putting a band-aid on a bigger problem. It's also one of the worst things you can do for your health, even if the end goal is a healthy sleep schedule.Rather than pulling an all-nighter, you should focus on fixing your sleep habits.It's good to to understand how your body knows when it's time to wake up or go to sleep. There are two factors that regulate this and I'll talk about them in this video. You'll also get some actionable tips at the end.#fixsleep #resetsleep #sleepbetter",

It's where I found out about The 2 Minute Rule.US: https://amzn.to/2nNYA1nEU: https://amzn.to/2miAV8LBreak Your Mental Resistance With The 2 Minute Rule (animated)Why is it so hard to follow up on our new habits?One of the reasons is that the habit we're trying to form can seem a little overwhelming, so we have this mental resistance.In the beginning, when we're super motivated it's much easier to do something. For example; going to the gym for 1 hour doesn't seem that hard, because the initial motivation is a powerful driving force.But when we're motivated it's also easy to impose some super high expectations on ourselves.We think: \"Ok, so I went to the gym for 1 hour the first few days. From now on I'll to go to the gym for 1 full hour every single day.\"But once that initial motivation fades away after a few days, there is now nothing that's driving us forward, and we haven't really formed a habit yet.That's why when we're unmotivated, we'll probably just skip gym altogether, as dedicating a whole hour to it seems daunting.So instead of relying on motivation to push us forward, we should focus on making our new habit, an actual habit.Let me explain what I mean, by introducing you to the 2 minute rule.",

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

There are literally 1000's of success books out there, so why should this one be any different? Stephen Covey researched the last 200 years of success literature and found something interesting.. In the last 50 years, most of the books have been focused on the personality ethic - Things like public image, how you dress, how you perform in social interactions, positive mental attitude, skills and techniques to get people to behave in certain ways. These books focus on how to appear rather than how to actually be. The 7 habits of highly effective people takes an inside out approach \u2013 it focuses on the character ethic rather than the personality ethic.1 - be proactive2 - begin with the end in mind3 - put first things first4 - think win win 5 - seek first to understand then to be understood6 - synergy7 - sharpen the sawWisdom for life Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/Wisdom-For-L...Check out my blog: https://russjamieson.comHaving issues with shyness and social anxiety?https://socialanxietymentor.com/",

            "description": "Support Better Than Yesterday:https://www.buymeacoffee.com/uQKkXCF6BHow To Fix Your Sleep Schedule - Reset Your Sleep Pattern (animated)A common approach to resetting your sleep, is to pull an all-nighter. Basically you don't sleep for one day, and you go to bed at the desired time the next day.However that's like putting a band-aid on a bigger problem. It's also one of the worst things you can do for your health, even if the end goal is a healthy sleep schedule.Rather than pulling an all-nighter, you should focus on fixing your sleep habits.It's good to to understand how your body knows when it's time to wake up or go to sleep. There are two factors that regulate this and I'll talk about them in this video. You'll also get some actionable tips at the end.#fixsleep #resetsleep #sleepbetter",

            "description": "Support Better Than Yesterday:https://www.buymeacoffee.com/uQKkXCF6BOne Way To Find Out How Much Sleep You Actually Need (animated)One of the problems in today's society is that we're purposely getting less sleep than our bodies need. Usually it's because we have to go to work, or go to school. And this is bad, as we're sacrificing our health in return. Because of that, getting enough sleep can be a huge hidden advantage for you. Imagine having your brain function more efficiently than of those around you. That's what the right amount of sleep will get you. Better mood, better focus, ability to think clearly etc.But getting sufficient sleep for just one night isn't enough. You need to get enough sleep every single night to reap these benefits.Now you might be wondering, exactly how much sleep should you be getting.The standard prescription is 7-9 hours, but how do you know where exactly you personally fall in that range?First you need to understand that you, as an individual, are completely unique.And the amount of sleep your body requires also depends on many different external factors.That means there isn't an exact amount of sleep you should be getting, as the amount actually changes from day to day.In this video I'll explain how to find out, how much sleep YOU PERSONALLY need.#sleep #betterthanyesterday #health",

            "description": "In recent times, music lovers have been confounded with the tragic and shocking news that some of their most beloved stars had passed away in controversial circumstances. The music world has again been stunned by the sudden and tragic news that Prince, the legendary musician, died at his home in Minneapolis at the age of just 57, and it was recently confirmed the singer died of an opioid overdose. He was one of the most naturally gifted artists of all time, and also one of the most mysterious. In the Eighties, at a time when other megastars such as Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, and Madonna, were delivering an album every three years or so, Prince remained prolific to an almost inhuman degree. A byproduct of his inexhaustible output was Prince's tendency toward wayward, self-indulgent career moves that sometimes alienated even his most ardent supporters. His influence is unparalleled, and his legacy will live on through his inspirational music. In this fascinating documentary, we take an in depth look into the life and times of one of music\u2019s greatest performers\u2026Prince.",

            "description": "WHO ARE THE MOST EVIL KIDS?You\u2019ve probably heard the saying, \u201cKids can be so cruel,\u201d which is usually in reference to schoolyard bullying. It might also relate to such things as young kids pulling the legs off spiders. Psychologists tell us one of the reasons for such cruelty, especially against animals, is that children have not fully developed their sense of empathy. Sometimes they just don\u2019t understand the gravity of their actions. But then older kids should know better. Psychologists also tell us older kids that tend to be evil might have suffered from abusive relationships. They might also just be little psychopaths in the making, domineering devils with an anti-social attitude, and sometimes it seems there\u2019s no rational explanation why they are they way they are.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

You are a special case indeed, and there will be no contact or cuddles with other people for as long as you live. You\u2019ll never feel the touch of another person\u2019s skin...not even your own mother\u2019s.

            "description": "Whatever you need a website for, create yours today with Wix: https://www.wix.com/go/infographics What are some of the most disturbing wikipedia pages? As you probably know, a wiki is a website which consists of collaborations of people modifying content. The most popular of these sites is none other than Wikipedia. It was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. The former once said, \u201cImagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.\u201d And they did a good job. You can find 301 languages on Wikipedia, but the English language version is easily the biggest. Right now, in English you can find 5.7 million articles, and 46 million pages, which have been edited 860 million times and looked at by 1,203 admins. It\u2019s not surprising then, that there\u2019s some weird stuff you can find on Wikipedia. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll look at today, in this episode of the Infographics Show, the Scariest Wikipedia articles.SUBSCRIBE TO US -\u25ba http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SOCIAL:Twitter........\u25ba https://twitter.com/TheInfoShowSubreddit...\u25ba http://reddit.com/r/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources for this episode:https://pastebin.com/h5BkqGpx",

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Colorful Animation 4\" \"Seaweed\"And from Kevin MacLeod \"Marty Gots a Plan\"This is an educational video about the science of water quality.",

They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.Get a signed shade ball by supporting Veritasium: https://ve42.co/patreonReceiving a shade ball:1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiersMy sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them.

            "description": "When you look at the seas and oceans on the map you might think that they just flow into each other. It seems like there\u2019s only one big ocean, and people just gave different names to its parts. Well, you\u2019ll be amazed at how vivid the borders between them are!The border between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is like a line between 2 worlds. It looks as if the two oceans meet at an invisible wall which does not let them flow into each other and mix their waters. Why on Earth does it happen? We know for sure there is no invisible wall inside, and water is water. So what could interfere with its mixing?Other videos you might like:If You See Square Waves, Get Out of the Water! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWdb5...What Would a Trip to the Mariana Trench Be Like? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeW1D...It Takes Hundreds of Lives a Year, But Only 5% Know About It https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IFa...TIMESTAMPS:Water can be different too! 0:40What are haloclines? 1:03The most spectacular clines on the planet:- The North and Baltic Seas 4:38- The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean 5:04- The Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean 5:16- The Surinam River and the Atlantic Ocean 5:36- The Uruguay River and its afflux 5:43- The Rio Negro and Solim\u00f5es Rivers 5:58- Mosel and Rhein 6:19- Ilz, Danube, and Inn 6:30- Alaknanda and Bhagirathi Rivers 6:48- Irtysh and Ulba 6:56- The Jialing and Yangtze Rivers 7:11- Irtysh and Om 7:20- Chuya and Katun rivers 7:20- The Green and Colorado rivers 7:50- The Rhone and Arve rivers 8:10#oceans #rivers #brightsideSUMMARY:- Pacific oceans have different density and chemical make-up, the level of salinity and other qualities. One can see by their color that they are far from being the same.- Haloclines \u2013 borders between waters with different salinity \u2013 are the most spectacular, and this is what we see when the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans meet. - Haloclines appear when water in one ocean or sea is at least 5 times saltier than in the other. - Another important difference between the two oceans' water is the strength of molecules' connection, or surface tensile strength. - Maybe they could gradually start mixing with time, but as the flows in them have opposite directions, they just don\u2019t have time to do this.- There are also thermoclines \u2013 borders between water of different temperatures, like the warm water of Gulf Stream and much colder North Atlantic Ocean. - The North and Baltic Seas meet near the Danish city of Skagen. The water in them does not mix because of different density. - The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean meet at the Strait of Gibraltar and have a different density and salinity, so their water does not mix too.- The Uruguay River and its afflux meet in Misiones province in Argentina. One of them is cleaned to be used in agriculture, and the other gets almost red because of loam during rainy seasons.- Mosel and Rhein meet in Koblenz, Germany. Rheine has lighter water and Mosel \u2013 darker. - Alaknanda and Bhagirathi Rivers meet in India. Alaknanda is dark and Bhagirathi is light. - The Jialing and Yangtze Rivers meet in Chongqing, China. The Jialing is clean and the Yangtze is brown.- The water of the Chuya has an unusual cloudy white color here and looks dense and thick. Katun is clean and turquoise. Flowing into each other they form a single two-colored flow that does not mix for some time. - The Rhone and Arve rivers flow into each other in Geneva, Switzerland. The Rhone is a pure river that flows out of the lake of Geneva, the Arve is cloudy as it gets its water from glaciers of the Chamonix valley.

            "description": "The world's roundest object helps solve the longest running problem in measurement -- how to define the kilogram.Support Veritasium on Patreon: http://bit.ly/VePatreonA kilogram isn't what it used to be. Literally. The original name for it was the 'grave', proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.But the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn't seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.The Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro's constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro's constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro's constant.Special thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help. Thanks also to Nessy Hill for filming and reviewing earlier drafts of this video.There is debate as to whether this is truly the roundest object ever created. The Gravity Probe-B rotors are also spherical with very low tolerances such that they may in fact be rounder.Music by Kevin McLeod (incompetech.com) Decision, Danse Macabre, Scissors",

I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.Additional resources and references:The Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Mediumhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftapeWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",

As an aside, the Utah constitution from 1895 required the metric system to be taught in schools. This requirement was repealed in 1987. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afHuge thanks to NIST, Ben Stein and Patrick Abbott.https://www.nist.gov/https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-...Special thanks to Patreon Supporters:Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan HansenBack in 1875 The US signed the Metre Convention, which basically committed the country to use the metric system. In return, French scientists sent two platinum-iridium cylinders that weigh 1kg to the US in 1889 (known by their designations K4 and K20 from a set of 40 identical objects that were produced and sent around the world). So even though everything you see and buy in the US is usually reported in pounds, all weights are traceable back to the K20 kilogram (by applying a conversion factor to get to pounds).When I was in DC a few weeks ago, I visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and got up close with K20, which is still kept there and used to calibrate all mass standards in this country. I thought it was pretty cool.Edited by Bill Connor",

They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.Get a signed shade ball by supporting Veritasium: https://ve42.co/patreonReceiving a shade ball:1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiersMy sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.Huge thanks to:Jordan Schnabel and Cristian Carretero for filming and swimming and providing lifeguard services.Raquel Nuno for filming and putting up with me.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Music from https://epidemicsound.com \"Dubstep Mammoth 2\" \"Finally Here (Instrumental)\" \"The Last Arrival\" \"Sundown Love (Instrumental)\"",

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Colorful Animation 4\" \"Seaweed\"And from Kevin MacLeod \"Marty Gots a Plan\"This is an educational video about the science of water quality.",

The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.comAerogel\u2019s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by \u2018drying out insects\u2019 reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.Special thanks to all my Patreon supporters especially those who contributed feedback to an earlier draft of this video:a human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzezi\u0144ski, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick \u010calija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252Filmed by Paul GramagliaThumbnail by Ignat BerbeciAnimations by Catherine ChooljianMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \u201cTonic Zone\u201d \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d \u201cInsidious Mice\u201d \u201cSeaweed\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious\u201d \u201cPlatin00m - Sum It\u201dThis is an educational, scientific video.",

            "description": "My hypothesis is that the algorithm, rather than viewer preference, drives views on the site. As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",

            "description": "I took a boat through 96 million black plastic balls on the Los Angeles reservoir to find out why they're there. The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Colorful Animation 4\" \"Seaweed\"And from Kevin MacLeod \"Marty Gots a Plan\"This is an educational video about the science of water quality.",

This video was sponsored by B&H Photo: https://www.bhphotovideo.comHuge thanks to:Richard Diehl, Video Labguy https://www.youtube.com/user/videolabguyhttps://www.labguysworld.comBranch Education for awesome animationshttps://ve42.co/BranchEdMinutephysics for mechanical TV animationshttps://www.youtube.com/minutephysicsMark SchubinEngineer and explainer, SMPTE Life Fellowhttps://www.smpte.orgThis is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.Additional resources and references:The Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Mediumhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftapeWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.Get a signed shade ball by supporting Veritasium: https://ve42.co/patreonReceiving a shade ball:1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiersMy sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.Huge thanks to:Jordan Schnabel and Cristian Carretero for filming and swimming and providing lifeguard services.Raquel Nuno for filming and putting up with me.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Music from https://epidemicsound.com \"Dubstep Mammoth 2\" \"Finally Here (Instrumental)\" \"The Last Arrival\" \"Sundown Love (Instrumental)\"",

We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iv\u00e1n TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",

            "description": "As a Canadian-Australian, I have always wondered why it is that Australia has so many venomous animals that can kill you while Canada has virtually none.Subscribe to Veritasium - it's free! http://bit.ly/YSWpWmBut it's not just Australia - it seems like all beautiful, warm places are cursed with venomous native species. So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?I asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally \"sit and wait\" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.Special thanks to Prof. Rick Shine, Prof. Dieter Hochuli, Prof. Roger Lowe, Prof. Martyn Poliakoff and Taronga Zoo, especially Joe Haddock and Dean Purcell.Cinematography by Charles Clement",

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",

These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic.

            "description": "A bisected grape in the microwave makes plasma. But how does it work? A grape is the right size and refractive index to trap microwaves inside it. When you place two (or two halves) close together the fields interact with each other creating a maximum of electromagnetic energy where they touch. This creates heating, sparks, and plasma, which is further fed with energy directly by the microwaves.Huge thanks to Hamza Khattak, Prof. Pablo Bianucci and Prof. Aaron Slepkov (unavailable for the call) for chatting to me and helping me understand the physics of this cool phenomenon.Linking plasma formation in grapes to microwave resonances of aqueous dimershttps://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/...Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, James M Nicholson, Michael Krugman, Nathan Hansen, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance ShepherdThanks also to Steve Bosi, my original plasma collaborator.Animations by Alan ChamberlainMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Seaweed\"",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?Huge thanks to:Prof. Konstantin Batygin, CaltechProf. David Jewitt, UCLAI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.Special Thanks to Patreon Supporters:Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige ThormanMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Observations - From Now On\" \"Magnified XY\"",

It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.Notes about measuring radiation:Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.https://xkcd.com/radiation/DOSES MAY VARYThe level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).Estimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.The most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video.

To me this sounded like unsubstantiated rubbish, like the claim the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible from space. So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth. No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.I was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording. Now I wasn't consciously aware of the sound of my heart while in the room, but I was more aware of the feeling of it beating.Huge thank you to everyone at BYU: Duane Merrell, Spencer Perry, Cameron Vongsawad, Jazz Myers, Ann Clawson, and Robert Willes.",

In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.For more from Tim Urban, visit Wait But Why: http://www.waitbutwhy.com/Get TED Talks recommended just for you!

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement\u2014and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017.

For his talk, Joseph tells the story of how he witnessed the shotgun suicide of one his classmates. This experience was traumatic and life altering. His story however will not be focused on the pain or hardships this moment had on his life, but rather the good that has come out of it. Joseph hopes to share his moment in time with the world in order to raise awareness about the reality of mentally based hindrances, and spread the word about EMDR therapy.

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

It\u2019s literally impossible, to not be motivated if you implement this habit. We all struggle with motivation from time to time, it\u2019s not bad to admit this. But it is bad, to allow yourself to stay unmotivated. There are many people who talk about motivation, as if it\u2019s something that you get. But we have to realize, that motivation is just an emotion, and all emotions are transient, meaning they come and they go. So, you can rely on motivation, because it comes and it goes. Implementing this strategy will also force you to be self disciplined, because you really do have no other option. Want to learn how to Disciplined? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GqBx...",

Basically you don't sleep for one day, and you go to bed at the desired time the next day.However that's like putting a band-aid on a bigger problem. It's also one of the worst things you can do for your health, even if the end goal is a healthy sleep schedule.Rather than pulling an all-nighter, you should focus on fixing your sleep habits.It's good to to understand how your body knows when it's time to wake up or go to sleep. There are two factors that regulate this and I'll talk about them in this video. You'll also get some actionable tips at the end.#fixsleep #resetsleep #sleepbetter",

It's where I found out about The 2 Minute Rule.US: https://amzn.to/2nNYA1nEU: https://amzn.to/2miAV8LBreak Your Mental Resistance With The 2 Minute Rule (animated)Why is it so hard to follow up on our new habits?One of the reasons is that the habit we're trying to form can seem a little overwhelming, so we have this mental resistance.In the beginning, when we're super motivated it's much easier to do something. For example; going to the gym for 1 hour doesn't seem that hard, because the initial motivation is a powerful driving force.But when we're motivated it's also easy to impose some super high expectations on ourselves.We think: \"Ok, so I went to the gym for 1 hour the first few days. From now on I'll to go to the gym for 1 full hour every single day.\"But once that initial motivation fades away after a few days, there is now nothing that's driving us forward, and we haven't really formed a habit yet.That's why when we're unmotivated, we'll probably just skip gym altogether, as dedicating a whole hour to it seems daunting.So instead of relying on motivation to push us forward, we should focus on making our new habit, an actual habit.Let me explain what I mean, by introducing you to the 2 minute rule.",

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",

There are literally 1000's of success books out there, so why should this one be any different? Stephen Covey researched the last 200 years of success literature and found something interesting.. In the last 50 years, most of the books have been focused on the personality ethic - Things like public image, how you dress, how you perform in social interactions, positive mental attitude, skills and techniques to get people to behave in certain ways. These books focus on how to appear rather than how to actually be. The 7 habits of highly effective people takes an inside out approach \u2013 it focuses on the character ethic rather than the personality ethic.1 - be proactive2 - begin with the end in mind3 - put first things first4 - think win win 5 - seek first to understand then to be understood6 - synergy7 - sharpen the sawWisdom for life Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/Wisdom-For-L...Check out my blog: https://russjamieson.comHaving issues with shyness and social anxiety?https://socialanxietymentor.com/",

Basically you don't sleep for one day, and you go to bed at the desired time the next day.However that's like putting a band-aid on a bigger problem. It's also one of the worst things you can do for your health, even if the end goal is a healthy sleep schedule.Rather than pulling an all-nighter, you should focus on fixing your sleep habits.It's good to to understand how your body knows when it's time to wake up or go to sleep. There are two factors that regulate this and I'll talk about them in this video. You'll also get some actionable tips at the end.#fixsleep #resetsleep #sleepbetter",

            "description": "Support Better Than Yesterday:https://www.buymeacoffee.com/uQKkXCF6BOne Way To Find Out How Much Sleep You Actually Need (animated)One of the problems in today's society is that we're purposely getting less sleep than our bodies need. Usually it's because we have to go to work, or go to school. And this is bad, as we're sacrificing our health in return. Because of that, getting enough sleep can be a huge hidden advantage for you. Imagine having your brain function more efficiently than of those around you. That's what the right amount of sleep will get you. Better mood, better focus, ability to think clearly etc.But getting sufficient sleep for just one night isn't enough. You need to get enough sleep every single night to reap these benefits.Now you might be wondering, exactly how much sleep should you be getting.The standard prescription is 7-9 hours, but how do you know where exactly you personally fall in that range?First you need to understand that you, as an individual, are completely unique.And the amount of sleep your body requires also depends on many different external factors.That means there isn't an exact amount of sleep you should be getting, as the amount actually changes from day to day.In this video I'll explain how to find out, how much sleep YOU PERSONALLY need.#sleep #betterthanyesterday #health",

            "description": "Scientists like Prof Sinclair have evidence of speeding up, slowing, and even reversing aging. Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLPWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.Special thanks to:Professor David Sinclair, check out his book \"Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To\"Assistant Professor David GoldNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)Genepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortalEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tvAnimation: Etsuko UnoArt and Technical Direction: Drew BerrySound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma BortignonScientific Consultation: Marnie BlewittCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical ResearchFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek MullerMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Clearer Views\" \"Innovations\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"Additional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.com \"Marty Gots a Plan\"",

            "description": "My hypothesis is that the algorithm, rather than viewer preference, drives views on the site. As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'Code for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Quantum...I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iv\u00e1n TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.Music from https://epidemicsound.com \"The Longest Rest\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"",

What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?Huge thanks to:Prof. Konstantin Batygin, CaltechProf. David Jewitt, UCLAI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.Special Thanks to Patreon Supporters:Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige ThormanMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Observations - From Now On\" \"Magnified XY\"",

Quantum Gravity Research is a Los Angeles based team of mathematicians and physicists working on developing a theoretical framework for a first-principles unified quantum gravity theory they call emergence theory. Still in the early stage of development, emergence theory attempts to unify, through mathematical and scientific rigor, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness.This film is presented in layperson terms and explains basics tenets of emergence theory, quantum mechanics and digital physics in ways that are meant to be communicative and fun. However, if you'd like to read any of the scientific and more technical papers, please visit our website.Now ENJOY THE MOVIE! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~QGR\u2019S WEBSITE: http://www.quantumgravityresearch.org/ QGR\u2019S BLOG: http://www.quantumgravityresearch.org...

On this episode of Health Theory with Tom Bilyeu, David Sinclair explains the three levels of aging, and what can be done on each level. He describes the lifestyle changes that slow aging down, the drug treatments that begin to stop aging, and experimental new procedures that may actually reverse aging once they are fully developed.SHOW NOTES:David explains the information theory of aging [0:59]David explains the difference between genes and the epigenome [2:17]David describes the way that cell stress causes aging [5:20]David explains what proteins are and how they work [6:40]David recommends lifestyle changes to slow down or reverse aging [9:14]David recommends stressing the system by consistent fasting [10:52]David explains why we don\u2019t live as long as whales [15:01]David describes resetting the biological clock [16:16]David explains how to tell when someone is going to die [18:47]David explains why people are taking metformin [20:03]David shares his regimen of exercise and metformin [24:18]David advocates cold exposure [25:28]David explains work he\u2019s done to try to reset the aging clock [29:01]David explains why you don\u2019t want to turn the cellular clock back too far [31:37]David describes the actual process of reversing aging in masses of cells [33:20]David talks about some results with mice that appear to reverse aging [36:40]David shares his father\u2019s story of metformin and NMN use [38:10]David explains the effects of resveratrol [39:07]David describes the kinds of testing he advocates [43:13]David shares the impact he wants to have on the world [45:44]FOLLOW DAVID:WEBSITE: www.lifespanbook.comINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/2kPvLjFFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2mcAPiqTWITTER: @IMPACT THEORY MERCHANDISE: Check out Impact Theory's Merch Shop: http://bit.ly/ImpactTheoryShop",

Hof has set out to spread the potential health benefits of his breathing techniques, working closely with scientists around the world to prove that the Wim Hof Method works. It is thought from current studies that by consciously hyperventilating Wim can increase his heart rate, adrenalin levels and blood alkalinity. To learn more about the Wim Hof Method check out: http://www.wimhofmethod.com \u2764 HELP TRANSLATE THIS VIDEO \u2764If you loved this video, help people in other countries enjoy it too by making captions for it. Spread the love and impact. https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_vid...\u2714 Warning: The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practice the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you\u2019ve fainted, it means that you went to far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practiced responsible, there is a risk of hypothermia. Do not practice the method during pregnancy or when having epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method.Source: wimhofmethod.com\u2605 MORE RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU \u2605If you enjoyed this video, you may enjoy these other videos from Evan Carmichael:\u2022 Warren Buffett's Top 10 Rules For Success - https://youtu.be/iEgu6p_frmE\u2022 Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki's Top 10 Rules For Success - https://youtu.be/yVfBdFs4_S8\u2022 Bob Proctor's Top 10 Rules For Success - https://youtu.be/uLn6lpP8YmA\u265b BUY MY BOOK, CHANGE YOUR LIFE  \u265bSome used the ideas in this book to build multi-billion-dollar businesses.

[45:42]QUOTES:\u201cWhen we say unleashing human potential it is not about reaching the peak. It is a trajectory.\u201d [5:04]\u201cIf you are a little sensitive to life you will realize you\u2019re the biggest issue in your life.\u201d [7:12]\u201cIf you have the fear of falling down and suffering you will not go very high. [11:45]\u201cThe privileges of the nature of your experience must be in your hand.\u201d [12:43]\u201cA child is not a legacy. It\u2019s a life. And it\u2019s an individual life. It has to be what it has to be.\u201d [15:37]\u201cDeath is a closure. Life is a possibility.\u201d [26:36]\u201cYour experience is entirely determined by you.\u201d [29:15]\u201cOnly when your attention and involvement is indiscriminate does the universe open up to you.\u201d [31:30]\u201cThe content of our life will not change our life. It is the context of our life which changes our life.\u201d [43:55]\u201cThis, this is a living cosmos. Everybody's free to capture as much as they want. If you capture a substantial amount of life, your very presence will become a significant life. Otherwise, you will become a mediocre life. This is the important thing. It's not the knowledge you gather in your head. It's not the muscle that you gather in your body.
