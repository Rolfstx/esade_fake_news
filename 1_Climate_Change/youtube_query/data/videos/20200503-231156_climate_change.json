But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.
