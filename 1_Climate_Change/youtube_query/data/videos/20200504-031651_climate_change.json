I\u2019m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I\u2019m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, \u201cWhat has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?\u201d  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.

            "description": "Why do we like what we like? Raymond Loewy, the father of industrial design, had a theory. He was the all-star 20th-century designer of the Coca-Cola fountain and Lucky Strike pack; the modern sports car, locomotive, Greyhound bus and tractor; the interior of the first NASA spaceship; and the egg-shaped pencil sharpener. How did one man understand what consumers wanted from so many different areas of life? His grand theory of popularity was called MAYA: Most advanced yet acceptable. He said humans are torn between two opposing forces: neophilia, a love of new things; and neophobia; a fear of anything that\u2019s too new. Hits, he said, live at the perfect intersection of novelty and familiarity. They are familiar surprises. In this talk, I\u2019ll explain how Loewy\u2019s theory has been validated by hundreds of years of research \u2014 and how we can all use it to make hits.  Derek Thompson is a senior editor at The Atlantic, where he writes about economics, technology and media. He is a news analyst with NPR's afternoon show \u201cHere and Now,\" appearing weekly on Mondays, and an on-air contributor to CBS News. The recipient of several honors, including the 2016 Best in Business award for Columns and Commentary from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, he is the author of the national bestselling book Hit Makers: How to Succeed in an Age of Distraction.

Outstanding speaker Conor Neill from IESE Business School illustrates how to self apply the three criteria Warren Buffett uses to choose the people in which he trusts with his investments.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

            "description": "With comedy, you not only laugh but you also gain understanding in a unique way. Comedy has a setup and then a punch line. The setup moves the audience in one direction-toward what is expected. The punch line occurs when you change direction and take the audience to the unexpected. This same process can be applied to life. Comedian Michael Jr. shows how to take your life's setups and then change direction in a way that brings fulfillment, revelation, and joy not only to you but also to those around you.Once in a generation, a comedian comes along who speaks to everyone. Today, that comedian is known simply as Michael Jr.Watch him onstage and you\u2019ll see a man at ease\u2026with himself, his audience, and his message. Listen to his voice and you\u2019ll detect a comfortable, conversational style that hides a sly sense of mischief. Hear his words and you\u2019ll laugh at the universal themes that connect us all.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

            "description": "At 14-years-old, Christian Picciolini went from naive teenager to white supremacist, and soon, the leader of America\u2019s first neo-Nazi skinhead gang. How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement\u2014and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017. Christian lives in Chicago. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

Outstanding speaker Conor Neill from IESE Business School illustrates how to self apply the three criteria Warren Buffett uses to choose the people in which he trusts with his investments.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

They often carry infectious diseases like E. Coli and Salmonella and gnaw on infrastructure, causing billions of dollars in damage every year. But is any of this the rat's fault? Rodentologist Bobby Corrigan says that rats can only succeed in the midst of human failure. If we were smarter mammals, better at disposing our trash and taking care of our infrastructure, then we wouldn't have to worry about rats in our cities.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

How did we land on that concept of extraterrestrials?Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjONo one really knows what aliens look like, but we all have similar ideas about them. It\u2019s often a creature with a big head, long arms and legs, and big buggy eyes. We see these common images of aliens depicted in movies, books, and on TV shows\u2014which are made by us.Science fiction stories often explore the relationship between humans and aliens. So we often find extraterrestrial creatures entangled with relatable human features. In this video, we talk to Oscar-nominated VFX supervisor Charley Henley, and the director of SETI Research Center at UC Berkely, Andrew Siemion. They both give us their views on how we, humans, perceive aliens and how that shapes our imagination of life beyond our planet.You can read more about SETI\u2019s work here: http://seti.berkeley.eduYou can see the full VFX breakdown of MPC\u2019s work on Alien: Covenant here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t-8n...

            "description": "North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim\u2019s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator\u2019s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it\u2019s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?\"People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,\" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn\u2019t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that \"The Greed Program,\" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.Check out our web special:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/greed/s-32898_______Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

            "description": "The life and struggles of King Hussein of Jordan, from the assassination of his grandfather to the rise of the PLO.This two-part series is the story of Jordan's king from 1952 to 1999, a major political figure in the cauldron of the Middle East and one whose life and career were never far from a crisis, at home and abroad. Hussein was still only fifteen when his grandfather, King Abdullah I, was shot dead by a Palestinian gunman in July 1951 with the boy by his side at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Hussein\u2019s father, Talal, became king but was forced to abdicate for health reasons after only a year in power, in August 1952; and the sixteen-year-old Crown Prince acceded to the throne, under a Regency Council until he came of age. He then faced a series of political crises, domestically and in his dealings with Israel. As King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, he took over the country at a time of huge uncertainty. He inherited the Anglo-Jordanian treaty with the British from his grandfather - but also had to deal with the fall-out from the 1948 war and foundation of Israel when the West Bank and East Jerusalem were annexed to Jordan, along with their Palestinian populations. Hussein\u2019s supporters regarded him as the father of modern Jordan, the man who guided his country through dangerous times and kept the Hashemite dynasty in power at a time when the Egyptian, Iraqi and Libyan monarchies had all fallen. But Jordanian opposition parties, particularly the Communists, were against the monarchy. The communist party won a parliamentary majority in 1956 but a year later Hussein dismissed the Prime Minister, ended multi-party rule and imprisoned or exiled his opponents. During his 46-year reign, the country\u2019s industry and infrastructure certainly grew and were modernised \u2013 and living standards and literacy among ordinary Jordanians steadily improved. But internationally he polarises opinion. In parts of the Arab world, he\u2019s accused of selling out to the British, Americans and Israeli Zionists. His highest profile critic was arguably Egypt\u2019s nationalist President Nasser who had himself overthrown King Faroukh. The two were often at loggerheads. Jordan joined Egypt and Syria in the Six Day War with Israel in 1967 in which Hussein lost the whole of the West Bank and saw his military decimated. He then refused to join Syria and Egypt in the retaliatory October War in 1973, even tipping off Golda Meir that an Arab attack was imminent. Hussein\u2019s relationship with the Palestinians was also difficult. After the 1967 loss of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they never felt he was able to protect them; and in 1970 he expelled the PLO from Jordan.  Hussein is thought to have conducted secret talks with Israel over a thirty year period, resulting in the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace in 1994; and his relationship with Yitzhak Rabin was so close, he spoke at Rabin's funeral. His relationship with the West was also extremely close - and in 1977 the Washington Post alleged he had such strong ties with the CIA that even received a monthly salary from the agency. In February 1999, Hussein lost his seven-year battle against cancer. He was a colourful and controversial personality, a trained and daring pilot, with an eventful personal life. He had four marriages, the latter to the American-born Lisa Hallaby, Queen Noor, his wife for 21 years until his death. His critics described him as an artful opportunist, cynically shifting alliances with the sole aim of staying in power. An Israeli intelligence report once described him as a man trapped on a bridge burning at both ends, spanning a crocodile-infested river. He was certainly an arch politician who navigated the minefield of the Middle East all his political life but never lost faith in the peace process. In his last major TV interview he said he believed that peace would eventually be reached in the Arab-Israeli conflict although, of course, almost two decades later, that peace is still proving as elusive as ever.More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribe",

            "description": "The current crisis in Yemen, a country crippled by war, took a dramatic turn on December 4 with the assassination of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh by Houthi rebels. But the political and sectarian divisions that dominate Yemen today - and which ultimately led to Saleh's death - go back hundreds of years.When Islam came to Yemen, the Zaidis, a Shia Islamic sect, became dominant in the north, and its imams were in full control there by the 9th century. The Shia presence would remain in the north for the next thousand years.After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the northern kingdom of Yemen was ruled by a Shia imam while the south of Yemen remained divided, run by different local sultanates - until the British eventually established their own southern state, the Federation of South Arabia.North Yemen became a republic in 1962 but it was not until 1967 that the British colonial rule ended in the south and The People's Republic of South Yemen was formed, with Qahtan al-Shaabi as its president.Independence did not stop the southern infighting. The National Liberation Front took power in 1969 and formed a Marxist republic, leaning heavily on support from the Soviet Union. The push-pull between north and south also continued.Some analysts now see this as tension part of the slow process towards the eventual unification of the two halves of Yemen.\"The conflict between the north and south has always been about Yemen's unity, the 1972 and 1979 wars,\" explains journalist and historian Abd al-Bari Taher. \"Those two wars between the north and south were all about achieving Yemeni unity.\"More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribe#AlJazeeraEnglish #YemenDivide #AlJazeeraWorld",

Yemen is now on the brink of the world\u2019s worst famine. It\u2019s a stark contrast from the abstract game of political chess that is unfolding abroad: The Saudi crown prince is drumming up support in the US, France is blaming Iran for arming Yemen\u2019s Houthi militia, and Iran is blaming Britain for arming the Saudi-led bombing campaign. Meanwhile, there is no headway in the UN peace efforts.Produced by Daniel BARNEY, Alessandro XENOS, Van MEGUERDITCHIAN.http://www.france24.com/en/taxonomy/e...Visit our website:http://www.france24.comSubscribe to our YouTube channel:http://f24.my/youtubeENLike us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/FRANCE24.Eng...Follow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/France24_en",

We were sipping cocktails in the art-deco building with string theorist and science superstar Robbert Dijkgraaf as he told us all about the fundamental laws of Nature. Afterwards, cellist and composer Benjamin Glorieux performed a musical piece together with invited guests especially commissioned for the occasion, while live-video artist Klaas Verpoest accompanied them with his visual magic.What is string theory? What happens to stuff that falls inside a black hole? What are the fundamental building blocks of space and time? Did Nature have any choice in picking the fundamental laws of physics? What is the role of mathematics in physics?This talk by professor Robbert Dijkgraaf was recorded on 13 July 2019 at Flagey in Brussels.
