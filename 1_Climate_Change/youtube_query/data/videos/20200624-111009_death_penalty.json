For about six years during the 1940s, Maybelle Carter and her young daughters \u2013 Helen, June and Anita \u2013 set roots in central Virginia. In 1946, they saw their popularity explode when they landed a spot with Richmond's biggest radio station \u2013 WRVA \u2013 and its premier stage for hillbilly fun. The family moved to Henrico in 1947, buying a two-story home on what used to be Mountain Road.",

He got friend Curtis Wayne Wright Jr., 51, to do it, and this killer got another man, Jimmy Ray Rodgers, 29, to help, prosecutors said. Wright and Rodgers ambushed the victim while she was supposed to be home alone one day in 2015 after she returned early from a family vacation, authorities said.As far as prosecutors is concerned, Mark Sievers is the last man they have to take down to get justice for Dr. Sievers. Wright flipped, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, and agreed to testify against his alleged co-conspirators. He testified against Rodgers, who was charged with first-degree murder, and convicted of second-degree murder last month. This defendant was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and trespassing.READ MORE: https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/l...#SieversTrial #MarkSievers #DrTeresaSievers",

PART ONE: THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDERIf you had to choose between (1) killing one person to save the lives of five others and (2) doing nothing even though you knew that five people would die right before your eyes if you did nothing\u2014what would you do?  What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums\u2014each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. PART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISMSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism\u2014and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces \"the greatest good for the greatest number.\"",

            "description": "CARLISLE, Ohio (WKRC) - Brooke Skylar Richardson had a promising future. The 18-year-old graduated from Carlisle High School and she was headed to the University of Cincinnati to study in the Fall.Many who knew her are still trying to wrap their heads around what happened. Kasey Isaacs graduated two years before Richardson. \"She was a pretty decent girl from what I saw on school. She didn't really bother anybody. It's crazy,\" Isaacs said. Friday, a grand jury indicted Richardson. She faces charges of aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, endangering children, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse.Richardson was previously charged with reckless homicide in the case. Investigators found bones buried at the property on Eagle Ridge Drive in July. They initially thought they were those of a stillborn baby that had been buried 10-12 weeks before they were discovered.\"I'm currently pregnant and I could not put myself in her shoes. There's no way. I just couldn't,\" said Isaacs.Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell says Richardson gave birth in early May at the family home on Eagle Ridge, killing the baby shortly afterwards. On July 14th, after getting a tip, investigators found the remains burned and buried behind the family's Carlisle home. Originally, investigators believed the remains were of a stillborn, but the prosecutor says testing showed that the baby was born alive.\"I didn't expect this really at all especially around here. It was a definite shocked to see all of the police and all of the news crews come up and then all of the information that got released. It came as a great shock and it's very disturbing,\" said neighbor Sam Jeffries, who is familiar with the family.The prosecutor says more will come out after the trial. As for a motive, he believes from Richardson's perspective, keeping the baby was not an option.\"Skylar and her family, particularly her mother, were pretty obsessed with external appearances and how things appear to the outside world and you have a situation where she's a cute, recent graduate. She was a cheerleader, a described 'good girl' by her attorney,\" said Fornshell.Richardson is expected in court on Monday. The prosecutor says he will likely seek a high bond considering the seriousness of the charges. The prosecutor did have the option of seeking the death penalty, but has chosen not to in this case.",

And the new responsibilities in her approaching adulthood are symbolized by the making of her first dress. This rite of passage for a young Mennonite girl is recounted by Hollie's mother Deborah, whose own mother helped her cut and sew her first dress at 15, as she describes their community\u2019s traditions of dressmaking.Through the story of Hollie's first dress, we see a Mennonite mother passing family values and community traditions to her daughter that will shape the decisions she must make in her future. Will she choose to be a wife and mother and remain in the community or forge her own path?More Shows:http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-WatchMoreStay Connected:Twitter: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-TwitterFacebook: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-FacebookInstagram: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-Instagram",

The speaker makes assertions about a specific diet that lack sufficient scientific evidence for general prescription. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...Dr. Barnard has led numerous research studies investigating the effects of diet on diabetes, body weight, and chronic pain, including a groundbreaking study of dietary interventions in type 2 diabetes, funded by the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Barnard has authored over 70 scientific publications as well as 17 books.  As president of the Physicians Committee, Dr. Barnard leads programs advocating for preventive medicine, good nutrition, and higher ethical standards in research. He has hosted three PBS television programs on nutrition and health and is frequently called on by news programs to discuss issues related to nutrition and research.  Originally from Fargo, North Dakota, Dr. Barnard received his M.D. degree at the George Washington University School of Medicine and completed his residency at the same institution. He practiced at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in New York before returning to Washington to found the Physicians Committee.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
