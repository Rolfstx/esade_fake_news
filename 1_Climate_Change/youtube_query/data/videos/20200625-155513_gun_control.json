With billions of fans scheduled to tune into the upcoming 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hasan examines how the game has evolved from a sport of British colonizers into a tool of diplomacy and a force for good despite recent scandals and corruption. Hasan also explores how cricket has especially grown in India due in part to the creation of the IPL, a flashy professional cricket league founded by the infamous Lalit Modi, and how that expansion has unfortunately come at the expense of the growth of cricket in other countries.Watch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931 #Netflix #PatriotAct #HasanMinhajSubscribe: https://bit.ly/2OHQXpOAbout Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj:New episodes, new topics, every Sunday - only on Netflix.

He's my oldest friend, and when we were at school together, we hid a dictaphone in the classroom ceiling to confuse our teacher. 18:25 - This is the cushion that I used to carry my pet owl around on. I would have brought the owl, but he escaped last week. 23:45 - For five days I pushed my cat around in a pram, because it had sprained three of its ankles. 26:27 - As a teenager, I used to terrorise my neighbourhood with a game I invented called \"Theft and Shrubbery\". 31:45 - This is Michael, and after cutting his hair, I got a job on a campsite as a hairdresser. 37:54 - I have a digeridoo suspended from a tree in my back garden so when the wind blows in a certain direction, it parps soothing sounds of the outback through my bedroom window. 41:34 - I recently had to charm a spider out of my shoe by tooting a flute at it. 45:35 - I can break an apple in half with my bare hands.A huge thanks to the person who contributed the Swedish subtitles for the entire compilation!And to the person who contributed the Russian subtitles for the entire compilation! This is simply amazing.",

He's my oldest friend, and when we were at school together, we hid a dictaphone in the classroom ceiling to confuse our teacher. 18:25 - This is the cushion that I used to carry my pet owl around on. I would have brought the owl, but he escaped last week. 23:45 - For five days I pushed my cat around in a pram, because it had sprained three of its ankles. 26:27 - As a teenager, I used to terrorise my neighbourhood with a game I invented called \"Theft and Shrubbery\". 31:45 - This is Michael, and after cutting his hair, I got a job on a campsite as a hairdresser. 37:54 - I have a digeridoo suspended from a tree in my back garden so when the wind blows in a certain direction, it parps soothing sounds of the outback through my bedroom window. 41:34 - I recently had to charm a spider out of my shoe by tooting a flute at it. 45:35 - I can break an apple in half with my bare hands.A huge thanks to the person who contributed the Swedish subtitles for the entire compilation!And to the person who contributed the Russian subtitles for the entire compilation! This is simply amazing.",

            "description": "Compilation of Bob Mortimer's stories on Would I Lie to You?00:07 -  I once set fire to my house with a box of fireworks. 06:50 - The police once ordered me to leave town because I was frightening the locals. 13:11 - This is Keith. He's my oldest friend, and when we were at school together, we hid a dictaphone in the classroom ceiling to confuse our teacher. 18:25 - This is the cushion that I used to carry my pet owl around on. I would have brought the owl, but he escaped last week. 23:45 - For five days I pushed my cat around in a pram, because it had sprained three of its ankles. 26:27 - As a teenager, I used to terrorise my neighbourhood with a game I invented called \"Theft and Shrubbery\". 31:45 - This is Michael, and after cutting his hair, I got a job on a campsite as a hairdresser. 37:54 - I have a digeridoo suspended from a tree in my back garden so when the wind blows in a certain direction, it parps soothing sounds of the outback through my bedroom window. 41:34 - I recently had to charm a spider out of my shoe by tooting a flute at it. 45:35 - I can break an apple in half with my bare hands.A huge thanks to the person who contributed the Swedish subtitles for the entire compilation!And to the person who contributed the Russian subtitles for the entire compilation! This is simply amazing.",

Here is a tribute to this legendary humorist we all know!Awesome Bill!Also if you love Bill Burr, you should check this video of Sugar Sammy roasting people:Sugar Sammy, Best improv moments, full show https://youtu.be/f8Sjpf4bJj4And Dave Chappelle best moments: https://youtu.be/6sv-oilMRGABill Burr was never an overnight sensation. It happened gradually. He\u2019s a comedian who has been so consistently hilarious, so consistently impassioned about his jokes, and so consistently on edge that after two decades, hardly anybody can remember a time when they didn\u2019t know Bill Burr.But that\u2019s not to say that he\u2019s never the subject of widespread media interest. In 2006, Bill Burr walked onto a stage in Philadelphia in front of an audience that had booed and jeered every comedian who had come up before him, and they treated him the same. That became his shining moment. Bill Burr unleashed a torrent of witty rage that was so glorious that even the angry, rowdy crowd set aside their own inane contempt to laugh in praise of the miracle that they had just witnessed. That moment was special because it defined Bill Burr.Since then, Burr has been busy as ever. He\u2019s produced a popular podcast (the Monday Morning Podcast), appeared in numerous movies and TV shows, and released four albums and comedy specials.Enjoy!\ud83d\udc49 Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/2phCdSU\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f Follow me on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2Wqea0k\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f See my channel and my over videos here: http://bit.ly/32U6gie",

            "description": "On April 4, 2009, William Lane Craig and Christopher Hitchens met at Biola University to debate the question of God\u2019s existence. Craig is one of the world\u2019s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the \u201cnew atheism\u201d movement. In front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ\u2019s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.",

Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

All music made specifically for this video by Producer Tom Fox. https://www.johnnyharris.tv/music At that link you can buy his music for your own videos if you want.This video explores how I organize pictures. You probably have more pictures than you know what to do with. Phones are amazing for taking lots of shots but often the result is too many photos. I have been thinking about how to organize photos for a really long time and this is my workflow to best remember your life by using photos. It uses cloud based storage between my phone and computer to help me see my photos often and it also uses some guiding concepts that help me delete more photos and better enjoy the ones I keep around. I hope this helps at least one person better remember their lives.

Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

            "description": "In this video I look at some of the most complex international border. Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

            "description": "In this video I look at some of the most complex international border. Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

Then I move onto the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border. Then I look at the exclaves of Germany within Belgium, the disputed border between India, Pakistan, and China.  Croatia has complex border with 2 of its neighbours - Serbia and Slovenia. I finish by looking at the minor border irregularity between Sweden and Finland.

As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh.

Lots of great stock for a very resonable price. Go get a free trial now!In this video, I look at the question: \"Do we really need time zones?\". Time zones cause a lot of problems, and in the last few years, some have called for them to be completely abolished, suggesting instead that the entire world shold just use the eact same time. I start this video by very briefly talking about how time zones came to be, before outlining some of the potential upside to a world without time zones... I finish the video off by looking at some of the difficulties of ditching time zones, arguing that actually, it's less complicated with time zones.",

Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

All music made specifically for this video by Producer Tom Fox. https://www.johnnyharris.tv/music At that link you can buy his music for your own videos if you want.This video explores how I organize pictures. You probably have more pictures than you know what to do with. Phones are amazing for taking lots of shots but often the result is too many photos. I have been thinking about how to organize photos for a really long time and this is my workflow to best remember your life by using photos. It uses cloud based storage between my phone and computer to help me see my photos often and it also uses some guiding concepts that help me delete more photos and better enjoy the ones I keep around. I hope this helps at least one person better remember their lives.

Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.

It uses an incredible amount of resources, emits toxic pollutants into the air, and pumps the ground full of formaldehyde, which is known to cause cancer. It's also prohibitively expensive. The average cost of a modern funeral costs between $10,000 to $12,000.There are a number of greener options available though. Cremation uses less resources and requires less space than a traditional burial, but isn't perfect. There are more experimental methods on the horizon  such as promession and alkaline hydrolysis. No matter which method we choose, it's clear that we need to reform how we bury the dead.Also be sure to read Mark Harris's excellent book about green burials http://www.gravematters.us",

The color of military uniforms, signs, vehicles, and world fashion spanning decades needs to be accounted for before even opening digital software like Photoshop. That means digging through sources like diaries, government records, old advertisements, and even consulting historical experts to get the colors right.But even after the arduous research, restoration, and blending of color, the image still isn\u2019t finished. In order to achieve true photorealism, the physics of how light works in the atmosphere needs to be taken into account. Colors look different depending on the lighting conditions when the photo was taken, so artists rely on shadows and the location of light to make an educated guess about the time of day in a black-and-white photo.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.But Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company \u2014 and viewers \u2014 demanded.Though the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But then he designed the set for I Love Lucy - the first of the multicam, laugh-track heavy sitcoms. Today, they look bland, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. But at the time, Freund had a good reason to tackle the challenge.These lighting techniques are still in use today on sitcoms like Friends, the Big Bang Theory, and other multi-camera hits. What looks generic to our eyes was, at one time, the result of an artist who made the impossible look easy.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I deeply love those gated reverb drums of the '80s - you know that punchy percussive sound popularized by Phil Collins and Prince? So for my second episode of Vox Pop\u2019s Earworm I spoke with two Berklee College of Music professors, Susan Rogers and Prince Charles Alexander, to figure out just how that sound came to be, what makes it so damn punchy, and why it\u2019s back.\u00a0Correction: At 2:01, a previous version of the video mistakenly said the noise gate only lets frequencies above a certain threshold pass through.

It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin. I spent some time exploring the living situation in Hong Kong to find out why housing has become so expensive and spaces so tight. To understand how Hong Kong\u2019s housing market turned out this way and see how it\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives, watch the final episode of Borders Hong Kong.

But then he designed the set for I Love Lucy - the first of the multicam, laugh-track heavy sitcoms. Today, they look bland, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. But at the time, Freund had a good reason to tackle the challenge.These lighting techniques are still in use today on sitcoms like Friends, the Big Bang Theory, and other multi-camera hits. What looks generic to our eyes was, at one time, the result of an artist who made the impossible look easy.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Likely he\u2019s a tenor, and more often than not he\u2019ll sing in falsetto. Think Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Drake, Charlie Puth, Shawn Mendes, Adam Levine, Sam Smith ... the list goes on and on and on. This isn\u2019t a trend \u2014 it has been the status quo for decades.

They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. Lewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States.

The color of military uniforms, signs, vehicles, and world fashion spanning decades needs to be accounted for before even opening digital software like Photoshop. That means digging through sources like diaries, government records, old advertisements, and even consulting historical experts to get the colors right.But even after the arduous research, restoration, and blending of color, the image still isn\u2019t finished. In order to achieve true photorealism, the physics of how light works in the atmosphere needs to be taken into account. Colors look different depending on the lighting conditions when the photo was taken, so artists rely on shadows and the location of light to make an educated guess about the time of day in a black-and-white photo.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.But Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company \u2014 and viewers \u2014 demanded.Though the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. Lewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States. See the entire collection of Lewis Hine's photos for the National Child Labor Committee here: https://www.loc.gov/collections/natio...Darkroom is a series from Vox producer Coleman Lowndes that digs into stories of the past, one photograph at a time.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIf you\u2019ve been to New York, you\u2019ve probably visited Central Park. But there\u2019s a part of its story you won't see. It\u2019s a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.Everything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it \u201cThe Central Park.\u201d In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.Have an idea for a story that Ranjani should investigate for Missing Chapter?

In 1912, he reached the Pole only to learn that his Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen, had beat him to it. Caught by freakish weather and a string of bad luck, his entire party died trying to get back. Reasons for his failure range from his use of ponies rather than dogs to a highly unusual temperature drop that made the journey back impossible to survive.Darkroom is a new series from Vox producer Coleman Lowndes that digs into stories of the past, one photograph at a time.

The devastating policies of his Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) \u2014 which forced millions of peasants to work tirelessly on government farming communes and by manufacturing crude steel \u2014 resulted in the greatest famine known to human history, costing anywhere between 23 and 55 million lives. Mao wanted to leave behind a powerful Communist legacy, like Marx and Lenin before him. And in order to do so, he needed to connect with the younger generation before he died. So after announcing his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he swam across the Yangtze River. Mao had done the same swim 10 years earlier to prove his vitality, and he hoped it would work again.His \"Cultural Revolution\" was a call to hunt down and eliminate his enemies, and reeducate China\u2019s youth with the principles Maoism. Led by the fanatical Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution was a devastating 10-year period in Chinese history that didn\u2019t end until Mao died in 1976.Additional reading: Embodying Maoism: The swimming craze, the Mao cult, and body politics in Communist China, 1950s\u20131970s, by Shuk-wah Poon https://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X1700...Red-Color News Soldier, by Li Zhenshenghttp://red-colornewssoldier.com/Darkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

It\u2019s now in its 109th edition and it\u2019s being called the \u2018Highest in History\u2019 because there are more climbs than ever before. This is important because the climbs are where the race is won and lost. The best riders rely on their teammates to get them through the long, flat, and hilly stages, before they take on the mountain stages on their own.

But the irregular verbs might be the most confusing part. Why is \u201ctold\u201d the past tense of \u201ctell\u201d but \u201csmold\u201d isn\u2019t the past tense of \u201csmell\u201d? It turns out that the study of irregular verbs can teach us a lot about how languages evolve.

For eons, nature has relied on photosynthesis as a big way to keep carbon dioxide levels from getting out of control. But as we have put more carbon into the air, we\u2019ve also cut down many of the forests we need to suck that carbon up. So big tree-planting initiatives like #TeamTrees to the rescue, right? Actually, we need to think bigger. Here\u2019s three ways trees really can help us solve climate change, from a guy who wants to plant a TRILLION trees, to how we might save the forests we\u2019ve got, to scientists hacking biology to make trees even better.

Blue rocks, blue sky, blue water, sure. But blue animals? They are few and far between. And the ones that do make blue? They make it in some very strange and special ways compared to other colors. In this video, we'll look at some very cool butterflies to help us learn how living things make blue, and why this beautiful hue is so rare in nature.SPECIAL THANKS:Smithsonian Institution - National Museum of Natural HistoryBob Robbins, Ph.D. - Curator of LepidopteraJuan Pablo Hurtado Padilla - Microscope EducatorRichard Prum, Ph.D. - Yale UniversityVinothan Manoharan, Ph.D. - Harvard UniversitySOURCES:Bagnara, J.

But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.Here\u2019s where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether healthy people should also wear masks to protect themselves from infection.The truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they\u2019re most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.But experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks matters a lot less when you consider one of Covid-19\u2019s most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease\u2019s long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it\u2019s almost impossible to be completely sure that you don\u2019t already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.More of Vox.com's coverage of face masks: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/31/2119813...An in-depth explainer on viral respiratory particle behavior and covid-19 transmission: https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/cov...The US Center for Disease Control's current guidance on face masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-...An MIT disease transmission researcher's study on respiratory droplets and aerosols: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama...Ed Yong's great explainer on the confusion around face masks: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/ar...For the full Schlieren mirror video from Bauhaus University, Weimar: https://vimeo.com/399120258The World Health Organization's updated recommendations on face mask use: https://www.who.int/publications-deta...Our source for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases: https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-relea...The headline on this piece has been updated.

Unfortunately, it seems like over the last few weeks we\u2019ve become victims to \u201cCaution Fatigue\u201d and reverted back to the behavior that caused our new cases to spike in the first place. There are so many factors behind the latest spike, where 18 states are seeing a dramatic increase in new cases, with many actually soaring well above their all-time highs. Protests of all kinds are definitely a contributing factor, so please make sure you\u2019re wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, and remaining outdoors if you\u2019re marching with a group of people. We will get through this!If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously.

            "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Anna Verhulst (23) is a fifth year medical student at Maastricht University, doing her internship in Eindhoven. She has a particular interest in the fields of oncology and sports medicine, but isn\u2019t quite sure yet what kind of doctor she wants to become when she graduates in 2016. Anna is a keen writer, sharing her experiences as a junior intern through columns, essays and opinion pieces. A selection of her publications can be found at annaverhulst.blogspot.nl. In between her internships, she is also involved in a research project that explores the possibilities of exercise rehabilitation in cancer survivors.On stage at TEDx Maastricht 2014, Anna will share a story that she has purposely kept silent for a long time. It is a story that has nothing to do with her work as a medical student, researcher or writer. It is her personal story, for which she has finally worked up the courage to share it with the public.Website: http://tedxmaastricht.nlFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxmaa...Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/TEDxMaastrichtTwitter: https://twitter.com/TEDxMaastrichtAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

This video features the healthcare creators of the Olson Mask.NOTE: These are NOT meant to replace manufactured masks.Updated pattern and more information can be found at: https://bit.ly/UPHMaskJust want the PDF of the pattern go here: https://bit.ly/UPHOlsonMask**The hospital will provide the filter, double-sided tape and hair bands and assemble here after masks are dropped off.**UnityPoint Health \u2013 Cedar Rapids, Iowa has an adequate supply of masks however \u2013 they remain in short supply nationwide due to COVID-19. The hospital is looking to be proactive in addressing the possibility of future supply challenges. Therefore, St. Luke's is calling all sewers to help make masks. Our hope is that we won't need them, but we must plan for the unknown. Fabric masks offer the benefit of being able to be washed and re-used as each healthcare worker will need to change their mask several times during their shifts, as the mask becomes soiled or damp \u2013 for maximum protection.A new modular mask, The Olson, named after 1930's legendary maker nurse Lyla Mae Olson, was quickly developed by clinicians from UnityPoint Health and is being shared across the globe in the fight against COVID19. A group of clinicians teamed up in the hospital's generate prototyping space to create a series of experimental designs rooted material science and easy fabrication. No special instruments are required for fabrication, and the pattern is compatible with common mask patterns being released around the country.Your time and talent can greatly impact our ability to care for our community members and help ensure our safety as we do. Fabric masks offer the benefit of being able to be washed and re-used. They don't have to be stylish - just functional. Non-matching fabrics, thread, elastics are fine. It just needs to be well sewn mask - with no frayed edges or missed seams.Download the Olson Mask pattern here: https://bit.ly/UPHMaskCompleted MasksEnclose completed masks in a closed plastic bag or closed plastic box.We will launder them prior to use so no need to wash before delivering.Please deliver to the St. Luke's Foundation, 855 A Ave. NE,  1st floor, Cedar Rapids.

            "description": "Surgeon's Tips: Stop Fogging & Improve Seal on Surgical/Medical Face MasksHow to video for Medical Students, Nursing Students, and people in general who want to wear medical face masks more like the Healthcare Professionals to minimize fogging, and improve the seal around the mask.  Why is this important? The surgeon, assisting residents, medical students, nurses, scrub techs cannot touch their face mask face or head covering once they \u201cscrubbed in\u201d for surgery.  When operating or assisting in an operation, you will be \u201cscrubbed in\u201d AKA wearing **sterile** PPE (personal protective equipment: surgical gown, gloves. Your head covering, eye protection and face mask is not considered sterile, so you cannot reach up to your face or head. This will break the \u201csterile field\u201d and you will need to remove the glove that touched your mask.  This is considered bad form and the surgeon or scrub nurse will think you are not experienced.  Ideally you can maximize the fit and comfort of the surgical face mask before entering surgery, to avoid fogging of your eye protection later on during the surgery.  Vision is critical. If the surgeon says to retest here or clamp there, but you can\u2019t see through the fog or condensation you may make a mistake.  How does this translate to regular people wearing masks during the pandemic?  Once you leave your \u201csafe place\u201d (your home or car) and enter a store or public building or room, you should not be touching your head, face or mask, similar to surgery.  So making sure that you are wearing face mask like you are about to help with an operation should minimize any need to touch the mask, until you have returned home or back into your car.  Weaknesses of this video.1. I didn\u2019t discuss how to carefully remove a medical face mask (already many videos explaining it.)2. Medical face masks and CLOTH DIY face masks are DIFFERENT and this may not work for Cloth face masks because the cloth is not fluid resistant and the humidity go through the cloth and still fog the glasses. 3. When wearing a surgical face mask in the operating room, the temperature does not change.  Condensation of water on cold metal/glass/plastic**Some fogging can occur when your glasses get cold from being outside, then when you enter a warmer room the cold glasses will fog up from any humidity in the air and any humidity from the mask. This is similar to why a cold drink gets wet on the outside of the can or glass.  Simple Hack***This video does not address how to keep your glasses warm.  A simple trick is to have a second pair of glasses kept at body temperature inside your coat or jacket. When you go indoors you can remove the cold glasses and wear the warm one. Put the cold glasses against your body to warm it up and it won\u2019t fog up once it is warm.",

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)\u00a0and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\u00a0caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. \u00a0Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.\u00a0It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020). Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the origin and zoonosis of COVID-19, the routes of transmission, epidemiology (current as of 3/15/2020), pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to identify COVID-19. As new information and research is published we will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 and ensure all of our viewers are kept up to date on the most recent data.

            "description": "Ninja Nerds,Join us for our lecture on COVID-19 where Ninja Nerd Science will go into detail on the virology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology/pathology of COVID-19. This is our April update on our previous lecture to keep all of our viewers informed on the new research and publications that have been released on COVID-19. Please be aware\u2014 This lecture is up to date as of April 17, 2020. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. \u00a0In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don\u2019t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.World Health Organization (WHO) | 8 April 2020REFERENCES | We have a complete list of our references in AMA format on our Facebook & Instagram!Support us by purchasing apparel and donating to our PayPal or Patreon! \ud83d\ude04--Become a Patron of ours and receive the final, high resolution photo of the lecture!FUNDINGGoFundMe | https://www.gofundme.com/ninja-nerd-s...APPAREL |Amazon Prime Free Delivery | https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Nerd-Sci...Teespring | teespring.com/stores/ninja-nerd PATREON | https://www.patreon.com/NinjaNerdScienceSOCIAL MEDIAFACEBOOK | https://www.facebook.com/NinjaNerdSci...INSTAGRAM | https://www.instagram.com/ninjanerdsc...ALSO, check out our Medical channel | Ninja Nerd Medicine!https://www.youtube.com/ninjanerdmedi...",

For the ones who did not die of large pulmonary emboli, they died of the extensive inflammation within the lungs, meaning pneumonia with ARDS. In these cases, the lungs were wet and heavy, much like a sponge that is saturated with water. The surfaces of the lung often had a distinct patchy pattern, with pale areas alternating with slightly protruding and firm, deep reddish-blue hypercapillarized areas. This is indicative of areas of intense inflammation, with endothelial dysfunction that can be seen at the microscopic level. When they look at slices of the lungs under the microscope, they found diffuse alveolar damage in 8 cases. Specifically, they saw hyaline membrane formation, and tiny clots in the capillaries, and capillaries that were engorged with red blood cells, and other inflammatory findings. All these findings represent ARDS. They also found lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, infiltrated these areas of infiltration.  This fits the picture of viral pathogenesis.They also looked at the pharynx of these patients, meaning in their throat. The lining of the throat, or mucosa, was hyperemic, meaning very red and irritated, and at the microscopic level, they saw lymphocytes invading there, which is consistent with a viral infection. In one case, a patient had lymphocytes invade his heart muscle, findings that are consistent with what we call viral myocarditis. More than half of the patients in this study had large blood clots. One-third of the patients had pulmonary embolism as the direct cause of death. All the others died of intense inflammation in their lungs related to pneumonia with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Recently there\u2019s been studies showing that about 1/3rd of patients with severe COVID have blood clots. Another study of 191 patients with coronavirus aka COVID-19, half of those who died had clots, compared with 7% of survivors. And levels of D-dimer that were greater than 1000 \u00b5g/L were associated with a fatal outcome. So it's pretty clear now that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing a lot of clots to form in moderate to severe COVID disease.How is this happening? It's likely a combination of reasons, that has to do with downregulation of the ACE2 receptor in the lung alveoli, with a subsequent shift towards having more angiotensin II in the lungs, and less angiotensin 1-7 and 1-9 in the lungs, and when this happens, this leads to more cytokine storm with more inflammation, more constriction of pulmonary arteries, and more clots that develop. That, in turn, leads to more endothelial dysfunction in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. Also, there is evidence that the virus attaches to the ACE2 receptors of those endothelial cells that line those capillaries, which further propagates inflammation and clotting. And in the cytokine storm that develops there, RANTES, a chemokine, binds to the CCR5 receptor of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, and that causes those lymphocytes to infiltrate those areas of inflammation, and in doing so, further contributes towards the inflammatory reaction. This is why we are seeing low levels of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in severe COVID. Endothelial damage can also lead to the development of antiphospholipid antibodies, and these antibodies are bad because they trigger the formation of blood clots. That\u2019s why patients who have clots with the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome need to be on blood thinners. Also, 11 out of the 12 patients in this study had underlying heart disease and were obese. These are known risk factors not just for cardiovascular disease, but also known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction, and are known risk factors for COVID.  So the big takeaways from the findings in this study are that most people who die of COVID, it's primarily a lung problem. Either related to inflammation with ARDS and/or blood clots.Antiphospholipid syndrome might be a commonality among patients with thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.Dr. Mike Hansen, MDInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care MedicineWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/Instagram Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/#coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19",

But as the weather gets warmer, public places start to open up, and many places enter their fourth month of life under coronavirus, that\u2019s becoming less and less realistic.At the same time, we know that coronavirus can be transmitted through the air -- and that raises some pretty big questions. Is it safe to go the beach? What about a park? Is a heavy-breathing runner going to infect you as they pass you?

Unfortunately, it seems like over the last few weeks we\u2019ve become victims to \u201cCaution Fatigue\u201d and reverted back to the behavior that caused our new cases to spike in the first place. There are so many factors behind the latest spike, where 18 states are seeing a dramatic increase in new cases, with many actually soaring well above their all-time highs. Protests of all kinds are definitely a contributing factor, so please make sure you\u2019re wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, and remaining outdoors if you\u2019re marching with a group of people. We will get through this!If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch.
