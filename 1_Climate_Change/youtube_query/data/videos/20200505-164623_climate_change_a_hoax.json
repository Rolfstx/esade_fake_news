Through his work on this ancient language, Irving Finkel, has uncovered amazing secrets from over five thousand years ago, including the story behind Noah\u2019s ark.Irving Finkel is the curator in charge of cuneiform inscriptions on tablets of clay from ancient Mesopotamia at the British Museum, of which the Middle East Department has the largest collection of any modern museum. This work involves reading and translating all sorts of inscriptions, sometimes working on ancient archives to identify manuscripts that belong together, or even join to one another.

Preserved on clay tablets in cuneiform script, it is generally considered to be the earliest great work of literature to survive from the ancient world. In this illustrated lecture, Andrew George, author of a prize-winning translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh, explores four themes related to this Babylonian masterpiece: the archaeology of the poem\u2019s recovery, the reconstruction of its text, the story it tells, and its messages about life and death.Presented in collaboration with the Departments of Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations and Comparative Literature, with the support of the Provostial Fund for the Arts and Humanities, Harvard University",

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff wrote a monumental book about the new economic order that is alarming. \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" reveals how the biggest tech companies deal with our data. How do we regain control of our data? What is surveillance capitalism?In this documentary, Zuboff takes the lid off Google and Facebook and reveals a merciless form of capitalism in which no natural resources, but the citizen itself, serves as a raw material. How can citizens regain control of their data?It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the \"residual data\" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user. Internet advertisements can, therefore, be used in a very targeted and effective way. A completely new business model is born: \"surveillance capitalism.\"Original title: De grote dataroofDirector: Roland DuongResearch: Tom Reijner, Halil Ibrahim \u00d6zpamukCamera: Adri SchroverSound: Jochem SaleminkEditing: Roland Duong, Paul Delput, Rinze SchuurmanProduction: Marie SchutgensProduction assistant: Britt BenninkImage Editing: Rob Dorrestijn, Paula WitkampOnline Coordinator: Arja van den BerghCommissioning Editors: Bregtje van der Haak, Doke RomeijnOn VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.This channel offers some of the best travel series from the Dutch broadcaster VPRO.

I\u2019m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I\u2019m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, \u201cWhat has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?\u201d  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.  I still remember my elementary school teacher coming into the...To read the full transcript and for more info, please visit https://bigthink.com/videos/universe-...",

With economic returns often uncertain, space programmes have tended to be led by governments, because only they can invest in programmes that have a long-term pay-off, whether economic or geopolitical. When it comes to saving humanity from an asteroid impact, Tyson stressed that rather than establishing colonies in space, we would be better to try to deflect the asteroid.\u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0646\u064a\u0644 \u062f\u064a\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646\u060c \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0643\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0639\u062b\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u064f\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629\u064b \u0625\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u062f\u0641\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u063a\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627. \u0648\u0641\u064a \u063a\u064a\u0627\u0628 \u0636\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0635\u060c \u062a\u062a\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u062f\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0644\u060c \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0628\u064f\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0623\u0648 \u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a. \u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0629 \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0633\u0637\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0643\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u062d\u0633\u0628\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u064a \u062f\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0642\u062f \u064a\u062d\u0644\u0651 \u0628\u0643\u0648\u0643\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0646\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0629 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636\u0647 \u0644\u0627\u0635\u0637\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u064a\u0632\u0643\u060c \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0632\u0643 \u064a\u0638\u0644 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629",

            "description": "As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to \"Influencers.\" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.ANDY SERWER: Right.CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word \"common sense,\" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things.

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

            "description": "Recorded on February 11, 2019. How much will it cost to slow climate change? Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, performs cost-benefit analysis on the Green New Deal and the UN\u2019s Climate Report, analyzes the economic impact of climate change in the next century, and proposes economically feasible alternative plans to reduce climate change. Is climate change the rapidly impending apocalypse it seems? Bjorn Lomborg discusses climate change as depicted in doomsday films like The Day after Tomorrow and breaks down why it will not be an instantaneous apocalypse as often portrayed. He talks about the economic impact climate change will have on the global GDP in the next one hundred years if not solved and the impact on the global GDP if money is spent towards resolving it. He details the reasons Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal is not feasible in the ten-year timeline she has proposed and why, even if it were feasible, it would be prohibitively expensive. He discusses the reality of reducing the amount of energy used in developing countries and how it\u2019s unlikely that those countries will be willing to give up on things like electricity now that they have it. Lomborg suggests that the best way to resolve climate change is to put money now towards research and development for new, cleaner sources of energy that are cheaper than coal and natural gas, because countries will be much more likely to adopt a new energy resource if it is the cheapest option. Finding cheaper energy solutions will have a positive impact on global GDP, and people will be much more willing to adopt it. He also suggests implementing a modest carbon tax, which would have a great long-term impact on reducing climate change.

But what about when those technologies destroy the environment? In this provocative talk, Time Magazine \u201cHero of the Environment\u201d and energy expert, Michael Shellenberger explains why solar and wind farms require so much land for mining and energy production, and an alternative path to saving both the climate and the natural environment. Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road. He lives in Berkeley, California. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Join us for DIG & DELVE!What is DIG & DELVE?DIG & DELVE is an annual conference in Ottawa that is all about giving people a safe space to engage in discussion and explore deep issues that humans have been wrestling with for a long time.One popular worldview promoted in our media is that it is foolish to believe in God.   Influential writers disparage those interested in considering the relevance of faith to life.Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.   \u2013 Richard DawkinsAt DIG & DELVE we hope to provide an open, honest and respectful environment where people can explore reasons why faith makes sense and why it is meaningful to give consideration to the life and teaching of Jesus.   We hope to encourage curiosity and a healthy critical inquisitiveness.   People coming from a spectrum of world-views, Christian and otherwise, are welcome.At DIG & DELVE, we gather talented experts in their fields to come and share their opinions about deep issues human wrestle with and together we discuss some of the latest research around these questions.Expect to be challenged.  Join us at DIG & DELVE.For more information go to diganddelve.caThanks for watching",

Murray examines the most divisive issues today, including sexuality, gender, and technology, and how new culture wars are playing out everywhere in the name of social justice, identity politics, and intersectionality. Is European culture and society in a death spiral caused by immigration and assimilation? Robinson and Murray also discuss the roles that Brexit and the rise of populism in European politics play in writing immigration laws across the European Union.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

            "description": "As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to \"Influencers.\" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.ANDY SERWER: Right.CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word \"common sense,\" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.For more of this transcript click;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/influe...Subscribe to Yahoo Finance: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbAbout Yahoo Finance: At Yahoo Finance, you get free stock quotes, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, international market data, social interaction and mortgage rates that help you manage your financial life.Connect with Yahoo Finance:Get the latest news: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbFind Yahoo Finance on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2A9u5ZqFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2LMgloPFollow Yahoo Finance on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LOpNYz",

            "description": "Get the latest up-to-the-minute continuous stock market coverage and big interviews in the world of finance every Monday\u2013Friday from 9 am to 5pm (ET).#YahooFinance #Stocks #coronaviruscovid19The lineup:9am - 11am: The First Trade11am - 1pm: On The Move1pm - 3pm: The Ticker3pm - 5pm: The Final Round#Stockmarket #coronavirus #YahooFinanceStock futures were higher Tuesday morning after a choppy session a day earlier, as investors weighed a plethora of developments impacting the health, economic, corporate profitability and geopolitical implications of the coronavirus pandemic.June crude oil futures (CL=F) extended gains and jumped more than 9% to above $22 per barrel, pacing toward a fifth straight session of gains.Across the U.S., cases as a whole rose to more than 1.1 million, with deaths topping 67,000. States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

John Ratcliffe, appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing. Ratcliffe was nominated for the same post last year but withdrew after even GOP lawmakers said he was too partisan and inexperienced. 'Never has anyone more unqualified been formally nominated by a President to lead the U.S. Intelligence Community,' said Larry Pfeiffer, former CIA chief of staff. Ratcliffe has repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated claims about a 'deep state' and his Twitter account follows a number of fringe activists who promote the 'the outlandish QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that the world is run by a cabal of Democratic pedophile-cannibals,' the Daily Beast reports.\u00bb Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe\u00bb Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis#Intelligence #Senate #JohnRatcliffe #News #NowThis #NowThisNewsConnect with NowThis\u00bb Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook\u00bb Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter\u00bb Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram\u00bb Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once.

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Science writer, biologist, neuroscientist, and stress expert Dr. Robert Sapolsky presents the inaugural Fenton-Rhodes Lecture on Proactve Wellness.  Sapolsky states that our bodies' stress response evolved to help us get out of short-term physical emergencies - if a lion is chasing you, you run. But such reactions, he points out, compromise long-term physical health in favor of immediate self-preservation. Unfortunately, when confronted with purely psychological stressors, such as troubleshooting the fax machine, modern humans turn on the same stress response. \"If you turn it on for too long,\" notes Sapolsky, \"you get sick.\" Sapolsky regards this sobering news with characteristic good humor, finding hope in \"our own capacity to prevent some of these problems... in the small steps with which we live our everyday lives.\"This lecture was recorded on September 22, 2016 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts' Colwell Playhouse as part of the Pygmalion TechFest",

He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Duke University in 1995, and has since served on the faculties of the University of Colorado and (presently) the University of Kansas. The author of over 40 professional articles on mental illness, Dr. Ilardi is a nationally recognized expert on depression. His work has been honored by the American Psychological Association's prestigious Blau Award for early career contributions to the field, and his research on the neuroscience of depression has been funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH).Dr. Ilardi has also received several major teaching awards in recognition of his dynamic, engaging classroom presence. Recently, he was selected from a pool of over 2,000 instructors as the recipient of the school's highest instructional honor, the HOPE Award for teaching excellence. He also maintains an active clinical practice, and has treated several hundred depressed patients over the course of his career. Dr. Ilardi lives in Lawrence, Kansas with his wife, Maria and daughter, Abby.-In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Having presented at over 500 colleges and Universities nationwide, hundreds of leadership symposiums, and countless local and regional organizations, Adam Carroll\u2019s message of Building A Bigger Life, Not a Bigger Lifestyle has been heard by over 200,000+ people.In early 2014, Adam successfully crowd-funded a documentary on student loan debt, raising nearly $70,000 in 45 days. The film, Broke Busted & Disgusted is due out in early 2015 and is already garnering critical acclaim. The mission of the film is to start a national debate about changing the way we fund college and not crippling 20 somethings with mountains of debt.Adam\u2019s core message is we are all after the same thing \u2013 to relentlessly pursue our passions, live simply and happily, and make a difference to those around us.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Afterwards, he graduated from UNC at Chapel Hill earning degrees in both Speech and Physical Education, later earning certification as a Health Promotion Director from the Cooper Institute\u00ae in Dallas, Texas. He served with the Portland Police Bureau and later joined a national network of medical and fitness leaders dedicated to teaching the health benefits of daily exercise. He has been an author, counselor, seminary graduate and pastor to Portland-area retirement homes. He has trained the Portland Trailblazers and Seattle Seahawks, and he has been asked to write a book on his work providing fitness training for paraplegics.Ogie has had a passion for fitness, health, business, and music all of his life. His career goal is to establish a model for a fitness lifestyle for Americans that is sufficient to impact physical and mental health. He has given over 5000 speeches on fitness motivation.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

            "description": "In this talk Mark shares a dramatic and powerful system that takes productivity thinking to whole new and terrifying level, allowing a person to achieve almost any goal they set themselves with rapid speed. The secret to this type of exponential success? Bin your \u2018affirmations\u2019 and \u2018goals\u2019 and instead embrace fear as your friend by making irreversible decisions. Instead of hapless resolutions members of the \"Lock-In\" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The \u201cLock-In\" system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives. Many of the most successful people in history have used its phenomenal power to create extraordinary success. Think you're hardcore enough? Then enter the Cult of Extreme Productivity Mark Adams is Vice President and Head of Innovation at VICE, which has come from humble beginnings as a print magazine to digitally transform into a 5 billion dollar youth media empire. In this talk, Mark describes the cult of extreme productivity that he became part of alongside his brother. The cult is all about making irreversible decisions that make \u201cmanifesting\u201d your dreams the only option because not achieving it would create indescribable suffering. This is the second time Mark has done a TEDx talk. The first time his talk was banned. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

Watts believes much of the data used to support global warming theories is faulty.  The big problem, as Watts sees it, is that the stations were temperatures are gathered are too close to urban developments where heat is soaked up and distorts the readings. So it looks like the earth is warming though it may not be.For more on this story, visit The PBS NewsHour: http://www.pbs.org/newshour",

Preserved on clay tablets in cuneiform script, it is generally considered to be the earliest great work of literature to survive from the ancient world. In this illustrated lecture, Andrew George, author of a prize-winning translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh, explores four themes related to this Babylonian masterpiece: the archaeology of the poem\u2019s recovery, the reconstruction of its text, the story it tells, and its messages about life and death.Presented in collaboration with the Departments of Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations and Comparative Literature, with the support of the Provostial Fund for the Arts and Humanities, Harvard University",

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff wrote a monumental book about the new economic order that is alarming. \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" reveals how the biggest tech companies deal with our data. How do we regain control of our data? What is surveillance capitalism?In this documentary, Zuboff takes the lid off Google and Facebook and reveals a merciless form of capitalism in which no natural resources, but the citizen itself, serves as a raw material. How can citizens regain control of their data?It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the \"residual data\" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user. Internet advertisements can, therefore, be used in a very targeted and effective way. A completely new business model is born: \"surveillance capitalism.\"Original title: De grote dataroofDirector: Roland DuongResearch: Tom Reijner, Halil Ibrahim \u00d6zpamukCamera: Adri SchroverSound: Jochem SaleminkEditing: Roland Duong, Paul Delput, Rinze SchuurmanProduction: Marie SchutgensProduction assistant: Britt BenninkImage Editing: Rob Dorrestijn, Paula WitkampOnline Coordinator: Arja van den BerghCommissioning Editors: Bregtje van der Haak, Doke RomeijnOn VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.This channel offers some of the best travel series from the Dutch broadcaster VPRO.

I\u2019m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I\u2019m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, \u201cWhat has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?\u201d  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.  I still remember my elementary school teacher coming into the...To read the full transcript and for more info, please visit https://bigthink.com/videos/universe-...",

            "description": "As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to \"Influencers.\" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.ANDY SERWER: Right.CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word \"common sense,\" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.For more of this transcript click;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/influe...Subscribe to Yahoo Finance: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbAbout Yahoo Finance: At Yahoo Finance, you get free stock quotes, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, international market data, social interaction and mortgage rates that help you manage your financial life.Connect with Yahoo Finance:Get the latest news: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbFind Yahoo Finance on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2A9u5ZqFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2LMgloPFollow Yahoo Finance on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LOpNYz",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders.

            "description": "Recorded on February 11, 2019. How much will it cost to slow climate change? Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, performs cost-benefit analysis on the Green New Deal and the UN\u2019s Climate Report, analyzes the economic impact of climate change in the next century, and proposes economically feasible alternative plans to reduce climate change. Is climate change the rapidly impending apocalypse it seems? Bjorn Lomborg discusses climate change as depicted in doomsday films like The Day after Tomorrow and breaks down why it will not be an instantaneous apocalypse as often portrayed. He talks about the economic impact climate change will have on the global GDP in the next one hundred years if not solved and the impact on the global GDP if money is spent towards resolving it. He details the reasons Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal is not feasible in the ten-year timeline she has proposed and why, even if it were feasible, it would be prohibitively expensive. He discusses the reality of reducing the amount of energy used in developing countries and how it\u2019s unlikely that those countries will be willing to give up on things like electricity now that they have it. Lomborg suggests that the best way to resolve climate change is to put money now towards research and development for new, cleaner sources of energy that are cheaper than coal and natural gas, because countries will be much more likely to adopt a new energy resource if it is the cheapest option. Finding cheaper energy solutions will have a positive impact on global GDP, and people will be much more willing to adopt it. He also suggests implementing a modest carbon tax, which would have a great long-term impact on reducing climate change.

But what about when those technologies destroy the environment? In this provocative talk, Time Magazine \u201cHero of the Environment\u201d and energy expert, Michael Shellenberger explains why solar and wind farms require so much land for mining and energy production, and an alternative path to saving both the climate and the natural environment. Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road. He lives in Berkeley, California. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Join us for DIG & DELVE!What is DIG & DELVE?DIG & DELVE is an annual conference in Ottawa that is all about giving people a safe space to engage in discussion and explore deep issues that humans have been wrestling with for a long time.One popular worldview promoted in our media is that it is foolish to believe in God.   Influential writers disparage those interested in considering the relevance of faith to life.Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.   \u2013 Richard DawkinsAt DIG & DELVE we hope to provide an open, honest and respectful environment where people can explore reasons why faith makes sense and why it is meaningful to give consideration to the life and teaching of Jesus.   We hope to encourage curiosity and a healthy critical inquisitiveness.   People coming from a spectrum of world-views, Christian and otherwise, are welcome.At DIG & DELVE, we gather talented experts in their fields to come and share their opinions about deep issues human wrestle with and together we discuss some of the latest research around these questions.Expect to be challenged.  Join us at DIG & DELVE.For more information go to diganddelve.caThanks for watching",

Drawing on his experiences as a Nixon intimate, in conjunction with a detailed analysis of the period\u2019s social and political events, Buchanan closely examines how a man so bitterly and decisively beaten as Nixon was in both a presidential and a gubernatorial election could go on to become the nation\u2019s 37th president.

Murray examines the most divisive issues today, including sexuality, gender, and technology, and how new culture wars are playing out everywhere in the name of social justice, identity politics, and intersectionality. Is European culture and society in a death spiral caused by immigration and assimilation? Robinson and Murray also discuss the roles that Brexit and the rise of populism in European politics play in writing immigration laws across the European Union.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

Trump finished by addressing a few questions from students, which had been texted during the speech. Trump also spent time praising Liberty for its notoriety and honoring its founder, Dr. Jerry Falwell, Sr., whom he had met on several occasions and Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.Prior to his speech, Trump was awarded an honorary doctorate of business in recognition of his \"unwavering and public commitment to our nation's founding principles of limited government, individual liberty, and the free enterprise system, and in further recognition of his iconic status as one of America's most successful visionaries and entrepreneurs.\"http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=...",

He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

Murray examines the most divisive issues today, including sexuality, gender, and technology, and how new culture wars are playing out everywhere in the name of social justice, identity politics, and intersectionality. Is European culture and society in a death spiral caused by immigration and assimilation?

He says intellectuals make alarming predictions using causes like global warming to create a need for their services.-----Thomas Sowell introduces his new book Intellectuals and Society and expounds on what he calls \"the fatal misstep of intellectuals\" -- the assumption that superior ability within a particular realm can be generalized as superior wisdom or morality over all. He offers examples of this misstep in areas as divergent as economics, the environment, and national defense.Finally, he warns us to resist the influence of intellectuals and points out that the demand for public intellectuals is largely manufactured by the public intellectuals themselves. - Hoover InstitutionThomas Sowell is an American economist, political writer, and commentator. He is currently a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. In 1990, he won the Francis Boyer Award, presented by the American Enterprise Institute. In 2002 he was awarded the National Humanities Medal for prolific scholarship melding history, economics, and political science.Peter M.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on July 12, 2017The Dilbert comic strip artist and political philosopher Scott Adams sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. He discusses with Peter  his theory of \u201ctalent stacking,\u201d the idea that rather than being an expert in one particular skill (i.e.,  Tiger Woods and golf), one can become successful by stacking a variety of complementary nonexpert skills. Adams demonstrates how talent stacking has been beneficial in his life because he has stacked  comic artist skills with his MBA and experience in corporate environments to create a wildly successful comic strip that resulted in spin-off books, a television series, a video game, and merchandise. His business skills gave him the tools to create a business satire comic strip and the skill set to manage the business that evolved from that  strip.  Adams also discusses how he uses his Dilbert blog to discuss his political philosophies and observations about the Trump administration. He wrote blogposts about the 2016 election and predicted that Donald Trump would win based on President Trump\u2019s talent stack as a media mogul and businessman who had spent significant time in the public eye so  was immune to scandals and thick-skinned enough to handle what the media and other politicians would throw at him. Adams argues that President Trump is one of the best branders, influencers, and persuaders  he has ever seen, in that the president uses persuasive techniques in debates and on social media as a way to get people to do what he wants. Adams contends that President Trump\u2019s persuasive techniques will help solve the problem of North Korea because he has already set up China to get involved by intimating that it tried and  failed. Adams believes this will cause China to get involved  to save face. Scott Adams and Peter Robinson finish by chatting about Adams\u2019s views on the story arc of life. Adams says that  he believes he started intentionally selfish so that by the end of his life he can give away all of his wealth, knowledge, and wisdom, a process he says he has already begun. They also briefly discuss his new book, Win Bigly, about the persuasive strategies of Donald Trump. Scott Adams is releasing his new book, Win Bigly, in October 2017.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/how-fa...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.----------------In 2015, Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the massively popular comic strip Dilbert, boldly predicted that Donald Trump would win the 2016 presidential election.\"The reason I can see it coming is because I have studied this field of persuasion,\" says Adams. \"I saw this Trump character and he had the full tool set.\" The 60-year-old Bay Area resident doesn't agree with Trump on many political issues, but his prediction was enough for his to receive death threats from embittered Hillary Clinton supporters.Adam's new book, Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter, is both a detailed analysis of how Trump reframed political rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and a guide to how all of us can communicate more effectively and persuasively.Adams sat down with Reason's Nick Gillespie in front of a live audience in San Francisco to talk about his book, his \"extreme liberal\" views, the popularity of his live broadcasts with followers via Twitter, and why Trump is a \"master persuader.\"Cameras by Zach Weismueller, Paul Detrick, and Justin Monticello.

            "description": "Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or\u00a0replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin\u2019s theory in their two books and essay, respectively\u00a0The Deniable Darwin,\u00a0Darwin\u2019s Doubt, and \u201cGiving Up Darwin\u201d (published in the\u00a0Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term \u201cspecies\u201d has not been defined by the authors to Darwin\u2019s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin\u2019s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): \u201cBeauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe\u2014walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track\u2014most of the time.\u201d Gelernter notes that there\u2019s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture\u2014not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin\u2019s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on July 12, 2017The Dilbert comic strip artist and political philosopher Scott Adams sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. He discusses with Peter  his theory of \u201ctalent stacking,\u201d the idea that rather than being an expert in one particular skill (i.e.,  Tiger Woods and golf), one can become successful by stacking a variety of complementary nonexpert skills. Adams demonstrates how talent stacking has been beneficial in his life because he has stacked  comic artist skills with his MBA and experience in corporate environments to create a wildly successful comic strip that resulted in spin-off books, a television series, a video game, and merchandise. His business skills gave him the tools to create a business satire comic strip and the skill set to manage the business that evolved from that  strip.  Adams also discusses how he uses his Dilbert blog to discuss his political philosophies and observations about the Trump administration. He wrote blogposts about the 2016 election and predicted that Donald Trump would win based on President Trump\u2019s talent stack as a media mogul and businessman who had spent significant time in the public eye so  was immune to scandals and thick-skinned enough to handle what the media and other politicians would throw at him. Adams argues that President Trump is one of the best branders, influencers, and persuaders  he has ever seen, in that the president uses persuasive techniques in debates and on social media as a way to get people to do what he wants. Adams contends that President Trump\u2019s persuasive techniques will help solve the problem of North Korea because he has already set up China to get involved by intimating that it tried and  failed. Adams believes this will cause China to get involved  to save face. Scott Adams and Peter Robinson finish by chatting about Adams\u2019s views on the story arc of life. Adams says that  he believes he started intentionally selfish so that by the end of his life he can give away all of his wealth, knowledge, and wisdom, a process he says he has already begun. They also briefly discuss his new book, Win Bigly, about the persuasive strategies of Donald Trump. Scott Adams is releasing his new book, Win Bigly, in October 2017.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/how-fa...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Kotkin describes what motivated Stalin to make the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Hitler and the consequences of his decision. Kotkin dives into the history of the USSR and its relationship with Germany during WWII, analyzing the two leaders' decisions, strategies, and thought processes. He explains Stalin's and Hitler\u2019s motivations to enter into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact even without the support of their respective regimes. Stalin\u2019s goal was to defeat the West and he saw the pact as an opportunity to do so by driving a wedge between Germany and the capitalist West. Kotkin analyzes Stalin\u2019s decisions leading up to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and the disinformation Germany was feeding soviet spies to prevent Stalin from moving against Hitler first.

Although various people were vying for the position, Stalin had already  effectively taken over Lenin\u2019s job. Lenin\u2019s last will and testament says bad things about all his successors, with Trotsky coming out the best, yet does nothing to dislodge Stalin from power. Stalin continues, through hard work and cunning, to gather power but also because people believed that he stood for the principles of the revolution.",

            "description": "Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or\u00a0replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin\u2019s theory in their two books and essay, respectively\u00a0The Deniable Darwin,\u00a0Darwin\u2019s Doubt, and \u201cGiving Up Darwin\u201d (published in the\u00a0Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term \u201cspecies\u201d has not been defined by the authors to Darwin\u2019s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin\u2019s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): \u201cBeauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe\u2014walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track\u2014most of the time.\u201d Gelernter notes that there\u2019s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture\u2014not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin\u2019s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on June 2, 2017Senator Benjamin Sasse joins Peter Robinson to discuss his book The Vanishing American Adult and the growing crisis in America of prolonged adolescence. Senator Sasse argues that children are growing up, entering adolescence, and becoming stuck in the transitional stage to adulthood as they fail to become financially independent from their parents. He argues that because this generation of children is growing up during a time of relative peace and prosperity, it has allowed millennials to grow up without the issues of previous generations that were raised in war time. In this era of consumption and material surplus, he argues that adolescents are leading age-segregated lives and not developing a work ethic and that both their parents have an obligation to teach their children to grow up. Furthermore, he stresses the importance of intergenerational learning by allowing children to be raised around their grandparents and other adults to help them learn that the trivial trials of youth don\u2019t matter in the long run. Senator Sasse believes that there are certain virtues that American children have to learn  to become productive and happy adults. Part of that is by teaching children the distinction between production and consumption and how to find happiness and self-worth through jobs that make one feel like a necessary part of the company/society. This, he argues, will help raise peoples\u2019 self-worth and lead them to happiness and fulfillment in their everyday. Senator Sasse finishes by stressing the importance of building children\u2019s identities as readers to help foster the growth of ideas and active learning over the passive activities of sitting in front of screens. He notes that sedentary life is not fulfilling and that by encouraging people to participate in production over consumption will lead to more fulfilling lives. He ends on the optimistic note, that while our youth may still need guidance, overall America\u2019s best days still lie ahead.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/vanish...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded on February 27, 2017In the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he\u2019s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain. Sir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn\u2019t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics. Robinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the \u201cindigenous working classes\u201d who made their voices known through their votes. About the Guest: Sir Roger ScrutonSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his \u201cservices to philosophy, teaching and public education.\u201dAdditional Resources: Brexit:http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-fel...http://www.hoover.org/research/brusse...http://www.hoover.org/research/gibral...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...http://www.hoover.org/research/will-b...

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

The real problem for the poor is the destruction of the family, which Sowell argues dramatically increased once welfare policies were introduced in the 1960s.",

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

Breitbart's new book is Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me while I Save the World!Beginning with his college years at Tulane University, Breitbart unfolds his gradual awakening to conservativism, which culminates in an embrace of Rush Limbaugh. Taking on the challenge to combat the \"Democrat Media Complex\" he explains what he is fighting for.  \"I want a center-right nation to fight for its soul, and its soul is represented in the arts; its soul is represented in a world in which media is everything.\"  He further explains his strategy.   \"My business model is to aim every one of our expos\u00e9s straight at the mainstream media and say, 'Katie Couric, you are being dared not to cover this.'\"",

Three decades of second thoughts then made him this movement's principal intellectual antagonist. \"For better or worse,\" as Horowitz writes in the preface to this, the first volume of his collected conservative writings, \"I have been condemned to spend the rest of my days attempting to understand how the left pursues the agendas from which I have separated myself, and why.\"",

Minimum-wage laws may lift earnings for people who are already employed, but they price a disproportionate number of blacks out of the labor force. Affirmative action in higher education is intended to address past discrimination, but the result is fewer black college graduates than would otherwise exist. And so it goes with everything from soft-on-crime laws, which make black neighborhoods more dangerous, to policies that limit school choice out of a mistaken belief that charter schools and voucher programs harm the traditional public schools that most low-income students attend.",

            "description": "Recorded on February 21, 2019. What is \u201cfalse black power?\u201d According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Riley\u2019s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the \u201cGreat Society\u201d welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist community\u2019s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communities\u2019. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their children\u2019s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

We were sipping cocktails in the art-deco building with string theorist and science superstar Robbert Dijkgraaf as he told us all about the fundamental laws of Nature. Afterwards, cellist and composer Benjamin Glorieux performed a musical piece together with invited guests especially commissioned for the occasion, while live-video artist Klaas Verpoest accompanied them with his visual magic.What is string theory? What happens to stuff that falls inside a black hole? What are the fundamental building blocks of space and time? Did Nature have any choice in picking the fundamental laws of physics? What is the role of mathematics in physics?This talk by professor Robbert Dijkgraaf was recorded on 13 July 2019 at Flagey in Brussels.

He says intellectuals make alarming predictions using causes like global warming to create a need for their services.-----Thomas Sowell introduces his new book Intellectuals and Society and expounds on what he calls \"the fatal misstep of intellectuals\" -- the assumption that superior ability within a particular realm can be generalized as superior wisdom or morality over all. He offers examples of this misstep in areas as divergent as economics, the environment, and national defense.Finally, he warns us to resist the influence of intellectuals and points out that the demand for public intellectuals is largely manufactured by the public intellectuals themselves. - Hoover InstitutionThomas Sowell is an American economist, political writer, and commentator. He is currently a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. In 1990, he won the Francis Boyer Award, presented by the American Enterprise Institute. In 2002 he was awarded the National Humanities Medal for prolific scholarship melding history, economics, and political science.Peter M. Robinson is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, where he writes about business and politics, edits Hoover's quarterly journal, the Hoover Digest, and hosts Hoover's television program, Uncommon Knowledge.",

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

But, are we, as some claim, in the midst of the \"long boom,\" a new era of unparalleled prosperity driven by unprecedented technological change or are we merely enjoying a bull market that has yet to begin its inevitable correction? What does the current economic boom have in common with the \"Roaring Twenties\" and how can we avoid an economic contraction as severe as the Great Depression?",

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

He offers examples of this misstep in areas as divergent as economics, the environment, and national defense.Finally, he warns us to resist the influence of intellectuals and points out that the demand for public intellectuals is largely manufactured by the public intellectuals themselves. - Hoover InstitutionThomas Sowell is an American economist, political writer, and commentator. He is currently a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. In 1990, he won the Francis Boyer Award, presented by the American Enterprise Institute. In 2002 he was awarded the National Humanities Medal for prolific scholarship melding history, economics, and political science.Peter M.

            "description": "Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal authenticity\u201d during the campaign and how the media has a \u201chistorical amnesia\u201d of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump\u2019s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn\u2019t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that\u2019s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

            "description": "Recorded on April 23, 2020Victor Davis Hanson is both a classical scholar at the Hoover Institution and a farmer in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He\u2019s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

            "description": "Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

It's the latest example of Fox News\u2019 transformation from right-wing news network into full-on Republican campaign operation. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won\u2019t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

But thanks to Fox News, that\u2019s not always true. The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage.

Check them out here:  https://99percentinvisible.org/Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSome cities in Europe are undergoing a fascinating transformation: they\u2019re getting rid of all of their road signs.  That\u2019s thanks to a design concept called \u201cshared space,\u201d where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.\u00a0 There\u2019s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection,\u00a0in theory leading to safer travel. But by stripping cities of their traditional traffic control systems, they leave disabled residents in the dark \u2014 and that\u2019s sparked a powerful debate of how to balance ease of movement with all residents\u2019 needs.

            "description": "Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they\u2019re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it\u2019s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies.

            "description": "Trump has turned press conferences into a ritual of hate -- is it still worth watching?Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-labSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOThe White House press conference has always been a frustrating spectacle, with reporters trying to pry information from government officials who do everything in their power to avoid sharing too much information. But these press conferences are typically appreciated because of their symbolic value -- they reaffirm the democratic idea that the government must answer to the people.That symbolic value has changed under Trump, who uses press conferences to stage high profile fights with the press and mobilize his base.On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

Shows like Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, Saturday Night Live, and Late Night With Seth Meyers have enjoyed ratings boosts thanks to their regular lampooning of the Trump White House.But beyond the jokes and sight gags, political satirists have done an excellent job of seriously covering the Trump administration \u2014 sometimes even better than major TV news networks.

But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting. Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics. In the face of intense media attention, the Parkland students are putting on a masterclass in how to deal with bullies.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

            "description": "\u2026 and how it\u2019s getting what it wanted.On Oct. 9, 2019, Turkey launched an attack in northeastern Syria. Turkey made the move shortly after the US announced it would remove some of its troops from the region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan had his eyes on the region for years. Turkey, he argued, needed a \u201csafe zone\u201d to serve as a buffer against the Syrian War happening just across the border. Yet back home in Turkey, there were other factors at play that accelerated his calls for an invasion that involved Erdo\u011fan\u2019s own political survival.The move has recalibrated alliances in the Syrian War and added new uncertainty on the future of the region.

Check them out here:  https://99percentinvisible.org/Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSome cities in Europe are undergoing a fascinating transformation: they\u2019re getting rid of all of their road signs.  That\u2019s thanks to a design concept called \u201cshared space,\u201d where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.\u00a0 There\u2019s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection,\u00a0in theory leading to safer travel. But by stripping cities of their traditional traffic control systems, they leave disabled residents in the dark \u2014 and that\u2019s sparked a powerful debate of how to balance ease of movement with all residents\u2019 needs.

These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.The group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications. That financial allegiance means the NRA is similar to organizations like the Tobacco Institute -- an industry lobbying group primarily interested in protecting their product. So why do news networks keep inviting them to debate gun violence?Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting. Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics.

But these press conferences are typically appreciated because of their symbolic value -- they reaffirm the democratic idea that the government must answer to the people.That symbolic value has changed under Trump, who uses press conferences to stage high profile fights with the press and mobilize his base.On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies.

            "description": "Fox News was created to push right-wing nonsense to the mainstream, and now there\u2019s no escape.Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-labRead more about the hack gap on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/23/180044...We tend to assume that if a story is being covered by major news networks, it\u2019s because journalists have decided that the story is important. But thanks to Fox News, that\u2019s not always true. The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage. The result is a media ecosystem that advantages Republicans by paying disproportionate attention to right-wing talking points.

Countries, especially poor ones, can\u2019t function if there are larger countries pulling strings within their borders. And that\u2019s exactly what's happening in the Middle East.

But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting. Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics.

But thanks to Fox News, that\u2019s not always true. The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage. The result is a media ecosystem that advantages Republicans by paying disproportionate attention to right-wing talking points.

These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.The group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications. That financial allegiance means the NRA is similar to organizations like the Tobacco Institute -- an industry lobbying group primarily interested in protecting their product. So why do news networks keep inviting them to debate gun violence?Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

            "description": "Homelessness, hunger and shame: poverty is rampant in the richest country in the world. Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "description": "Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they\u2019re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it\u2019s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation.

But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting. Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics.

            "description": "Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they\u2019re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it\u2019s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists\u2019 call \u201casymmetrical polarization.\u201dThat asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they\u2019ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that\u2019s made it really easy for media outlets to blame \u201cboth sides\u201d for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks,\u201d journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they\u2019re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who\u2019s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann\u2019s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

            "description": "For more than 15 years, cameraman and ecologist John D. Liu has been working on his worldwide mission to green deserts and to restore biodiversity.It all started in 1995 when Liu filmed the Loess-plateau in China. He witnessed a local population who turned an area of almost the same size as The Netherlands from a dry, exhausted wasteland into one green oasis. This experience changed his life. From that moment on, Liu has been travelling all over the world to convince and inspire government leaders, policy-makers and farmers with his film material and knowledge. Liu diligently spreads the message that restoration of ecosystems is not only possible, but also economically very meaningful.Backlight accompanies Liu on his mission in Jordan and shows on the basis of Liu\u2019s own film material that a green future is possible worldwide.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2012.\u00a9 VPRO Backlight April 2012On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

            "description": "This half hour video documents the ongoing work of Permaculture Gurus, Geoff and Nadia Lawton, in the Dead Sea Valley. It begins with the famous original 'Greening the Desert' five minute video clip, and then continues into Part II, a 2009 update to the 2001 original. You'll get to see and learn about the original Greening the Desert site and see some of the spin-off effects of its influence throughout Jordan.When there\u2019s no soil, no water, no shade, and where the sun beats down on you to the tune of over 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F), the word \u2018poverty\u2019 begins to take on a whole new meaning. It is distinct and surreal. It\u2019s a land of dust, flies, intense heat and almost complete dependency on supply lines outside of ones control. This is the remains of what was once called the \u2018fertile crescent\u2019. It is the result of thousands of years of abuse. It is a glimpse at a world where the environment \u2013 whose services provide for all human need \u2013 has all but completely abandoned us. This is a glimpse at the world our consumer society is inexorably moving towards, as our exponential-growth culture gorges itself at ever-increasing rates.The original Greening the Desert video clip has been watched hundreds of thousands of times and has been posted to countless blogs and web pages in the datasphere. Although only five minutes long, it has inspired people around the globe, daring the lucid ones amongst us, those who can see the writing on the wall, to begin to hope and believe in an abundant future \u2013 a future where our survival doesn\u2019t have to be based on undermining and depleting the very resources of soil, water, phosphorus, etc. that we depend on. The work profiled in that clip demonstrates that humanity can be a positive element within the biosphere. Man doesn\u2019t have to destroy. Man can repair.For more information visit: http://permaculturenews.org/2009/12/1...",

            "description": "Living Soil: A DocumentaryOur soils support 95 percent of all food production, and by 2060, our soils will be asked to give us as much food as we have consumed in the last 500 years. They filter our water. They are one of our most cost-effective reservoirs for sequestering carbon. They are our foundation for biodiversity. And they are vibrantly alive, teeming with 10,000 pounds of biological life in every acre. Yet in the last 150 years, we\u2019ve lost half of the basic building block that makes soil productive. The societal and environmental costs of soil loss and degradation in the United States alone are now estimated to be as high as $85 billion every single year. Like any relationship, our living soil needs our tenderness. It\u2019s time we changed everything we thought we knew about soil. Let\u2019s make this the century of living soil.This 60-minute documentary features innovative farmers and soil health experts from throughout the U.S. Accompanying lesson plans for college and high school students will can also be found on this site. \"Living Soil\" was directed by Chelsea Myers and Tiny Attic Productions based in Columbia, Missouri, and produced by the Soil Health Institute through the generous support of The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation.

Throughout the year the group build tiny houses, plant veggie gardens, practice simple living and permaculture principles, and discover the challenges of living in community. This documentary, our very first!, was shot while we were living on the property for the entire year as part of the community.

            "description": "\"Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,\" begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

He witnessed a local population who turned an area of almost the same size as The Netherlands from a dry, exhausted wasteland into one green oasis. This experience changed his life. From that moment on, Liu has been travelling all over the world to convince and inspire government leaders, policy-makers and farmers with his film material and knowledge. Liu diligently spreads the message that restoration of ecosystems is not only possible, but also economically very meaningful.Backlight accompanies Liu on his mission in Jordan and shows on the basis of Liu\u2019s own film material that a green future is possible worldwide.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2012.\u00a9 VPRO Backlight April 2012On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

            "description": "\"Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,\" begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

            "description": "Living Soil: A DocumentaryOur soils support 95 percent of all food production, and by 2060, our soils will be asked to give us as much food as we have consumed in the last 500 years. They filter our water. They are one of our most cost-effective reservoirs for sequestering carbon. They are our foundation for biodiversity. And they are vibrantly alive, teeming with 10,000 pounds of biological life in every acre. Yet in the last 150 years, we\u2019ve lost half of the basic building block that makes soil productive. The societal and environmental costs of soil loss and degradation in the United States alone are now estimated to be as high as $85 billion every single year. Like any relationship, our living soil needs our tenderness. It\u2019s time we changed everything we thought we knew about soil. Let\u2019s make this the century of living soil.This 60-minute documentary features innovative farmers and soil health experts from throughout the U.S. Accompanying lesson plans for college and high school students will can also be found on this site. \"Living Soil\" was directed by Chelsea Myers and Tiny Attic Productions based in Columbia, Missouri, and produced by the Soil Health Institute through the generous support of The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation.

            "description": "This half hour video documents the ongoing work of Permaculture Gurus, Geoff and Nadia Lawton, in the Dead Sea Valley. It begins with the famous original 'Greening the Desert' five minute video clip, and then continues into Part II, a 2009 update to the 2001 original. You'll get to see and learn about the original Greening the Desert site and see some of the spin-off effects of its influence throughout Jordan.When there\u2019s no soil, no water, no shade, and where the sun beats down on you to the tune of over 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F), the word \u2018poverty\u2019 begins to take on a whole new meaning. It is distinct and surreal. It\u2019s a land of dust, flies, intense heat and almost complete dependency on supply lines outside of ones control. This is the remains of what was once called the \u2018fertile crescent\u2019. It is the result of thousands of years of abuse. It is a glimpse at a world where the environment \u2013 whose services provide for all human need \u2013 has all but completely abandoned us. This is a glimpse at the world our consumer society is inexorably moving towards, as our exponential-growth culture gorges itself at ever-increasing rates.The original Greening the Desert video clip has been watched hundreds of thousands of times and has been posted to countless blogs and web pages in the datasphere. Although only five minutes long, it has inspired people around the globe, daring the lucid ones amongst us, those who can see the writing on the wall, to begin to hope and believe in an abundant future \u2013 a future where our survival doesn\u2019t have to be based on undermining and depleting the very resources of soil, water, phosphorus, etc. that we depend on. The work profiled in that clip demonstrates that humanity can be a positive element within the biosphere. Man doesn\u2019t have to destroy. Man can repair.For more information visit: http://permaculturenews.org/2009/12/1...",

            "description": "For more than 15 years, cameraman and ecologist John D. Liu has been working on his worldwide mission to green deserts and to restore biodiversity.It all started in 1995 when Liu filmed the Loess-plateau in China. He witnessed a local population who turned an area of almost the same size as The Netherlands from a dry, exhausted wasteland into one green oasis. This experience changed his life. From that moment on, Liu has been travelling all over the world to convince and inspire government leaders, policy-makers and farmers with his film material and knowledge. Liu diligently spreads the message that restoration of ecosystems is not only possible, but also economically very meaningful.Backlight accompanies Liu on his mission in Jordan and shows on the basis of Liu\u2019s own film material that a green future is possible worldwide.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2012.\u00a9 VPRO Backlight April 2012On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

This is the video of my design process and farm in Prior Lake, Mn in 2014. Since then I have worked in many countries and climates developing designs using the the fully developed SouthWoods Design Process. It doesn't matter where I go, the process of site assessment, data collection, and understanding the climate and culture serves to develop design solutions that are holistic and ecologically sound. With the changes in climate patterns, it is important that the design be climate resilient, sufficient for supporting needed harvests,  and optimized for available resources.

            "description": "\u201cYou must plant the rain before you plant a seed or tree!\u201d proclaimed rain farmer Mr. Zephaniah Phiri Maseko of Zimbabwe. By doing just that, he and his family turned a wasteland into an oasis, raised groundwater and well levels even in dry years, reduced flooding in wet years, and enhanced the fertility of the soils. This inspiring story will be shared along with the strategies used, and more importantly, the guiding principles that informed the choice, placement, and implementation of these strategies into a more integrated and productive system. These principles work in any climate experiencing a dry season or drought. And they help us see and act more holistically by asking us questions that direct our attention to important aspects of water and fertility systems we might otherwise overlook.Presenter:\u00a0Brad Lancaster is a dynamic teacher, consultant, and designer of regenerative systems that sustainably enhance local resources and our global potential.

And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

            "description": "For more than 15 years, cameraman and ecologist John D. Liu has been working on his worldwide mission to green deserts and to restore biodiversity.It all started in 1995 when Liu filmed the Loess-plateau in China. He witnessed a local population who turned an area of almost the same size as The Netherlands from a dry, exhausted wasteland into one green oasis. This experience changed his life. From that moment on, Liu has been travelling all over the world to convince and inspire government leaders, policy-makers and farmers with his film material and knowledge. Liu diligently spreads the message that restoration of ecosystems is not only possible, but also economically very meaningful.Backlight accompanies Liu on his mission in Jordan and shows on the basis of Liu\u2019s own film material that a green future is possible worldwide.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2012.\u00a9 VPRO Backlight April 2012On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

            "description": "This mysterious and picturesque country located between India and China was closed for tourists until 1974. Today, everyone who\u2019s ready to go through a lot of formalities and has enough money can visit Bhutan. Ans even though the borders are open, the King still tries to restrict the number of tourists using many different methods.This is a country that decided to measure national happiness, has completely free healthcare, and nobody living on the streets. Sounds unbelievable, but this is all true about Bhutan, and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. So, wanna know why all the people who live in Bhutan are so happy? Let's find out more about their traditions and numerous bans.Other videos you might like:What Every Country In the World Is Best At? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkLsA...32 Creative World Flags Made by True Geniuses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Cd9...16 Crazy Things That Are Considered Normal In Other Countries https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7vz0...TIMESTAMPS:No homeless people at all 0:31Free healthcare 0:48Unplugged 1:10National Dress Code 1:44No Smoking! 2:14Ecology is everything 2:48They like it hot! 3:31Touring obstacles 4:07Ladies first 5:00100% Organic? 5:19They keep food on the roof 6:12Only the best pilots are allowed to fly to Bhutan 6:11Wedding rules 7:00The Ministry of Happiness 7:47The road less traveled 8:42Gingerbread-like houses 9:08#Bhutan #traveling #brightsidePreview photo credit: King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema, BHUTAN: By NIV/SIPA/EAST NEWS, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/pict...Animation is created by Bright Side.Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- If a person loses their home, they just need to go to the king and he\u2019ll give them a plot of land where they can build a house to live in and plant a garden to eat from.- Each Bhutanese resident has the right to free medical care. The country\u2019s Ministry of Health has made it their goal to become \u201cA nation with the best health.\u201d- The Bhutanese people take their traditions and unique culture very seriously, and the king took great measures to protect his people from outside influences.- Speaking of traditions, Bhutanese people are required to wear traditional clothes in public. This nationwide dress code has existed for over 400 years.- In 2010, the king enacted a law prohibiting the cultivation, harvest, and sale of tobacco, making Bhutan the first country in the world with a total ban on tobacco. It\u2019s impossible to buy it there, and you can\u2019t smoke in public areas. - Bhutan is really concerned about ecology and nature. According to a local law, at least 60% of the country\u2019s total area must be covered with woods.- The most popular ingredient in almost every Bhutanese dish is chilies. The Tourism Council even notes \u201cBhutanese people would not enjoy a meal that was not spicy.\u201d- You can only go to Bhutan in groups of 3 or more. All documents and visas are issued by a state-appointed company. - All property and belongings like their homes, cattle, and land go to the eldest daughter, not son. Men are expected to earn their own fortunes.- It\u2019s already illegal to import or use any chemical products there whatsoever. Everything they use is cultivated within the country and is all-natural. - Not every pilot can maneuver between mountaintops and land on a 6,500-foot-long highway right by people\u2019s houses. Add strong winds to the challenge, and you\u2019ll understand why take-offs and landings are only allowed during daylight hours. And there are only 8 pilots in the world that can do this. - If you visit Bhutan, you may fall in love with the land, but try not to fall for a local or else you\u2019ll get your heart broken. It\u2019s prohibited to marry foreigners. - In 2008, the Gross National Happiness Committee was formed in Bhutan to take care of the people\u2019s inner peace. - All the road signs in Bhutan are drawn by hand. Thiumphu, the country\u2019s capital, is the only one in the world that has no traffic lights at all. - Bhutanese people love to decorate their homes. They draw birds, animals, and different patterns on the walls, making them look like real-life gingerbread houses.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",

In combination with a proper 4 day trekking adventure in the Himalayas along the Druk Path Bhutan simply blew me away.With this video I give you an introduction to traveling and things to do in Bhutan, I explain why the Bhutan visa has such a high price tag and why it is only possible to explore the country on a tour. I take you with me on the demanding Druk Path trek and show you around all the major sights in Thimphu, Punakha and Paro including the hike up to the popular Tiger\u2019s Nest monastery.

            "description": "There are a lot of countries that are famous all over the world for some peculiarities. Japan is, probably one of the most exotic ones. It is known as the Land of the Rising Sun, but it could also be called the Land of singing toilets, the country of the blue traffic light, or the country of vending machines. Really, Japan is a unique country, different from the rest of the world. Japanese farmers grow square watermelons, people park and lock their umbrella before going inside a building and there\u2019s a whole chain of restaurants all over the country where they serve only canned food. In short, there are so many things that make Japan a whole other world.

Mostly because they save time for people who work late hours, which is a pretty common thing there.- In 2015, Godzilla was granted citizenship in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward. - Punctuality is a really big thing there, and train stations do everything possible to avoid a delay.-  While in many other countries slurping is considered rude, in Japan it\u2019s a way to show your appreciation of the dish.- Japanese people don't eat mayo with salads, meat, and sandwiches; in Japan, people usually use it as a topping for ice-cream or on pancakes. - World\u2019s shortest escalator is in the basement of More\u2019s Department Store, which is located in the city of Kawasaki. The escalator has only 5 steps and is only 33 inches tall. - The village of Nagoro used to have a population of 300 people, but less than 40 residents live there now. A local artist, Tsukimi Ayano, made over 300 life-size dolls, most of which look like former residents; and they\u2019re located in various states of action. - It\u2019s common for Japanese culture to avoid the number 4 because it\u2019s considered to be very unlucky. - They use a blue color instead of green for traffic lights. The reason for that hides in their language: historically, there was only one word for both colors.- Japanese kids learn how to clean in many schools because it\u2019s a part of their education. - Toilets in Japan are very high-tech. To use one, a person should know what all those buttons are for.-  Since Japan is a densely-populated country, they don\u2019t like to waste space. That\u2019s why their parking lots have a smart system. They\u2019re designed like multi-level garages.Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once.

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.\" With Darwin's theory of evolution as a point of departure, he takes scientists to task for their antireligious assumptions and explores the conflict between the scientific community and those with firmly held religious beliefs.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

            "description": "Science writer, biologist, neuroscientist, and stress expert Dr. Robert Sapolsky presents the inaugural Fenton-Rhodes Lecture on Proactve Wellness.  Sapolsky states that our bodies' stress response evolved to help us get out of short-term physical emergencies - if a lion is chasing you, you run. But such reactions, he points out, compromise long-term physical health in favor of immediate self-preservation. Unfortunately, when confronted with purely psychological stressors, such as troubleshooting the fax machine, modern humans turn on the same stress response. \"If you turn it on for too long,\" notes Sapolsky, \"you get sick.\" Sapolsky regards this sobering news with characteristic good humor, finding hope in \"our own capacity to prevent some of these problems... in the small steps with which we live our everyday lives.\"This lecture was recorded on September 22, 2016 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts' Colwell Playhouse as part of the Pygmalion TechFest",

Having presented at over 500 colleges and Universities nationwide, hundreds of leadership symposiums, and countless local and regional organizations, Adam Carroll\u2019s message of Building A Bigger Life, Not a Bigger Lifestyle has been heard by over 200,000+ people.In early 2014, Adam successfully crowd-funded a documentary on student loan debt, raising nearly $70,000 in 45 days. The film, Broke Busted & Disgusted is due out in early 2015 and is already garnering critical acclaim. The mission of the film is to start a national debate about changing the way we fund college and not crippling 20 somethings with mountains of debt.Adam\u2019s core message is we are all after the same thing \u2013 to relentlessly pursue our passions, live simply and happily, and make a difference to those around us.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

From Blue Tooth to automobile remotes, PCs, and \"secure\" credit cards, Hacker extraordinaire shows how nearly every secure system is vulnerable.  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

            "description": "In this talk Mark shares a dramatic and powerful system that takes productivity thinking to whole new and terrifying level, allowing a person to achieve almost any goal they set themselves with rapid speed. The secret to this type of exponential success? Bin your \u2018affirmations\u2019 and \u2018goals\u2019 and instead embrace fear as your friend by making irreversible decisions. Instead of hapless resolutions members of the \"Lock-In\" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The \u201cLock-In\" system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives. Many of the most successful people in history have used its phenomenal power to create extraordinary success. Think you're hardcore enough? Then enter the Cult of Extreme Productivity Mark Adams is Vice President and Head of Innovation at VICE, which has come from humble beginnings as a print magazine to digitally transform into a 5 billion dollar youth media empire. In this talk, Mark describes the cult of extreme productivity that he became part of alongside his brother. The cult is all about making irreversible decisions that make \u201cmanifesting\u201d your dreams the only option because not achieving it would create indescribable suffering. This is the second time Mark has done a TEDx talk. The first time his talk was banned. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

John Ratcliffe, appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing. Ratcliffe was nominated for the same post last year but withdrew after even GOP lawmakers said he was too partisan and inexperienced. 'Never has anyone more unqualified been formally nominated by a President to lead the U.S. Intelligence Community,' said Larry Pfeiffer, former CIA chief of staff. Ratcliffe has repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated claims about a 'deep state' and his Twitter account follows a number of fringe activists who promote the 'the outlandish QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that the world is run by a cabal of Democratic pedophile-cannibals,' the Daily Beast reports.\u00bb Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe\u00bb Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis#Intelligence #Senate #JohnRatcliffe #News #NowThis #NowThisNewsConnect with NowThis\u00bb Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook\u00bb Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter\u00bb Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram\u00bb Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday\u2019s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria\u2019s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew\u2019s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy \u2013 the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic \u2013 is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday\u2019s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.\u20148:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February\u2019s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.\u20147:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%\u20146:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",

            "description": "TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL SPY CHIEF NOMINEE FACES SENATE: Pres. Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, Texas GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe, appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing. Ratcliffe was nominated for the same post last year but withdrew after even GOP lawmakers said he was too partisan and inexperienced. 'Never has anyone more unqualified been formally nominated by a President to lead the U.S. Intelligence Community,' said Larry Pfeiffer, former CIA chief of staff. Ratcliffe has repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated claims about a 'deep state' and his Twitter account follows a number of fringe activists who promote the 'the outlandish QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that the world is run by a cabal of Democratic pedophile-cannibals,' the Daily Beast reports.\u00bb Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe\u00bb Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis#Intelligence #Senate #JohnRatcliffe #News #NowThis #NowThisNewsConnect with NowThis\u00bb Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook\u00bb Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter\u00bb Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram\u00bb Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

The U.S. patent office has refused to let Booking.com trademark its company name, arguing that brands can't protect a generic term like 'hotels' by combining it with a generic internet domain like '.com.' Booking.com argues that consumers aren't confused and know it's a specific brand.

John Ratcliffe, appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing. Ratcliffe was nominated for the same post last year but withdrew after even GOP lawmakers said he was too partisan and inexperienced. 'Never has anyone more unqualified been formally nominated by a President to lead the U.S. Intelligence Community,' said Larry Pfeiffer, former CIA chief of staff. Ratcliffe has repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated claims about a 'deep state' and his Twitter account follows a number of fringe activists who promote the 'the outlandish QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that the world is run by a cabal of Democratic pedophile-cannibals,' the Daily Beast reports.\u00bb Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe\u00bb Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThis#Intelligence #Senate #JohnRatcliffe #News #NowThis #NowThisNewsConnect with NowThis\u00bb Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook\u00bb Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter\u00bb Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram\u00bb Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.
