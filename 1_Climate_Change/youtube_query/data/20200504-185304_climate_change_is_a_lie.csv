Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4672170,"49,895","3,399","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How Microwaving Grapes Makes Plasma,Education,9631892,"208,270","5,587","A bisected grape in the microwave makes plasma. But how does it work? A grape is the right size and refractive index to trap microwaves inside it. When you place two (or two halves) close together the fields interact with each other creating a maximum of electromagnetic energy where they touch. This creates heating, sparks, and plasma, which is further fed with energy directly by the microwaves.Huge thanks to Hamza Khattak, Prof. Pablo Bianucci and Prof. Aaron Slepkov (unavailable for the call) for chatting to me and helping me understand the physics of this cool phenomenon.Linking plasma formation in grapes to microwave resonances of aqueous dimershttps://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/...Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, James M Nicholson, Michael Krugman, Nathan Hansen, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance ShepherdThanks also to Steve Bosi, my original plasma collaborator.Animations by Alan ChamberlainMusic from http://epidemicsound.com ""Seaweed""",PT8M16S,2/18/19,2/18/19,131321,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,wCrtk-pyP0I,0,

Prince: Purple Reign (FULL DOCUMENTARY),Film & Animation,560077,"5,525",367,"In recent times, music lovers have been confounded with the tragic and shocking news that some of their most beloved stars had passed away in controversial circumstances. The music world has again been stunned by the sudden and tragic news that Prince, the legendary musician, died at his home in Minneapolis at the age of just 57, and it was recently confirmed the singer died of an opioid overdose. He was one of the most naturally gifted artists of all time, and also one of the most mysterious. In the Eighties, at a time when other megastars such as Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, and Madonna, were delivering an album every three years or so, Prince remained prolific to an almost inhuman degree. A byproduct of his inexhaustible output was Prince's tendency toward wayward, self-indulgent career moves that sometimes alienated even his most ardent supporters. His influence is unparalleled, and his legacy will live on through his inspirational music. In this fascinating documentary, we take an in depth look into the life and times of one of music’s greatest performers…Prince.",PT44M36S,8/23/17,8/23/17,121323,Free Films Powered By 1091,/channel/UCX1nchEcBshItKBeJvH-YMw,UCX1nchEcBshItKBeJvH-YMw,19,vv1O62kxlbw,0,

It's the latest example of Fox News’ transformation from right-wing news network into full-on Republican campaign operation. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation.

The Most Radioactive Places on Earth,Education,14632901,"330,681","5,703","Who on Earth is exposed to the most ionizing radiation?Check out Audible: http://bit.ly/AudibleVeI'm filming a documentary for TV about how Uranium and radioactivity have shaped the modern world. It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.Notes about measuring radiation:Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.https://xkcd.com/radiation/DOSES MAY VARYThe level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).Estimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.The most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video.

"How to NEVER Get Sick Again - The WIM HOF ""Iceman"" Method - #NeverSick",Education,3040410,"69,867","2,710","✎  WIM HOF ""Iceman"" Method: He's nicknamed ""The Iceman"" for his ability to withstand extreme cold which he assigns to exposure to cold, meditation and breathing techniques. Hof has set out to spread the potential health benefits of his breathing techniques, working closely with scientists around the world to prove that the Wim Hof Method works. It is thought from current studies that by consciously hyperventilating Wim can increase his heart rate, adrenalin levels and blood alkalinity. To learn more about the Wim Hof Method check out: http://www.wimhofmethod.com ❤ HELP TRANSLATE THIS VIDEO ❤If you loved this video, help people in other countries enjoy it too by making captions for it. Spread the love and impact. https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_vid...✔ Warning: The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced. Never practice the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went to far. Take a step back next time.The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practiced responsible, there is a risk of hypothermia. Do not practice the method during pregnancy or when having epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method.Source: wimhofmethod.com★ MORE RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU ★If you enjoyed this video, you may enjoy these other videos from Evan Carmichael:• Warren Buffett's Top 10 Rules For Success - https://youtu.be/iEgu6p_frmE• Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki's Top 10 Rules For Success - https://youtu.be/yVfBdFs4_S8• Bob Proctor's Top 10 Rules For Success - https://youtu.be/uLn6lpP8YmA♛ BUY MY BOOK, CHANGE YOUR LIFE  ♛Some used the ideas in this book to build multi-billion-dollar businesses.

One Way To Find Out How Much Sleep You Actually Need (animated),Education,139831,"6,067",174,"Support Better Than Yesterday:https://www.buymeacoffee.com/uQKkXCF6BOne Way To Find Out How Much Sleep You Actually Need (animated)One of the problems in today's society is that we're purposely getting less sleep than our bodies need. Usually it's because we have to go to work, or go to school. And this is bad, as we're sacrificing our health in return. Because of that, getting enough sleep can be a huge hidden advantage for you. Imagine having your brain function more efficiently than of those around you. That's what the right amount of sleep will get you. Better mood, better focus, ability to think clearly etc.But getting sufficient sleep for just one night isn't enough. You need to get enough sleep every single night to reap these benefits.Now you might be wondering, exactly how much sleep should you be getting.The standard prescription is 7-9 hours, but how do you know where exactly you personally fall in that range?First you need to understand that you, as an individual, are completely unique.And the amount of sleep your body requires also depends on many different external factors.That means there isn't an exact amount of sleep you should be getting, as the amount actually changes from day to day.In this video I'll explain how to find out, how much sleep YOU PERSONALLY need.#sleep #betterthanyesterday #health",PT8M38S,1/31/19,1/31/19,113333,Better Than Yesterday,/channel/UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,19,5Vd9G41pXh8,0,
Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,News & Politics,2385406,"78,676","44,335","Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann’s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",PT14M49S,9/19/19,9/19/19,131121,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,1VPfZ_XzisU,0,

Dating as we know it didn’t really start until the Industrial Revolution when young people left farms and small towns to flock to cities for work. They got jobs in factories, bars, and restaurants and being away from their families for the first time offered them the freedom to mix and match with other young people. Ever since then the way single people have gotten together has been dictated by the ups and downs of the economy in the United States.

Basically you don't sleep for one day, and you go to bed at the desired time the next day.However that's like putting a band-aid on a bigger problem. It's also one of the worst things you can do for your health, even if the end goal is a healthy sleep schedule.Rather than pulling an all-nighter, you should focus on fixing your sleep habits.It's good to to understand how your body knows when it's time to wake up or go to sleep.

But thanks to Fox News, that’s not always true. The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage. The result is a media ecosystem that advantages Republicans by paying disproportionate attention to right-wing talking points.

I Waterproofed Myself With Aerogel!,Education,17729815,"399,951","9,413","Aerogel has extraordinary properties but it can be tough to work with. This video looks at modifying aerogels to take advantage of their unique characteristics.Subscribe to Veritasium: https://ve42.co/subHuge thanks to Dr. Stephen Steiner and the crew at Aerogel Technologies. To find out more or buy your own aerogel sample, check out: http://www.aerogeltechnologies.com/Thanks to Dr. Steven Jones and Dr. Mihail Petkov at NASA's Jet Propulsion LaboratoryAnd thanks to FLIR for loaning us the awesome high definition thermal camera. The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.comAerogel’s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by ‘drying out insects’ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.Special thanks to all my Patreon supporters especially those who contributed feedback to an earlier draft of this video:a human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzeziński, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Zürcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias Göransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick Čalija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252Filmed by Paul GramagliaThumbnail by Ignat BerbeciAnimations by Catherine ChooljianMusic from https://epidemicsound.com “Tonic Zone” “Betelgeuse” “Insidious Mice” “Seaweed” “It’s not that serious” “Platin00m - Sum It”This is an educational, scientific video.",PT12M22S,6/21/19,6/21/19,131133,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,GcdB5bFwio4,0,

Rowley Training Center in Laurel, Maryland, where he observed recruits at various stages of training.According to the Secret Service, about one in every 100 applicants makes it through the agency's intense vetting process to become a recruit. The base salary for new agents and officers is $47,000 per year.After spending three months at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in either Artesia, New Mexico or Glynco, Georgia, recruits return to Laurel for three more months of Secret Service-specific training.Although we were allowed to film inside the academy, much of the training remained secret. According to the training center's deputy chief, Michael Buck, this was intended to avoid ""giving people specifics into our protective methodologies ... we don't advertise our playbook.""UPDATE: In the video, we identify a car as a Dodge Challenger, when what is seen on screen is a Dodge Charger.

My descent into America's neo-Nazi movement & how I got out | Christian Picciolini | TEDxMileHigh,Nonprofits & Activism,1941259,"58,674","3,251","At 14-years-old, Christian Picciolini went from naive teenager to white supremacist, and soon, the leader of America’s first neo-Nazi skinhead gang. How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement—and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017. Christian lives in Chicago. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.Music from https://epidemicsound.com ""The Longest Rest"" ""A Sound Foundation"" ""Seaweed""",PT12M51S,12/6/19,12/6/19,133221,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,20,fDek6cYijxI,0,

Why the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans Don't Mix,Howto & Style,10115721,"108,760","5,216","When you look at the seas and oceans on the map you might think that they just flow into each other. It seems like there’s only one big ocean, and people just gave different names to its parts. Well, you’ll be amazed at how vivid the borders between them are!The border between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is like a line between 2 worlds. It looks as if the two oceans meet at an invisible wall which does not let them flow into each other and mix their waters. Why on Earth does it happen? We know for sure there is no invisible wall inside, and water is water. So what could interfere with its mixing?Other videos you might like:If You See Square Waves, Get Out of the Water! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWdb5...What Would a Trip to the Mariana Trench Be Like? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeW1D...It Takes Hundreds of Lives a Year, But Only 5% Know About It https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IFa...TIMESTAMPS:Water can be different too! 0:40What are haloclines? 1:03The most spectacular clines on the planet:- The North and Baltic Seas 4:38- The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean 5:04- The Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean 5:16- The Surinam River and the Atlantic Ocean 5:36- The Uruguay River and its afflux 5:43- The Rio Negro and Solimões Rivers 5:58- Mosel and Rhein 6:19- Ilz, Danube, and Inn 6:30- Alaknanda and Bhagirathi Rivers 6:48- Irtysh and Ulba 6:56- The Jialing and Yangtze Rivers 7:11- Irtysh and Om 7:20- Chuya and Katun rivers 7:20- The Green and Colorado rivers 7:50- The Rhone and Arve rivers 8:10#oceans #rivers #brightsideSUMMARY:- Pacific oceans have different density and chemical make-up, the level of salinity and other qualities. One can see by their color that they are far from being the same.- Haloclines – borders between waters with different salinity – are the most spectacular, and this is what we see when the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans meet. - Haloclines appear when water in one ocean or sea is at least 5 times saltier than in the other. - Another important difference between the two oceans' water is the strength of molecules' connection, or surface tensile strength. - Maybe they could gradually start mixing with time, but as the flows in them have opposite directions, they just don’t have time to do this.- There are also thermoclines – borders between water of different temperatures, like the warm water of Gulf Stream and much colder North Atlantic Ocean. - The North and Baltic Seas meet near the Danish city of Skagen. The water in them does not mix because of different density. - The Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean meet at the Strait of Gibraltar and have a different density and salinity, so their water does not mix too.- The Uruguay River and its afflux meet in Misiones province in Argentina. One of them is cleaned to be used in agriculture, and the other gets almost red because of loam during rainy seasons.- Mosel and Rhein meet in Koblenz, Germany. Rheine has lighter water and Mosel – darker. - Alaknanda and Bhagirathi Rivers meet in India. Alaknanda is dark and Bhagirathi is light. - The Jialing and Yangtze Rivers meet in Chongqing, China. The Jialing is clean and the Yangtze is brown.- The water of the Chuya has an unusual cloudy white color here and looks dense and thick. Katun is clean and turquoise. Flowing into each other they form a single two-colored flow that does not mix for some time. - The Rhone and Arve rivers flow into each other in Geneva, Switzerland. The Rhone is a pure river that flows out of the lake of Geneva, the Arve is cloudy as it gets its water from glaciers of the Chamonix valley.

When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera — then known as “el Rapido”— was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

"Why Are 96,000,000 Black Balls on This Reservoir?",Education,44528507,"537,301","25,437","I took a boat through 96 million black plastic balls on the Los Angeles reservoir to find out why they're there. The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com ""Colorful Animation 4"" ""Seaweed""And from Kevin MacLeod ""Marty Gots a Plan""This is an educational video about the science of water quality.",PT12M7S,5/10/19,5/10/19,13111,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,uxPdPpi5W4o,0,

I guarantee, that this will be the best motivational video that you will see today, It’s not like the “Fake” motivational videos out there on YouTube. It’s literally impossible, to not be motivated if you implement this habit. We all struggle with motivation from time to time, it’s not bad to admit this. But it is bad, to allow yourself to stay unmotivated. There are many people who talk about motivation, as if it’s something that you get. But we have to realize, that motivation is just an emotion, and all emotions are transient, meaning they come and they go. So, you can rely on motivation, because it comes and it goes. Implementing this strategy will also force you to be self disciplined, because you really do have no other option.

Male recruits must be able to do 3 pull-ups or 34 push-ups & female recruits must be able to do 1 pull-up or 15 push-ups.  Both are required to do 44 crunches in 2 minutes and run 1.5 miles in under 13:30 for men and 15 minutes for women. Recruits are advised to report to training in much better shape, as the IST run is only half the distance Physical Fitness Test required of all recruits prior to graduation.Incentive Training in Marine Corps boot camp is common if they don’t meet standards for Marine Corps training.Grass Week is also called “snap in”. The recruits spend time practicing their firing positions, also called “snapping in”. In Marine Corps Basic Warrior Training, or BWT, recruits learn the fundamentals of combat; they sleep in the field and eat MRE’s. The Crucible is the defining moment of USMC bootcamp.

Marine recruits must meet standards to qualify in Marine Corps marksmanship.Marine Corps boot camp Phase 4. During Phase 4, the new Marines begin to transition from their roles as recruits into that of United States Marines. During this phase new Marines now call their Drill Instructors by their rank. Instead of “Sir” or “Ma’am,” it is “Sgt” or “SSgt”. The Drill Instructors continue mentoring the new Marines by conducting discussion periods on critical topics that will help the new Marines to be successful in their transition to the operational forces.Battalion Commander’s Inspection in Marine Corps Recruit Training in 2019.The Battalion Commander’s Inspection is the final opportunity for the new Marines to be evaluated prior to graduation. As in previous inspections, they are measured on their appearance, but more importantly, the Battalion Commander is evaluating them on their confidence, character, and whether or not they embody the Marine Corps’ Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment.Marine Corps Family DayOn Family Day excited families line the streets and try to catch a glimpse of their Marine running by in formation. Family Day starts off with a motivational run, referred to as the “MOT Run” throughout the Depot.

Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end?

Why Do Venomous Animals Live In Warm Climates?,Education,4446976,"63,930","1,977","As a Canadian-Australian, I have always wondered why it is that Australia has so many venomous animals that can kill you while Canada has virtually none.Subscribe to Veritasium - it's free! http://bit.ly/YSWpWmBut it's not just Australia - it seems like all beautiful, warm places are cursed with venomous native species. So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?I asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally ""sit and wait"" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.Special thanks to Prof. Rick Shine, Prof. Dieter Hochuli, Prof. Roger Lowe, Prof. Martyn Poliakoff and Taronga Zoo, especially Joe Haddock and Dean Purcell.Cinematography by Charles Clement",PT11M40S,2/6/13,2/6/13,1313,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,myh94hpFmJY,1,0
I See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying | Dr. Christopher Kerr | TEDxBuffalo,Nonprofits & Activism,2613503,"36,851","1,242","Dr. Christopher Kerr speaks at a 2015 TEDx event Buffalo, New York.Dr. Christopher W. Kerr is the Chief Medical Officer at The Center for Hospice and Palliative Care, where he has worked since 1999.

North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,Education,5680680,"39,348","3,173","North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator’s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Can You Swim in Shade Balls?,Education,15811577,"313,127","14,761","I bought 10,000 shade balls and tried to swim in them. They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.Get a signed shade ball by supporting Veritasium: https://ve42.co/patreonReceiving a shade ball:1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiersMy sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.Huge thanks to:Jordan Schnabel and Cristian Carretero for filming and swimming and providing lifeguard services.Raquel Nuno for filming and putting up with me.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Music from https://epidemicsound.com ""Dubstep Mammoth 2"" ""Finally Here (Instrumental)"" ""The Last Arrival"" ""Sundown Love (Instrumental)""",PT10M42S,6/13/19,6/13/19,131111,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,BZbChKzedEk,0,

Why Kavanaugh's accusers can't remember everything,News & Politics,1067875,"29,009","14,521","We expect Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh’s other accusers to perfectly remember the details of what happened to them. But that’s not how memory works, and fixating on the gaps in victims’ memories makes it harder for us to take credible allegations seriously. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOIn the weeks since Prof. Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a high school gathering, media coverage has focused heavily on Ford’s memories. Ford admits that she can’t remember key details about the incident, including whose house it took place at and how she got home afterward.Those gaps in her memory have led many of her critics to argue that Ford isn’t credible. Fox News in particular has seized on holes in Ford’s account to raise doubts about her allegations , even floating the theory that Ford may be confusing Kavanaugh for a doppelganger.But forgetting non-essential details is not unusual for trauma survivors. As my colleague Brian Resnick has explained, human memory is notoriously faulty. We often forget or misremember details about our experiences, even if we initially perceived them clearly. That’s especially true for trauma survivors -- like victims of sexual assault. When humans experience intense trauma, our brains have a tendency to hyper-focus on certain pieces of information while ignoring non-essential details. A victim of sexual assault might vividly remember her attacker’s cologne but struggle to remember the layout of the room she was in or what happened in the hours after the attack. Ford, for example, claims to vividly remember the “uproarious laughter” that she heard between Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge while she was being assaulted.In other words, critics who fixate on gaps in Ford’s memory are likely holding trauma survivors to a standard they won’t be able to meet.

It's where I found out about The 2 Minute Rule.US: https://amzn.to/2nNYA1nEU: https://amzn.to/2miAV8LBreak Your Mental Resistance With The 2 Minute Rule (animated)Why is it so hard to follow up on our new habits?One of the reasons is that the habit we're trying to form can seem a little overwhelming, so we have this mental resistance.In the beginning, when we're super motivated it's much easier to do something. For example; going to the gym for 1 hour doesn't seem that hard, because the initial motivation is a powerful driving force.But when we're motivated it's also easy to impose some super high expectations on ourselves.We think: ""Ok, so I went to the gym for 1 hour the first few days. From now on I'll to go to the gym for 1 full hour every single day.""But once that initial motivation fades away after a few days, there is now nothing that's driving us forward, and we haven't really formed a habit yet.That's why when we're unmotivated, we'll probably just skip gym altogether, as dedicating a whole hour to it seems daunting.So instead of relying on motivation to push us forward, we should focus on making our new habit, an actual habit.Let me explain what I mean, by introducing you to the 2 minute rule.",PT9M4S,1/21/19,1/21/19,11332,Better Than Yesterday,/channel/UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,19,-3QJke9_Z4o,0,

No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.I was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording.

But what they share is a tendency to repeat big, obvious lies -- a tactic researchers have dubbed the “firehose of falsehood.” Whether it’s lying about Russian troops in Crimea or falsely claiming millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 election, both leaders demonstrate a kind of shamelessness when it comes to telling and retelling big lies.

Fox News keeps forcing Trump into shutdowns,News & Politics,1158333,"26,373","6,258","Government shutdowns are disasters for Republicans, but right-wing media makes it almost impossible for the GOP to compromise in a budget fight.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOThe U.S. government has experienced three major shutdowns over the past twenty-five years. In 1995, it was a fight over programs like Medicare. In 2013, it was over an effort to defund Obamacare. In 2018, it was over funding for a border wall. And while each crisis revolved around a different policy fight, they all followed a similar pattern: Republicans, egged on by right-wing pundits and talk radio, were pressured into forcing a government shutdown that eventually blew up in their faces. Ever since the 90s, Republicans have become dependent on right-wing outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh to rally and mobilize their supporters. That’s garnered them success in major elections, but it’s also backed them into a corner. Republicans know they can’t betray the conservative pundits who helped elect them, but those pundits are becoming more and more ideologically extreme, pressuring Republicans to shut the government down over even minor funding disputes. As long as right-wing media has a stranglehold on conservative politics, Republicans will keep finding themselves steered into crises they know they can’t win.

Parallel Worlds Probably Exist.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'Code for solving the Schrödinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Quantum...I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches.

How to Slow Aging (and even reverse it),Education,1742049,"96,423","1,135","Scientists like Prof Sinclair have evidence of speeding up, slowing, and even reversing aging. Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLPWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.Special thanks to:Professor David Sinclair, check out his book ""Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To""Assistant Professor David GoldNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)Genepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortalEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tvAnimation: Etsuko UnoArt and Technical Direction: Drew BerrySound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma BortignonScientific Consultation: Marnie BlewittCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical ResearchFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek MullerMusic from https://epidemicsound.com ""Clearer Views"" ""Innovations"" ""A Sound Foundation"" ""Seaweed""Additional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.com ""Marty Gots a Plan""",PT21M10S,12/14/19,12/14/19,133,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,QRt7LjqJ45k,0,

Is America Actually Metric?,Education,2362874,"55,877","1,235","The US signed the metre convention and bases all customary units on SI standards. As an aside, the Utah constitution from 1895 required the metric system to be taught in schools. This requirement was repealed in 1987. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Huge thanks to NIST, Ben Stein and Patrick Abbott.https://www.nist.gov/https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-...Special thanks to Patreon Supporters:Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan HansenBack in 1875 The US signed the Metre Convention, which basically committed the country to use the metric system. In return, French scientists sent two platinum-iridium cylinders that weigh 1kg to the US in 1889 (known by their designations K4 and K20 from a set of 40 identical objects that were produced and sent around the world). So even though everything you see and buy in the US is usually reported in pounds, all weights are traceable back to the K20 kilogram (by applying a conversion factor to get to pounds).When I was in DC a few weeks ago, I visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and got up close with K20, which is still kept there and used to calibrate all mass standards in this country. I thought it was pretty cool.Edited by Bill Connor",PT8M52S,5/10/17,5/10/17,131123,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,SmSJXC6_qQ8,0,

These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic.

There are literally 1000's of success books out there, so why should this one be any different? Stephen Covey researched the last 200 years of success literature and found something interesting.. In the last 50 years, most of the books have been focused on the personality ethic - Things like public image, how you dress, how you perform in social interactions, positive mental attitude, skills and techniques to get people to behave in certain ways. These books focus on how to appear rather than how to actually be. The 7 habits of highly effective people takes an inside out approach – it focuses on the character ethic rather than the personality ethic.1 - be proactive2 - begin with the end in mind3 - put first things first4 - think win win 5 - seek first to understand then to be understood6 - synergy7 - sharpen the sawWisdom for life Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/Wisdom-For-L...Check out my blog: https://russjamieson.comHaving issues with shyness and social anxiety?https://socialanxietymentor.com/",PT13M19S,1/7/18,1/7/18,113323,WISDOM FOR LIFE,/channel/UCTQgz1HeKoCMayrsyOJTdQw,UCTQgz1HeKoCMayrsyOJTdQw,19,WFc08j9eorQ,0,

Visiting North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4464271,"21,717","2,397","Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

The MOST EVIL KIDS in the History of the Mankind,Education,4405483,"72,334","2,663","WHO ARE THE MOST EVIL KIDS?You’ve probably heard the saying, “Kids can be so cruel,” which is usually in reference to schoolyard bullying. It might also relate to such things as young kids pulling the legs off spiders. Psychologists tell us one of the reasons for such cruelty, especially against animals, is that children have not fully developed their sense of empathy. Sometimes they just don’t understand the gravity of their actions. But then older kids should know better. Psychologists also tell us older kids that tend to be evil might have suffered from abusive relationships. They might also just be little psychopaths in the making, domineering devils with an anti-social attitude, and sometimes it seems there’s no rational explanation why they are they way they are.

My Video Went Viral. Here's Why,Education,2789737,"202,797","3,836","My hypothesis is that the algorithm, rather than viewer preference, drives views on the site. As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",PT23M43S,5/19/19,5/19/19,1311,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,fHsa9DqmId8,0,

Real Life Bubble Boy - Boy Who Was Quarantined for Life,Education,1429174,"28,717",731,"Being isolated at home can be rough on a person, and now many of you viewers know that from firsthand experience. But imagine if you had to spend your entire life in quarantine? Imagine if every day invisible pathogens threatened to take your life away...pathogens that were harmless to other people because they were naturally protected against them. You are a special case indeed, and there will be no contact or cuddles with other people for as long as you live. You’ll never feel the touch of another person’s skin...not even your own mother’s. The very planet is your predator, the air is pervasive with invisible threats that lay in wait to finish you off.

World's Roundest Object!,Education,30224218,"311,483","11,458","The world's roundest object helps solve the longest running problem in measurement -- how to define the kilogram.Support Veritasium on Patreon: http://bit.ly/VePatreonA kilogram isn't what it used to be. Literally. The original name for it was the 'grave', proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.But the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn't seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.The Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro's constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro's constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro's constant.Special thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help. Thanks also to Nessy Hill for filming and reviewing earlier drafts of this video.There is debate as to whether this is truly the roundest object ever created. The Gravity Probe-B rotors are also spherical with very low tolerances such that they may in fact be rounder.Music by Kevin McLeod (incompetech.com) Decision, Danse Macabre, Scissors",PT11M44S,3/25/13,3/25/13,131113,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,ZMByI4s-D-Y,0,

Disturbing Wikipedia Pages,Education,3853080,"67,948","3,655","Whatever you need a website for, create yours today with Wix: https://www.wix.com/go/infographics What are some of the most disturbing wikipedia pages? As you probably know, a wiki is a website which consists of collaborations of people modifying content. The most popular of these sites is none other than Wikipedia. It was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. The former once said, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.” And they did a good job. You can find 301 languages on Wikipedia, but the English language version is easily the biggest. Right now, in English you can find 5.7 million articles, and 46 million pages, which have been edited 860 million times and looked at by 1,203 admins. It’s not surprising then, that there’s some weird stuff you can find on Wikipedia. And that’s what we’ll look at today, in this episode of the Infographics Show, the Scariest Wikipedia articles.SUBSCRIBE TO US -► http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SOCIAL:Twitter........► https://twitter.com/TheInfoShowSubreddit...► http://reddit.com/r/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources for this episode:https://pastebin.com/h5BkqGpx",PT12M4S,11/30/18,11/30/18,12213,The Infographics Show,/channel/UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,19,6Qq3fHDw48w,0,

Why every social media site is a dumpster fire,News & Politics,1247204,"38,469","3,917","Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube exploit our tribalism to keep us watching ads. That makes them a perfect target for trolls, conspiracy theorists, and con artists. Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSocial media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are built to cater to the base preferences and desires of their users -- figuring out what information people enjoy with and then showing them more of it. That’s a great way to keep people online, but it also makes these platforms prime target for con artists. People are naturally drawn to inflammatory and sensational news stories, regardless of whether or not they're true. So bad actors -- conspiracy theorists, trolls, and fake news writers -- have been tremendously successful in using these platforms to spread false and divisive content that exploit people’s tribal instincts. In 2016, it was Macedonian teens making thousands of dollars publishing inflammatory fake stories about Hillary Clinton. After the Parkland shooting, it was random YouTubers going viral by accusing students of being crisis actors. Even the Russian trolls who meddled in the presidential election did so by posting low-quality, highly emotional content to social media -- content they knew would go viral.The problem with these social media sites isn’t that a few bad apples are ruining the fun. It’s that they’re designed to reward bad apples. And as long as con artists can use these platforms to prey on people’s most base desires, social media sites will continue reflecting the worst of human nature back at us.Read more of Jay Van Bevel’s work here: https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-public...

Does Planet 9 Exist?,Education,3036528,"79,475","2,132","A planet has been predicted to orbit the sun with a period of 10,000 years, a mass 5x that of Earth on a highly elliptical and inclined orbit. What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?Huge thanks to:Prof. Konstantin Batygin, CaltechProf. David Jewitt, UCLAI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.Special Thanks to Patreon Supporters:Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige ThormanMusic from http://epidemicsound.com ""Observations - From Now On"" ""Magnified XY""",PT16M20S,9/13/19,9/13/19,131323,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,20,pe83T9hISoY,0,

How Was Video Invented?,Education,1693068,"55,838",708,"I always wanted to know why film looked better than video.

I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.Additional resources and references:The Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Mediumhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftapeWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

How I Tricked My Brain To Like Doing Hard Things (dopamine detox),Education,5184415,"451,327","4,819","Support Better Than Yesterday:https://www.buymeacoffee.com/uQKkXCF6BYou probably don't have a problem playing video games or browsing social media on your phone. In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",PT14M14S,2/24/20,2/24/20,111233,Better Than Yesterday,/channel/UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,19,9QiE-M1LrZk,0,
