Sapolsky states that our bodies' stress response evolved to help us get out of short-term physical emergencies - if a lion is chasing you, you run. But such reactions, he points out, compromise long-term physical health in favor of immediate self-preservation. Unfortunately, when confronted with purely psychological stressors, such as troubleshooting the fax machine, modern humans turn on the same stress response. ""If you turn it on for too long,"" notes Sapolsky, ""you get sick."" Sapolsky regards this sobering news with characteristic good humor, finding hope in ""our own capacity to prevent some of these problems... in the small steps with which we live our everyday lives.""This lecture was recorded on September 22, 2016 at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts' Colwell Playhouse as part of the Pygmalion TechFest",PT87M44S,6/20/17,6/20/17,133223,BeckmanInstitute,/channel/UC8xgCLm7njxSsJfijJWg53w,UC8xgCLm7njxSsJfijJWg53w,20,D9H9qTdserM,,

I’m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I’m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, “What has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?”  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.

Really, Japan is a unique country, different from the rest of the world. Japanese farmers grow square watermelons, people park and lock their umbrella before going inside a building and there’s a whole chain of restaurants all over the country where they serve only canned food.

Mostly because they save time for people who work late hours, which is a pretty common thing there.- In 2015, Godzilla was granted citizenship in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward. - Punctuality is a really big thing there, and train stations do everything possible to avoid a delay.-  While in many other countries slurping is considered rude, in Japan it’s a way to show your appreciation of the dish.- Japanese people don't eat mayo with salads, meat, and sandwiches; in Japan, people usually use it as a topping for ice-cream or on pancakes. - World’s shortest escalator is in the basement of More’s Department Store, which is located in the city of Kawasaki. The escalator has only 5 steps and is only 33 inches tall. - The village of Nagoro used to have a population of 300 people, but less than 40 residents live there now. A local artist, Tsukimi Ayano, made over 300 life-size dolls, most of which look like former residents; and they’re located in various states of action. - It’s common for Japanese culture to avoid the number 4 because it’s considered to be very unlucky. - They use a blue color instead of green for traffic lights. The reason for that hides in their language: historically, there was only one word for both colors.- Japanese kids learn how to clean in many schools because it’s a part of their education. - Toilets in Japan are very high-tech. To use one, a person should know what all those buttons are for.-  Since Japan is a densely-populated country, they don’t like to waste space. That’s why their parking lots have a smart system. They’re designed like multi-level garages.Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",PT10M41S,9/28/19,9/28/19,313332,BRIGHT SIDE,/channel/UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,19,s1m_yhi9oqA,,
"Amazing Bhutan: Free Healthcare, No Homeless People, No Traffic Lights",Travel & Events,6254458,"162,360","3,802","This mysterious and picturesque country located between India and China was closed for tourists until 1974. Today, everyone who’s ready to go through a lot of formalities and has enough money can visit Bhutan. Ans even though the borders are open, the King still tries to restrict the number of tourists using many different methods.This is a country that decided to measure national happiness, has completely free healthcare, and nobody living on the streets. Sounds unbelievable, but this is all true about Bhutan, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. So, wanna know why all the people who live in Bhutan are so happy? Let's find out more about their traditions and numerous bans.Other videos you might like:What Every Country In the World Is Best At? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkLsA...32 Creative World Flags Made by True Geniuses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Cd9...16 Crazy Things That Are Considered Normal In Other Countries https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7vz0...TIMESTAMPS:No homeless people at all 0:31Free healthcare 0:48Unplugged 1:10National Dress Code 1:44No Smoking! 2:14Ecology is everything 2:48They like it hot! 3:31Touring obstacles 4:07Ladies first 5:00100% Organic? 5:19They keep food on the roof 6:12Only the best pilots are allowed to fly to Bhutan 6:11Wedding rules 7:00The Ministry of Happiness 7:47The road less traveled 8:42Gingerbread-like houses 9:08#Bhutan #traveling #brightsidePreview photo credit: King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema, BHUTAN: By NIV/SIPA/EAST NEWS, https://www.eastnews.ru/pictures/pict...Animation is created by Bright Side.Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- If a person loses their home, they just need to go to the king and he’ll give them a plot of land where they can build a house to live in and plant a garden to eat from.- Each Bhutanese resident has the right to free medical care. The country’s Ministry of Health has made it their goal to become “A nation with the best health.”- The Bhutanese people take their traditions and unique culture very seriously, and the king took great measures to protect his people from outside influences.- Speaking of traditions, Bhutanese people are required to wear traditional clothes in public. This nationwide dress code has existed for over 400 years.- In 2010, the king enacted a law prohibiting the cultivation, harvest, and sale of tobacco, making Bhutan the first country in the world with a total ban on tobacco. It’s impossible to buy it there, and you can’t smoke in public areas. - Bhutan is really concerned about ecology and nature. According to a local law, at least 60% of the country’s total area must be covered with woods.- The most popular ingredient in almost every Bhutanese dish is chilies. The Tourism Council even notes “Bhutanese people would not enjoy a meal that was not spicy.”- You can only go to Bhutan in groups of 3 or more. All documents and visas are issued by a state-appointed company. - All property and belongings like their homes, cattle, and land go to the eldest daughter, not son. Men are expected to earn their own fortunes.- It’s already illegal to import or use any chemical products there whatsoever. Everything they use is cultivated within the country and is all-natural. - Not every pilot can maneuver between mountaintops and land on a 6,500-foot-long highway right by people’s houses. Add strong winds to the challenge, and you’ll understand why take-offs and landings are only allowed during daylight hours. And there are only 8 pilots in the world that can do this. - If you visit Bhutan, you may fall in love with the land, but try not to fall for a local or else you’ll get your heart broken. It’s prohibited to marry foreigners. - In 2008, the Gross National Happiness Committee was formed in Bhutan to take care of the people’s inner peace. - All the road signs in Bhutan are drawn by hand. Thiumphu, the country’s capital, is the only one in the world that has no traffic lights at all. - Bhutanese people love to decorate their homes. They draw birds, animals, and different patterns on the walls, making them look like real-life gingerbread houses.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCStock materials (photos, footages and other):https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",PT10M10S,6/18/19,6/18/19,31333,BRIGHT SIDE,/channel/UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,19,Au3QBbuyc2M,,

In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s.

Water harvesting principles & the story of an African rain farmer Design guidelines for regenerative,Nonprofits & Activism,42835,,,"“You must plant the rain before you plant a seed or tree!” proclaimed rain farmer Mr. Zephaniah Phiri Maseko of Zimbabwe. By doing just that, he and his family turned a wasteland into an oasis, raised groundwater and well levels even in dry years, reduced flooding in wet years, and enhanced the fertility of the soils. This inspiring story will be shared along with the strategies used, and more importantly, the guiding principles that informed the choice, placement, and implementation of these strategies into a more integrated and productive system. These principles work in any climate experiencing a dry season or drought. And they help us see and act more holistically by asking us questions that direct our attention to important aspects of water and fertility systems we might otherwise overlook.Presenter: Brad Lancaster is a dynamic teacher, consultant, and designer of regenerative systems that sustainably enhance local resources and our global potential.

He offers examples of this misstep in areas as divergent as economics, the environment, and national defense.Finally, he warns us to resist the influence of intellectuals and points out that the demand for public intellectuals is largely manufactured by the public intellectuals themselves. - Hoover InstitutionThomas Sowell is an American economist, political writer, and commentator.

"Cost-Effective Approaches to Save the Environment, with Bjorn Lomborg",News & Politics,194849,"4,326",248,"Recorded on February 11, 2019. How much will it cost to slow climate change? Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, performs cost-benefit analysis on the Green New Deal and the UN’s Climate Report, analyzes the economic impact of climate change in the next century, and proposes economically feasible alternative plans to reduce climate change. Is climate change the rapidly impending apocalypse it seems? Bjorn Lomborg discusses climate change as depicted in doomsday films like The Day after Tomorrow and breaks down why it will not be an instantaneous apocalypse as often portrayed. He talks about the economic impact climate change will have on the global GDP in the next one hundred years if not solved and the impact on the global GDP if money is spent towards resolving it. He details the reasons Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal is not feasible in the ten-year timeline she has proposed and why, even if it were feasible, it would be prohibitively expensive. He discusses the reality of reducing the amount of energy used in developing countries and how it’s unlikely that those countries will be willing to give up on things like electricity now that they have it. Lomborg suggests that the best way to resolve climate change is to put money now towards research and development for new, cleaner sources of energy that are cheaper than coal and natural gas, because countries will be much more likely to adopt a new energy resource if it is the cheapest option. Finding cheaper energy solutions will have a positive impact on global GDP, and people will be much more willing to adopt it. He also suggests implementing a modest carbon tax, which would have a great long-term impact on reducing climate change.

Discrimination and Disparities with Thomas Sowell,News & Politics,213136,"5,705",136,"Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of “disparate impact” and how it disregards the American legal principle of “burden of proof.” Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like “disparate impact” fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child’s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

Kotkin describes what motivated Stalin to make the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Hitler and the consequences of his decision. Kotkin dives into the history of the USSR and its relationship with Germany during WWII, analyzing the two leaders' decisions, strategies, and thought processes. He explains Stalin's and Hitler’s motivations to enter into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact even without the support of their respective regimes. Stalin’s goal was to defeat the West and he saw the pact as an opportunity to do so by driving a wedge between Germany and the capitalist West. Kotkin analyzes Stalin’s decisions leading up to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and the disinformation Germany was feeding soviet spies to prevent Stalin from moving against Hitler first.

How to Fail at Almost Everything with Scott Adams,News & Politics,365637,"7,283",407,"Recorded on July 12, 2017The Dilbert comic strip artist and political philosopher Scott Adams sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. He discusses with Peter  his theory of “talent stacking,” the idea that rather than being an expert in one particular skill (i.e.,  Tiger Woods and golf), one can become successful by stacking a variety of complementary nonexpert skills. Adams demonstrates how talent stacking has been beneficial in his life because he has stacked  comic artist skills with his MBA and experience in corporate environments to create a wildly successful comic strip that resulted in spin-off books, a television series, a video game, and merchandise. His business skills gave him the tools to create a business satire comic strip and the skill set to manage the business that evolved from that  strip.  Adams also discusses how he uses his Dilbert blog to discuss his political philosophies and observations about the Trump administration. He wrote blogposts about the 2016 election and predicted that Donald Trump would win based on President Trump’s talent stack as a media mogul and businessman who had spent significant time in the public eye so  was immune to scandals and thick-skinned enough to handle what the media and other politicians would throw at him. Adams argues that President Trump is one of the best branders, influencers, and persuaders  he has ever seen, in that the president uses persuasive techniques in debates and on social media as a way to get people to do what he wants. Adams contends that President Trump’s persuasive techniques will help solve the problem of North Korea because he has already set up China to get involved by intimating that it tried and  failed. Adams believes this will cause China to get involved  to save face. Scott Adams and Peter Robinson finish by chatting about Adams’s views on the story arc of life. Adams says that  he believes he started intentionally selfish so that by the end of his life he can give away all of his wealth, knowledge, and wisdom, a process he says he has already begun. They also briefly discuss his new book, Win Bigly, about the persuasive strategies of Donald Trump. Scott Adams is releasing his new book, Win Bigly, in October 2017.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/how-fa...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Sir Roger Scruton: How to Be a Conservative,News & Politics,626476,"14,209",513,"Recorded on February 27, 2017In the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he’s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain. Sir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn’t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics. Robinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the “indigenous working classes” who made their voices known through their votes. About the Guest: Sir Roger ScrutonSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his “services to philosophy, teaching and public education.”Additional Resources: Brexit:http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-fel...http://www.hoover.org/research/brusse...http://www.hoover.org/research/gibral...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...http://www.hoover.org/research/will-b...

Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality,News & Politics,1129289,"26,930",868,"Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Mathematical Challenges to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution,News & Politics,1329656,"26,257","3,310","Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin’s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin’s theory in their two books and essay, respectively The Deniable Darwin, Darwin’s Doubt, and “Giving Up Darwin” (published in the Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term “species” has not been defined by the authors to Darwin’s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin’s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): “Beauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe—walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track—most of the time.” Gelernter notes that there’s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture—not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin’s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Jason Riley On “False Black Power?”,News & Politics,132439,"2,779",79,"Recorded on February 21, 2019. What is “false black power?” According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Riley’s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the “Great Society” welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist community’s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communities’. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their children’s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

He’s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

Victor Davis Hanson on “The Case For Trump”,News & Politics,2500828,"28,755","2,105","Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump’s “personal authenticity” during the campaign and how the media has a “historical amnesia” of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump’s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn’t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California’s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that’s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

The Vanishing American Adult,News & Politics,564844,"13,440","1,091","Recorded on June 2, 2017Senator Benjamin Sasse joins Peter Robinson to discuss his book The Vanishing American Adult and the growing crisis in America of prolonged adolescence. Senator Sasse argues that children are growing up, entering adolescence, and becoming stuck in the transitional stage to adulthood as they fail to become financially independent from their parents. He argues that because this generation of children is growing up during a time of relative peace and prosperity, it has allowed millennials to grow up without the issues of previous generations that were raised in war time. In this era of consumption and material surplus, he argues that adolescents are leading age-segregated lives and not developing a work ethic and that both their parents have an obligation to teach their children to grow up. Furthermore, he stresses the importance of intergenerational learning by allowing children to be raised around their grandparents and other adults to help them learn that the trivial trials of youth don’t matter in the long run. Senator Sasse believes that there are certain virtues that American children have to learn  to become productive and happy adults. Part of that is by teaching children the distinction between production and consumption and how to find happiness and self-worth through jobs that make one feel like a necessary part of the company/society. This, he argues, will help raise peoples’ self-worth and lead them to happiness and fulfillment in their everyday. Senator Sasse finishes by stressing the importance of building children’s identities as readers to help foster the growth of ideas and active learning over the passive activities of sitting in front of screens. He notes that sedentary life is not fulfilling and that by encouraging people to participate in production over consumption will lead to more fulfilling lives. He ends on the optimistic note, that while our youth may still need guidance, overall America’s best days still lie ahead.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/vanish...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Why Does Joseph Stalin Matter?,News & Politics,625168,"10,654",792,"Recorded on January 25, 2018.“Joseph Stalin, Soviet dictator, creator of great power, and destroyer of tens of millions of lives …” Thus begins this episode of Uncommon Knowledge, which dives into the biography of Joseph Stalin. This episode’s guest, Stephen Kotkin, author of Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941(https://www.amazon.com/Stalin-Waiting...), examines the political career of Joseph Stalin in the years leading up to World War II, his domination over the Soviet Union, and the terror he inspired by the Great Purge from 1936–38. “Why does Joseph Stalin matter?” is a key question for Kotkin, as he explains the history of the Soviet Union and Stalin's enduring impact on his country and the world. Kotkin argues that Stalin is the “gold standard for dictatorships” in regard to the amount of power he managed to obtain and wield throughout his lifetime. Stalin stands out because not only was he able to build a massive amount of military power, he managed to stay in power for three decades, much longer than any comparable dictator. Kotkin and Robinson discuss collectivization and communism and how Stalin’s regime believed it had to eradicate capitalism within the USSR even in regions where capitalism was bringing economic success to the peasants, with the potential of destabilizing the regime. This led to the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression that resulted in the exile and execution of millions of people.

Today’s case—U.S. Patent and Trademark Office v. Booking.com—could upend how trademarks work in the internet age. The U.S. patent office has refused to let Booking.com trademark its company name, arguing that brands can't protect a generic term like 'hotels' by combining it with a generic internet domain like '.com.' Booking.com argues that consumers aren't confused and know it's a specific brand.

'Never has anyone more unqualified been formally nominated by a President to lead the U.S. Intelligence Community,' said Larry Pfeiffer, former CIA chief of staff.

Greening the Desert II,Nonprofits & Activism,80130,"1,346",46,"This half hour video documents the ongoing work of Permaculture Gurus, Geoff and Nadia Lawton, in the Dead Sea Valley. It begins with the famous original 'Greening the Desert' five minute video clip, and then continues into Part II, a 2009 update to the 2001 original. You'll get to see and learn about the original Greening the Desert site and see some of the spin-off effects of its influence throughout Jordan.When there’s no soil, no water, no shade, and where the sun beats down on you to the tune of over 50°C (122°F), the word ‘poverty’ begins to take on a whole new meaning. It is distinct and surreal. It’s a land of dust, flies, intense heat and almost complete dependency on supply lines outside of ones control. This is the remains of what was once called the ‘fertile crescent’. It is the result of thousands of years of abuse. It is a glimpse at a world where the environment – whose services provide for all human need – has all but completely abandoned us. This is a glimpse at the world our consumer society is inexorably moving towards, as our exponential-growth culture gorges itself at ever-increasing rates.The original Greening the Desert video clip has been watched hundreds of thousands of times and has been posted to countless blogs and web pages in the datasphere. Although only five minutes long, it has inspired people around the globe, daring the lucid ones amongst us, those who can see the writing on the wall, to begin to hope and believe in an abundant future – a future where our survival doesn’t have to be based on undermining and depleting the very resources of soil, water, phosphorus, etc. that we depend on. The work profiled in that clip demonstrates that humanity can be a positive element within the biosphere. Man doesn’t have to destroy. Man can repair.For more information visit: http://permaculturenews.org/2009/12/1...",PT36M34S,3/25/15,3/25/15,313113,Permaculturenews,/channel/UCuMqPxtWBj86FREJCHB75_A,UCuMqPxtWBj86FREJCHB75_A,20,9VGHoxpYlWQ,1,0

And they are vibrantly alive, teeming with 10,000 pounds of biological life in every acre. Yet in the last 150 years, we’ve lost half of the basic building block that makes soil productive. The societal and environmental costs of soil loss and degradation in the United States alone are now estimated to be as high as $85 billion every single year.

Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed,News & Politics,101433,"1,888",75,"In Please Stop Helping Us, Jason Riley examines how well-intentioned welfare programs are in fact holding black Americans back. Minimum-wage laws may lift earnings for people who are already employed, but they price a disproportionate number of blacks out of the labor force. Affirmative action in higher education is intended to address past discrimination, but the result is fewer black college graduates than would otherwise exist. And so it goes with everything from soft-on-crime laws, which make black neighborhoods more dangerous, to policies that limit school choice out of a mistaken belief that charter schools and voucher programs harm the traditional public schools that most low-income students attend.",PT60M56S,6/23/14,6/23/14,232323,The Heritage Foundation,/channel/UC5bEfSFTYQVfLCwkhBt8NtQ,UC5bEfSFTYQVfLCwkhBt8NtQ,20,c9wWF1_YFBA,,

These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.The group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications.

Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,News & Politics,2389017,"78,790","44,405","Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann’s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

Turkey made the move shortly after the US announced it would remove some of its troops from the region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had his eyes on the region for years. Turkey, he argued, needed a “safe zone” to serve as a buffer against the Syrian War happening just across the border. Yet back home in Turkey, there were other factors at play that accelerated his calls for an invasion that involved Erdoğan’s own political survival.The move has recalibrated alliances in the Syrian War and added new uncertainty on the future of the region.

Check them out here:  https://99percentinvisible.org/Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOSome cities in Europe are undergoing a fascinating transformation: they’re getting rid of all of their road signs.  That’s thanks to a design concept called “shared space,” where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.  There’s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection, in theory leading to safer travel.

Why the US and Iran are fighting over this tiny waterway,News & Politics,2129086,"45,912","1,970","The Strait of Hormuz, “the jugular of the global economy,"" has become a useful bargaining chip for Iran.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labThe Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that lies between Iran and Oman. This 21 mile-wide passage supports 20% of the world’s oil supply. A closure of this waterway could send the global economy into a tailspin. In recent months, several oil tankers have been seized, attacked and harassed. These oil tankers — and this narrow water passage — are at the center of the conflict between the US and Iran.

How can citizens regain control of their data?It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the ""residual data"" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user.

Charlie Munger's advice on investing and life choices that make a person wealthy,News & Politics,713779,"10,175",371,"As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers."" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.ANDY SERWER: Right.CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word ""common sense,"" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.For more of this transcript click;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/influe...Subscribe to Yahoo Finance: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbAbout Yahoo Finance: At Yahoo Finance, you get free stock quotes, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, international market data, social interaction and mortgage rates that help you manage your financial life.Connect with Yahoo Finance:Get the latest news: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbFind Yahoo Finance on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2A9u5ZqFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2LMgloPFollow Yahoo Finance on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LOpNYz",PT41M42S,5/9/19,5/9/19,112121,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,RFxXl9eAWV4,,

States including New York and New Jersey, where stay-in-place orders are still in effect, cases fell on a day-over-day basis yet again. In California, the latest daily death toll was 39 on Monday, the lowest in three weeks. California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state’s lockdown restrictions will begin loosening on Friday.However, other states that have already begun to ease stay-in-place measures, including Georgia, recorded daily increases in new deaths, spooking investors over the viability of near-term opening plans and sending stocks lower during Monday’s session before recovering.Monday also brought with it more signs of distress from some of the industries most exposed to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures aimed at containing it.After market close, L Brands (LB) said it and private equity firm Sycamore Partners struck a deal to terminate a previously announced deal to have the latter take a majority state in Victoria’s Secret and take it private. And earlier, J.Crew’s parent company Chinos Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, converting nearly $2 billion in debt to equity and transferring ownership as the beleaguered retailer struggled to maintain sales as hundreds of physical locations shuttered during the outbreak.The bankruptcy – the first by a major retailer amid the pandemic – is almost certainly not the last, with Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney reportedly also discussing the possibility of bankruptcy financing with lenders. Retail sales for the clothing and accessory stores category as a whole were down more than 50% in March, the Commerce Department previously reported.Meanwhile, shares of each of the four major U.S. airlines Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) rose in early trading after ending the Monday’s session lower, after Warren Buffett announced Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire about 10% previous stake in each of these carriers.—8:32 a.m. ET: U.S. trade deficit widens to $44.4 billion in March as exports drop by record amountThe U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened to $44.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. This was greater than the deficit of $44.2 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data, and February’s $39.8 billion deficit.The yawning deficit was driven by a record 9.6% drop in March exports to $187.75 billion, from $207.75 billion in February. This more than offset a 6.2% decline in March imports to $232.16 billion, or the greatest drop in 11 years.—7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday: Stock futures extend gainsHere were the main moves in markets, as of 7:09 a.m. ET Tuesday:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 25.75 points, or 0.91%, to 2,851.00Dow futures (YM=F): up 229 points, or 0.97%, to 23,800.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 87.25 points, or 0.99%, to 8,882.75Crude (CL=F): +$1.99 (+9.76%) to $22.38 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$8.50 (-0.50%) to $1,704.80 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.5 bps to yield 0.662%—6:04 p.m. ET Monday: Stock futures open slightly higherHere were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:04 p.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,830.25Dow futures (YM=F): up 55 points, or 0.23%, to 23,626.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 8,813.50",PT0M0S,5/4/20,5/4/20,11231,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,d8Lk0b8-P3g,,
