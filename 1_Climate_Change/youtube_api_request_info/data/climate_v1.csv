The film tacks together two tales: a historical account of Tesla's eventful life and his pioneering research into physics and bold experiments with electricity.
Suffering from a fatal malady as a child the future great physicist promised his parents that he would recover under the sole condition...if they allowed him to become an engineer. And he kept his promise. Never ending yearning for knowledge, research practice, creative endeavor, discoveries that have unfixed all established notions -- that's what was the characteristic of the great physicist. Nikola Tesla would always remain a scientist whose life was a sort of mystification rather than pure reality.",2014-02-04T15:13:49.000Z,UCa4grme_V_sz4c2P5B-hAIw,FILM.UA Group,1913732,41081,869,0,3011,Film & Animation,1,0

Solfeggio frequencies form part of an ancient scale that was rediscovered by Dr. Joseph Puleo in 1974. They are a 6 tone sequence of special electromagnetic frequencies. They were originally used in Gregorian chants many hundreds of years ago, and recently, they were brought back to everybodyâ€™s attention for their healing powers.

These frequencies induce movements of consciousness that will help stimulate new changes that are necessary for individuals who would like to achieve awakening. 

it has been said that these frequencies have helped many individuals throughout the centuries to undo difficult situations, to change their perspective of things, to turn sadness into happiness, but above all, it has also helped many to reconnect with their own true selves.

The frequencies are the following:

â˜… 396 Hertz: DO. It is usually related to guilt and fear, and how they can suppress other emotions as well. It is associated with the color red.

â˜… 417 Hertz: RE. It is usually related to past trauma and negativity and the willingness to change. This frequency can help you to recognize those past traumas that are no longer valuable in your life. It is associated with the color orange.

â˜… 528 Hertz: MI. It is usually related to DNA, peace of mind and clarity. This frequency will help you heal and remove any sickness you may have. It is associated with the color yellow.

â˜… 639 Hertz: FA. It is usually related to Interpersonal relationships. This frequency will help you heal those difficult relationships you still have from the past while also reconnecting with those who are valuable in your present. It is associated with the color green.

â˜… 741 Hertz: SOL. It is usually related to the emotional stability you are looking for. This frequency will help you solve any problems you may have in your life. It is associated with the color blue.

â˜… 852 Hertz: LA. It is usually related to the views of oneself and the universe. It requires open space in order to allow intuition to come in. It is associated with the color indigo.

â˜… 963 Hertz: SI. it is usually related to the feeling of oneness. It means awakening and interconnected to the universe. This frequency helps you to reconnect with yourself. It is associated with the color purple.

And this isnâ€™t something new either, as ancient civilizations from all areas of the world seemed to use music as therapy, in all of its forms. The greeks used flutes or lyres, the Mesopotamians used the harp, or the Incas used the flutes (or quena as they are traditionally known).  

Choose a Solfeggio frequency track: Perhaps you would like to start at the beginning? It doesnâ€™t matter, as there isnâ€™t a specific order for them to be playedâ€¦in fact, you can choose to do one if you would like to focus on that specific frequency for the time being. 

Many experience a shift happening after the first couple of seconds of listening. Be consistent with it to truly raise your vibration to cleanse out old unconscious energy that holds one locked in a fear-based reality.

Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Tesla held over 300 patents and is responsible for inventing the laser, x-ray, radio, Tesla coil, Tesla turbine, neon signs, induction motor, remote control and many more. Tesla was a brilliant mind, but did not focus his energy on monetizing his inventions and had difficulty socializing. He died alone in a small hotel in New York. 
The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day El Giza, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Correction: In the video I draw a line pointing to the middle pyramid as The Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid is actually the northern most pyramid of the 3.

The earth has gone through countless changes in its history. Antarctica at one time was not covered with ice, and could have been home to ancient humans. As we develop new methods for uncovering the ice, we are beginning to see the possibilities that lay below. Mainstream ideology puts forward the ""Out of Africa"" theory, which tracks humans originating in Africa and spreading out by land across the world. However, genetic research is finding evidence that makes our story far more complex. One of these findings is the discovery of the Denisovan people of Siberia, which reveals an entirely new, intelligent human subspecies (first discovered in 2008). It is findings like this, that cause us to have to rewrite human history.

13,22,eOUWgtbIhgE,PT9M10S,TRUE,hd,The War on Consciousness - Graham Hancock,"What is death? Our materialist science reduces everything to matter, materialist science in the West says that we are just meat, weâ€™re just our bodies. So when the brain is dead, thatâ€™s the end of consciousness, there is no life after death, there is no soul; we just rot and are gone. Actually, many honest scientists should admit that consciousness is the greatest mystery of science and that we donâ€™t know exactly how it works. The brain is involved in it some way but weâ€™re not sure how. It could be that the brain generates consciousness the way a generator makes electricity, if you hold to that paradigm, then of course you canâ€™t believe in life after death, when the generatorâ€™s broken, consciousness is gone. But itâ€™s equally possible that the relationship â€” and nothing in neuroscience rules it out â€“ that the relationship is more like the relationship of the TV signal to the TV set, and in that case, when the TV set is broken, of course the TV signal continues. And this is the paradigm of all spiritual traditions, that we are immortal souls temporarily incarnated in these physical forms.

If we want to understand consciousness, the last people we should ask are materialist scientists. Instead, we should look at ancient cultures, like the Egyptians, who highly valued dream states. Many ancient cultures around the world used hallucinogenic plants to understand consciousness and expand their minds. 

However in today's society, visionary plants are highly illegal because they promote a state of consciousness that does not agree with the agenda of profit. Substances, like coffee, alcohol, sugar and pharmaceuticals, are forced upon the population, but possession of even small quantities of cannabis, Ayahuasca or psilocybin will land you in jail. If we do not recognize the right of adult sovereignty over consciousness, then we can NOT claim to be free. 

Look at what our moderns state of consciousness has done. We have destroyed the natural gifts of earth in pursuit of short-term, selfish gain. We must reconnect with spirit immediately or else we will encounter disaster. Visionary plants could be the remedy for our current sickness. 

Disclaimer: We are not promoting risky, illegal or dangerous behavior. Do your research before taking any action. Visionary plants are not meant for partying. They should be used responsibly, in moderation and under experienced supervision.

En dehors de Wall Street, qui connaÃ®t BlackRock, le plus puissant gestionnaire dâ€™actifs de la planÃ¨teÂ ? EnquÃªte sur un acteur discret mais influent de la vie Ã©conomique et politique mondiale.

Si lâ€™argent ne fait pas le bonheur, il ouvre sans nul doute les portes du pouvoir. Une maxime que le groupe de gestion d'actifs BlackRock, avec sesÂ 6Â 000Â milliards de dollars amÃ©ricains passÃ©s, soit plus de deux fois le PIB de la France, connaÃ®t bien. SociÃ©tÃ©s, gouvernements et banques centrales : l'entreprise tentaculaire ne cesse d'Ã©tendre son influence dans toutes les directions, depuis sa crÃ©ation, enÂ 1988, par Larry Fink. La force de ce gÃ©ant amÃ©ricain de la gestion rÃ©side dans les milliards de dollars que lui confient ses clients, pour la plupart des gros poissons de la finance : multinationales, institutions financiÃ¨res et fonds dâ€™investissementÂ ou de pension. GrÃ¢ce Ã  cette manne financiÃ¨re, le groupe a mis le grappin sur de nombreuses multinationales. Actuellement, BlackRock est entre autres prÃ©sent dans le capital dâ€™Apple, de Microsoft, de Facebook, de McDonaldâ€™s, de Siemens, ainsi que de nombreuses entreprises du CACÂ 40. Non content dâ€™investir dans les entreprises les mieux cotÃ©es du monde, le gestionnaire d'actifs est aussi dans les petits papiers de gouverneurs de banques centrales, de ministres des finances et mÃªme de chefs dâ€™Ã‰tat, Ã  qui il prodigue de prÃ©cieux conseils. Et pour causeÂ : il dispose non seulement des meilleurs experts financiers, mais aussi dâ€™un algorithme de prÃ©vision conjoncturel sans Ã©gal, Aladdin. Lors de la crise financiÃ¨re deÂ 2008, de nombreux gouvernements proches du naufrage avaient fait appel au groupe de Larry Fink, ce qui lui a permis de renforcer son emprise sur lâ€™Ã©conomie mondiale et de prÃ©senter Ã  tous le visage d'une entreprise providentielleâ€¦Â

""This is why their film has come as a shock to so many,"" Mr Bolt said.

""Green groups are actually trying to get 'Planet of the Humans' banned.

""Isn't that a sign of the times? If you don't like the message, just try and ban it.""

20,25,kFQJNeQDDHA,PT50M30S,TRUE,hd,The Wall Street Code | VPRO documentary | 2013,"A thriller about a genius algorithm builder who dared to stand up against Wall Street. Haim Bodek, aka The Algo Arms Dealer. After Quants: the Alchemists of Wall Street and Money & Speed: Inside the Black Box. This is the final episode of a trilogy in search of the winners and losers of the tech revolution on Wall Street. Trading on the financial market is not longer dominated by humans, but by super fast computers and algorithms. The result of this digital revolution on Wall Street is a complex and fragmented financial system that is hard to understand and overseen. A system that we are all connected to. The only people who understand the system a bit, are the people who built it.

Haim Bodek started his own high frequency trading in 2007 and built a from his point of view perfect and fast algorithm. One day it just stopped working. Profits disappeared en he went looking for the cause. He decided to go public with his search to display the rotten system.

21,25,WBFoV6jn79c,PT46M39S,TRUE,hd,Being offline is the new luxury - VPRO documentary,"When have you been offline for the last time? Did you choose yourself to be offline or was internet not working? To be offline seems more and more to become a choice that we see as a luxury. Is being offline the new luxury or is it still a luxury to be online for some people?

Digital networks are becoming denser and denser. We are online all the time everywhere and they are fewer places where we really can be alone. Where and when can we still disconnect? To be offline has become a luxury. Will we permanently use data or do we take back control over our connectivity? In this documentary we go on a journey to the edge of internet. 

To be online all the time and everywhere. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. As digital networks are closing in, there are fewer places to be really on your own. Being offline is becoming a luxury. Where can you be offline? 

We are connected to the internet even in our bedrooms. Itâ€™s the ambition of companies like Google and Facebook to connect the entire world, so that we can be online all the time and everywhere. Google has sent balloons up into the skies over Sri Lanka to provide the island state with free Wi-Fi for a month. On the ground, more and more devices communicate through the so-called Internet-of-Things. We are going to be â€˜glass citizensâ€™ in a transparent house, connected for life to a wireless intravenous drip and traced anywhere via our smartphones. What does it mean? 

A small but growing group of people is saying goodbye to lifetime connectability. They are researching ways to keep control. What can we learn from them about life in the digital era? With: Paul Frissen (political scientist), Sherry Turkle (psychologist MIT), Evgeny Morozov (internet critic) and Birgitta Jonsdottir (hacker & founder Pirate Party)

22,25,hIXhnWUmMvw,PT50M,TRUE,hd,Shoshana Zuboff on surveillance capitalism | VPRO Documentary,"Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff wrote a monumental book about the new economic order that is alarming. ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,"" reveals how the biggest tech companies deal with our data. How do we regain control of our data? What is surveillance capitalism?

In this documentary, Zuboff takes the lid off Google and Facebook and reveals a merciless form of capitalism in which no natural resources, but the citizen itself, serves as a raw material. How can citizens regain control of their data?

It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the ""residual data"" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.

This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user. Internet advertisements can, therefore, be used in a very targeted and effective way. A completely new business model is born: ""surveillance capitalism.""

Below is a further discussion by Henry Reich that I think helps summarize why axes 1 and 3 are generally stable while axis 2 is not:

In general, you might imagine that because the object can rotate in a bunch of different directions, the components of energy and momentum could be free to change while keeping the total momentum constant.

However, in the case of axis 1, the kinetic energy is the highest possible for a given angular momentum, and in the case of axis 3, the kinetic energy is the lowest possible for a given angular momentum (which can be easily shown from conservation of energy and momentum equations, and is also fairly intuitive from the fact that kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared, while momentum is proportional to velocity - so in the case of axis 1, the smaller masses will have to be spinning faster for a given momentum, and will thus have more energy, and vice versa for axis 3 where all the masses are spinning: the energy will be lowest). In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.

Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",2019-09-19T15:50:15.000Z,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,Veritasium,4623444,164989,2597,0,12251,Education,0,0

On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.

â€œScience doesnâ€™t proceed or get better with established ideas. You have to challengeâ€<9d>

Recently a team of fossil hunters working in Kenya came upon a set of fossilised teeth and a series of bones. Their find set in motion a chain of events that ignited excitement across the scientific world, for if they were correct in their findings, not only would they have found the oldest human ancestor, but much of the received wisdom humankindâ€™s evolution would have to be rewritten. This programme is the story of their discovery and the implications it has for understanding of how we split from the apes. Dubbed â€œMillennium Manâ€<9d> by the press, he is twice as old as the most famous skeleton in the world â€œLucyâ€<9d>. The remarkable link between Millennium Man and humans is his ability to walk on two legs, overturning previously accepted scientific opinion on why, how and when humans began to walk. As Professor Senut who worked on the project points out, â€œScience doesnâ€™t proceed or get better with established ideas. You have to challengeâ€<9d> and Millennium Man seems to be challenging an awful lot of accepted science. Documentary first broadcast in 2001.

44,28,I1IDC8FEIBU,PT10M28S,FALSE,sd,How tesla electricity can create wireless power | The Economist,"Nikola Tesla built a tower to broadcast electric power. It failed. Soon, sending power through the air might be the norm

Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2Vj

The inventor, Nikola Tesla, dreamt of wireless power. Among his work in the realm of electricity he built a coil, later named the Tesla coil, which could illuminate lamps from across a room and throw the occasional bolt of lightning at the nearest conductor. Tesla coils remain popular today, though often for their ability to put on a fantastic lightning show.

Nikola Tesla believed in wireless power with such an enthusiasm that with the financing of JP Morgan, he constructed a giant apparatus, the Wardenclyffe Tower, at his lab in Shoreham Long Island in 1901. This was before the world was wired.

The idea? To send wireless power around the globe. 

Here's how it works. Run an electric current through a coil of copper wire and the coil will produce a short-range magnetic field. Place a second coil within this field and an electric current will flow through it. The magnetic field has transferred electrical power from one coil to the other. This principle is called induction, and it has been understood for more than a century. Induction is what charges a wireless electric toothbrush, for example, and it works well over extremely short distances. Pull the coils apart and the power transfer ceases.

It turns out that the trick to longer distance power transfer is the same principle an opera singer uses to shatter a wine glass from across the room; it's called resonance. For the opera singer, when the frequency of the sound wave matches the unique resonant frequency of a glass, the acoustic energy is converted to kinetic energy at the highest possible efficiency. The energy then builds inside the glass until it shatters.

The coils that Witricity uses to transfer power wirelessly are magnetic resonators. First, a rapidly oscillating electric current is applied to a coil at its specific resonant frequency. This creates a magnetic field in the region around the coil. Tune a second coil to the same resonant frequency as the source and it will couple, resonating anywhere within that region and converting the oscillating magnetic field into an electrical current within the second coil. This response is called highly coupled magnetic resonance, and it hasn't been done before. By attaching the second coil to a device such as the battery of an electric car, or a mobile phone, this current can be made to do useful work. The source can be either centimetres or meters away from the device being powered and can deliver power through walls or around metal obstacles. The power can even be distributed across multiple devices at once. So by a simple trick of physics, power is transferred wirelessly. Nikola Tesla would be proud.

Witricity is developing a system, not a specific product, and as a result they have many different platforms on display at once. In Witricityâ€™s demonstration rooms a flat-screen television is powered using a resonator hidden in its base. Laptops, with their batteries removed and replaced by resonators, flicker on, and flash lights glow when placed next to a source concealed behind a bulletin board. The system can even be extended beyond the range of a single source using passive resonators. By this method, many cabinet lights are lit well beyond the expected range of the single source below.

The applications of wireless power in a wired world are endless and rethinking infrastructure may be decades away. A simple first step could be removing costly batteries from things as mundane as computer accessories and, instead, placing a small wireless resonator in the computer itself, tackling waste by centimetres at first.

Wireless power has in fact been available for decades, just waiting for a clever user to snatch it out of the air. It exists in radio and television signals and is available 24 hours a day. Intel labs in Seattle, Washington, are pointing their devices at television antennas and powering small but useful gadgets solely off of the energy that carries TV programs.

Josh Smith says wireless ambient radio power harvesting might yield a milliwatt or so. To a device, that's not very much. It would require 20 milliwatts to keep a mobile phone in standby mode, but it might be enough to perform some useful low-power functions.

Nikola Tesla's tower was torn down in 1916. Mr Morgan, his financier, was uninterested in broadcasting electricity that people could so easily harvest for free. Instead we strung wires and built meters. Tesla knew that wireless power transfer was possible but he never saw his dream realized - it seems that soon enough we will.

University of Washington Bioengineering Professor Gerald Pollack answers this question, and intrigues us to consider the implications of this finding. Not all water is H2O, a radical departure from what you may have learned from textbooks.

Pollack received his PhD in biomedical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He then joined the University of Washington faculty and is now professor of Bioengineering. His interests have ranged broadly, from biological motion and cell biology to the interaction of biological surfaces with aqueous solutions. His 1990 book, Muscles and Molecules: Uncovering the Principles of Biological Motion, won an ""Excellence Award"" from the Society for Technical Communication; his more recent book, Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life, won that Society's ""Distinguished Award."" Pollack received an honorary doctorate in 2002 from Ural State University in Ekaterinburg, Russia, and was more recently named an Honorary Professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He received the Biomedical Engineering Society's Distinguished Lecturer Award in 2002. In 2008, he was the faculty member selected by the University of Washington faculty to receive their highest annual distinction: the Faculty Lecturer Award. Pollack is a Founding Fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering and a Fellow of both the American Heart Association and the Biomedical Engineering Society. He is also Founding Editor-in-Chief of the journal, WATER, and has recently received an NIH Transformative R01 Award. He was the 2012 recipient of the Prigogine Medal and in 2013 published his new book: The Fourth Phase of Water: Beyond Solid, Liquid, and Vapor.

I discovered nixie tubes in 2011 and since then, I've devoted all my time to studies of nixie tubes and its manufacturing processes. After years of intensive work, with help of many people, I eventually succeeded and have revived the knowledge and equipment for production of nixie tubes.

Now some of the greatest economists agree that automation poses a serious threat to the economy, with jobs disappearing and inequality on the rise. Today, those proposing radically new ideas to deal with this problem are being called crazy and idealistic. Old ideologies are outdated in the face of exponential change; we need to embrace a more holistic and adaptive system.Â I believe experiments with unconditional basic income, coupled with the utilization of crypto currencies and blockchain-based technologies, will help us find the answers.â€™
