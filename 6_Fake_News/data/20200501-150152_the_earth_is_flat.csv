I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc.  I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.

Response to Globebusters - The Earth Still Isn't Flat,Education,2125318,"66,404","8,562","Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy.

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth ""model"" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

I received a BA in chemistry from Carleton College, and performed graduate studies in both synthetic organic chemistry and science education at Cal State Northridge, receiving an MA in the latter. Prior to this I taught for about a decade in various high school and undergraduate settings, specializing in organic chemistry but also teaching general chemistry, physics, and biology.

This channel is certainly for students in science courses at both the high school and undergraduate level, but it is also for members of the general public that just want to know a little more about the world and how things work.

Visiting North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4353921,"21,307","2,344","Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Making Liquid Nitrogen From Scratch!,Education,5791631,"61,272","2,955","I used a nitrogen membrane and Stirling cryocooler to liquefy nitrogen out of the air. For this video I partnered with Starbucks to celebrate their Nitro Cold Brew. Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmullerMaking liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.Borrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the “permanent” gases.A French Physicist Aimé compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didn’t liquefy.Only at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.It's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature.",PT13M43S,2019-08-16,2019-08-16,11323,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,dCXkaQa53QQ,"An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.",769396395,0,6920000,False,288

Between India and Pakistan – the Sikhs | Free Full DW Documentary,Education,340047,"4,251",470,"India and Pakistan traditionally have hostile relations, but there is hope on one front, at least. In order to enable the Sikhs from India to make a pilgrimage to one of their holiest shrines, a ""peace corridor"" has been opened between India and Pakistan.Sikhs constitute the fourth largest religious community in India, but find themselves caught between India and Pakistan, between Hindus and Muslims. The majority of Sikhs worldwide live on the Indian subcontinent. The hostile relations between India and Pakistan since partition in 1947 meant that for decades Sikhs from India had huge obstacles to visit their holiest shrines in Pakistan.Despite ongoing political tensions - especially concerning Kashmir - 73 years after their separation, India and Pakistan have fulfilled a promise that was made 20 years ago:  on the occasion of the 550th birthday of the founder of their religion, Sikhs in India can now use a new border crossing to make a pilgrimage to the mausoleum of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan - four kilometers behind the border. The Kartarpur Corridor was opened on schedule by the prime ministers of the two countries - albeit not in a joint ceremony. Both spoke of a new ""Peace Corridor"". The opening of the corridor on 9 November 2019, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, was no coincidence; Indian prime minister Narendra Modi directly compared the two historic events. This documentary accompanies an Indian Sikh who goes to Pakistan for the first time as part of a very special pilgrimage, while for outsiders also providing a better understanding of Sikhs as well as India and Pakistan.Urdu and Hindi subtitles are available.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

I have a knack for explaining science stuff and I want to share my knowledge with you.

I received a BA in chemistry from Carleton College, and performed graduate studies in both synthetic organic chemistry and science education at Cal State Northridge, receiving an MA in the latter. Prior to this I taught for about a decade in various high school and undergraduate settings, specializing in organic chemistry but also teaching general chemistry, physics, and biology.

This channel is certainly for students in science courses at both the high school and undergraduate level, but it is also for members of the general public that just want to know a little more about the world and how things work. My goal is to increase science literacy in our society so please share these tutorials with anyone that you think might enjoy them. Happy learning!

Why the US drinking age is 21,Education,3661891,"91,885","3,450","Why is the US drinking age 21? And how did it happen?

Learn more at http://bit.ly/video-labAfter prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.Further readingWatch President Reagan’s speech about his alcohol policy.

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed.

TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time (4K),Music,33875790,"1,427,974","37,801","Support my work on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/melodysheep  |  Get the soundtrack: https://bit.ly/2HKl9fi  |   How's it all gonna end?  This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. We start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.This is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.To me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species.

Does Planet 9 Exist?,Education,3028675,"79,340","2,126","A planet has been predicted to orbit the sun with a period of 10,000 years, a mass 5x that of Earth on a highly elliptical and inclined orbit. What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?Huge thanks to:Prof. Konstantin Batygin, CaltechProf. David Jewitt, UCLAI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.Special Thanks to Patreon Supporters:Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige ThormanMusic from http://epidemicsound.com ""Observations - From Now On"" ""Magnified XY""",PT16M20S,2019-09-13,2019-09-13,133222,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,20,pe83T9hISoY,"An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.",769396395,0,6920000,False,288

But after a decades long civil war, fishermen returned to find their fish stocks depleted – and they pointed the finger squarely at neighboring India. As Indian fishermen developed methods to increase hauls, and crossed a maritime border that was more permeable during the war, they depleted the fish stock for both sides. Now, the Sri Lankan Navy is retaliating with force, only making the relationship between the two communities that rely on these waters worse. This Vox Borders episode will look at how the drawing of a maritime border and lack of access to fish caused a conflict between two communities that used to live in harmony.

Start listening with a 30-day trial and your first audiobook, plus two Audible Originals free when you go to https://audible.com/veritasium or text veritasium to 500500Huge thanks to:Dr. Robert Lang https://langorigami.comProf. Larry Howell https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.Some of the work shown is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. EFRI-ODISSEI-1240417.

Making SOLID Nitrogen!,Education,3040136,"45,066",369,"What happens when you decrease the pressure around a liquid? It boils. Water boils at room temperature once the pressure is low enough. What is interesting is that this decreases the temperature of the liquid. The fastest molecules escape, leaving the slower ones behind.Using this trick with liquid nitrogen, it is possible to create solid nitrogen at a temperature of -210C. We then poured the solid and liquid nitrogen mixture onto a tray of water. The surface of the water became so cold that CO2 solidified out of the atmosphere on its surface. Then, since CO2 does not pass through the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, it was propelled on the water surface by jets of gas as it sublimed.Huge thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte.Music by Kevin MacLeod of Incompetech.com (Mirage)",PT4M43S,2012-09-24,2012-09-24,113231,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,rM04U5BO3Ug,"An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.",769396395,0,6920000,False,288

North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,Education,5524976,"38,324","3,095","North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator’s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In particular, 52,000 unaccompanied children were detained between October 2013 and June 2014. With what seemed to be a looming humanitarian crisis to deal with, the Obama administration enlisted the help of Mexico, and President Enrique Peña Nieto's administration. Together, they launched the Southern Border Program initiative: the U.S. provided funding, equipment, and training to Mexico in exchange for a crackdown along Mexico's southern border. After all, many would-be migrants from Central America to the U.S. must pass through Mexico first. This policy worked for a few years, but levels of undocumented migrants are on the rise again.

The party had a grandeur never seen before in the world's recorded history. It had delicious food from the world's best restaurant, exquisite drinks, luxurious accommodations, medieval European style decorations, and more importantly - the party had the most decorated guestlist - heads of states from 65 different countries, emperors, kings and queens, princes and princesses, sheiks, sultans, and business figures of all kinds from 5 different continents. The venue of the event was not some ancient castle or a seven-star hotel, instead, everything was organized from scratch, in the middle of a desert, by building plastic tents.The cost of all of this? Not a million dollars; Not a billion dollars; this party almost cost a dynasty. It proved to be a stepping stone for the rise of the Iranian revolution and the fall of the Iranian Monarchy that changed the country forever.-------------------------------Thanks to my friend Alec for narrating my videos.

I have a knack for explaining science stuff and I want to share my knowledge with you.

I received a BA in chemistry from Carleton College, and performed graduate studies in both synthetic organic chemistry and science education at Cal State Northridge, receiving an MA in the latter. Prior to this I taught for about a decade in various high school and undergraduate settings, specializing in organic chemistry but also teaching general chemistry, physics, and biology.

This channel is certainly for students in science courses at both the high school and undergraduate level, but it is also for members of the general public that just want to know a little more about the world and how things work. My goal is to increase science literacy in our society so please share these tutorials with anyone that you think might enjoy them. Happy learning!

First Flight on Another Planet!,Education,1699926,"63,435","1,048","The Mars Helicopter aims to make the first powered flight on another planet when it takes off on Mars as part of the Mars 2020 mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover.How do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:Have large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).Plus the aircraft has to be light:The Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!One of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:Temperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.The craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible.

Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4253181,"45,985","3,097","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",PT14M49S,2019-09-19,2019-09-19,11113,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,1VPfZ_XzisU,"An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.",769396395,0,6920000,False,288

We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iván TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com ""Experimental 1"" ""Serene Story 2"" ""Seaweed"" ""Colorful Animation 4""",PT20M0S,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,222221,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,20,kTXTPe3wahc,"An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.",769396395,0,6920000,False,288

Casey Neistat: How 800 Days of Vlogging Made and Destroyed Him,Music,174597,"6,953",264,"Shop: https://jakezeeman.com/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jakezeeman/ Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/1264098... Casey Neistat is a YouTuber with nearly 12 million subscribers. He’s best known for his daily vlog series which lasted over 800 days straight until he finally called it quits. Daily vlogging existed before Neistat started doing it, but he gave the genre something it desperately needed: quality. Casey brought 10 years of professional video experience to a subgenre that rewarded amateurism. And in doing so, he helped popularize the vlog format and elevate it to a real art form.
