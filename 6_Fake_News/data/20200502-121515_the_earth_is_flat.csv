Why all world maps are wrong,News & Politics,14833987,"249,381","14,675","Making accurate world maps is mathematically impossible.Follow Johnny on Instagram www.instagram.com/johnny.harris/Help us make more ambitious videos by joining the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-labMaps are flat representations of our spherical planet. Johnny Harris cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat.His struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion.To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.For instance, the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries while distorting the size, especially near the north and south pole.For a more accurate view of land area look at the Gall-Peters projection, which preserves area while distorting shape.In the end, there's not ""right"" map projection. Each comes with trade-offs, and cartographers make projection decisions based on the particular tasks at hand. But if you are interested in seeing an accurate depiction of the planet, it's best to stick with a globe.Interact with projections: http://metrocosm.com/compare-map-proj...Mercator tool: http://thetruesize.com/Mike Bostock Map Transitions: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3711652Mercator Puzzle: http://hive.sewanee.edu/ldale/maps/10...Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 5.

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",PT14M49S,2019-09-19,2019-09-19,213,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,1VPfZ_XzisU

The 10 Things That All Flat Earthers Say,Education,1140974,"49,172","4,628","So it's been a minute since I made my response to the Globebusters, and for two months now I've had to listen to flat earthers spew the same nonsense in the comment section of that video, day after day. Now that I'm intimately familiar with their most popular and most ridiculous talking points, I thought I would put them all together in one clip for a vigorous debunking.My original flat earth video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...My response to the Globebusters:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDy95...How to actually calculate earth's curvature:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wyzj...Proving that moonlight is not cold:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLsZw...",PT18M31S,2019-07-02,2019-07-02,121,Professor Dave Explains,/channel/UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,20,KyD8VIK032o

Response to Globebusters - The Earth Still Isn't Flat,Education,2141270,"66,859","8,587","Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel ""Globebusters"" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth ""model"" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.
