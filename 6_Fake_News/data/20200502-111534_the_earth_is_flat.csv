Destroying Flat Earth Without Using Science - Part 1: The Moon,Education,172011,"16,371",781,"My last flat earth video didn't sit too well with their ""community"", to say the least. My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend.

Response to Globebusters - The Earth Still Isn't Flat,Education,2140717,"66,848","8,586","Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy.

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth ""model"" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 5.
