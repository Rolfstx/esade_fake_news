The 10 Things That All Flat Earthers Say,Education,1140783,"49,168","4,628","So it's been a minute since I made my response to the Globebusters, and for two months now I've had to listen to flat earthers spew the same nonsense in the comment section of that video, day after day.

If the Earth is flat, why is the moon round?2. If the Earth is flat, why do we have tides?3. If the Earth is flat, why do we use globes?4. If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 5. If the Earth is flat, why do we orbit around the sun?These are all wonderful, painfully obvious questions, but as often occurs in nature, what's painfully obvious is painfully false. The Earth is flat, Bigfoot is real, and we never landed on the moon. And this video proves it.

Destroying Flat Earth Without Using Science - Part 1: The Moon,Education,172011,"16,372",781,"My last flat earth video didn't sit too well with their ""community"", to say the least. My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them.

So how do you deal with the complexity, the sheer pressure, of dealing with dangerous and scary situations? Retired colonel Chris Hadfield paints a vivid portrait of how to be prepared for the worst in space (and life) -- and it starts with walking into a spider's web.

10 Challenges For Flat Earthers,Education,436598,"24,924","2,510","I can't count how many people have asked for another one of these, and I figured it's been quite a while, so why not mock the flatties one more time. In this video I point out ten blatantly obvious and trivial things any flat earther could do to substantiate their model, that they totally never and will never do. It's hard to fathom that there are a few hundred of them left, maybe I can pick a few off with this one.My original flat earth debunk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...My response to the Globebusters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDy95...My response to the ridiculous comments on the above video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyD8V...My astronomy playlist for people who want to learn real things about space: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Watch Bob the Science Guy take the reins from here: https://youtu.be/i75todogrEI",PT12M55S,2020-02-28,2020-02-28,123,Professor Dave Explains,/channel/UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,20,AQl8h7Aa75s
Response to Globebusters - The Earth Still Isn't Flat,Education,2140717,"66,848","8,586","Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel ""Globebusters"" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth ""model"" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

The Earth is Definitely Not Flat,Education,424532,"15,236","2,547","Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?Want to see dozens more Flat Earth takedowns?
