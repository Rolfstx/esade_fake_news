If the Earth is flat, why is the moon round?2. If the Earth is flat, why do we have tides?3. If the Earth is flat, why do we use globes?4. If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 5. If the Earth is flat, why do we orbit around the sun?These are all wonderful, painfully obvious questions, but as often occurs in nature, what's painfully obvious is painfully false. The Earth is flat, Bigfoot is real, and we never landed on the moon. And this video proves it.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend.

            "description": "Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?Want to see dozens more Flat Earth takedowns?

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?Want to see dozens more Flat Earth takedowns?

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend.
