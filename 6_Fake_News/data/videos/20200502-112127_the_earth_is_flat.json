If the Earth is flat, why is the moon round?2. If the Earth is flat, why do we have tides?3. If the Earth is flat, why do we use globes?4. If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 5. If the Earth is flat, why do we orbit around the sun?These are all wonderful, painfully obvious questions, but as often occurs in nature, what's painfully obvious is painfully false. The Earth is flat, Bigfoot is real, and we never landed on the moon. And this video proves it.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'Code for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Quantum...I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iv\u00e1n TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'Code for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Quantum...I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iv\u00e1n TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

            "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",
