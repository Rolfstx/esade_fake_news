Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, refusing to answer direct questions and changing topic whenever he's cornered, so I'll have to deliver the knockout punch on the second round, should such a thing ever occur.Modern Day Debate: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_cd...",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, refusing to answer direct questions and changing topic whenever he's cornered, so I'll have to deliver the knockout punch on the second round, should such a thing ever occur.Modern Day Debate: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_cd...",

            "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

            "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, refusing to answer direct questions and changing topic whenever he's cornered, so I'll have to deliver the knockout punch on the second round, should such a thing ever occur.Modern Day Debate: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_cd...",
