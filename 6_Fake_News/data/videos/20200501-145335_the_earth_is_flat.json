If the Earth is flat, why is the moon round?2. If the Earth is flat, why do we have tides?3. If the Earth is flat, why do we use globes?4. If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 5. If the Earth is flat, why do we orbit around the sun?These are all wonderful, painfully obvious questions, but as often occurs in nature, what's painfully obvious is painfully false. The Earth is flat, Bigfoot is real, and we never landed on the moon. And this video proves it.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

            "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

            "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

            "description": "Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel \"Globebusters\" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!My original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...The Globebusters livestream about me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J32rh...Learn more from me about astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...My other debunking pals:Conspiracy Catz: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbuO...SciMan Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRts...Kudos to UNIROCK for helping me get this video reinstated after the Globebusters tried to flag it: https://www.youtube.com/c/unirocktv",

Now that I'm intimately familiar with their most popular and most ridiculous talking points, I thought I would put them all together in one clip for a vigorous debunking.My original flat earth video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC5Ra...My response to the Globebusters:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDy95...How to actually calculate earth's curvature:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wyzj...Proving that moonlight is not cold:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLsZw...",
